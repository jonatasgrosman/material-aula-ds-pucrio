"1","I got food poisoning after eating at this location, I almost went to the hospital after about 12hrs of vomiting and diarrhea. I will NEVER eat Arby's again"
"3","For the price, you definitely get what you pay for at Barro's.  The pizza isn't amazing, but it's filling and decent enough for a lunch-on-the-go.\n\nTheir lunch buffet special is really affordable, though, so they usually fill up fast around noon on weekdays.  If you go, expect to wait in a line for a few minutes."
"2","what a messy place! If you want to look a good bargain you have to look carefully because everything is chaos! Even Big Lots has more order. Not worth my time."
"1","DO NOT GO HERE!  Watch out - they will ruin your clothes and then give you the biggest, most expert run around you can ever imagine if you try to get them to replace them.  The owner is a blatant lier and she will rip you off."
"3","My review is based on the service.  I have always received great service from this location and have nothing to complain about. However, Taco Bell's quality of food is another story. If you have the extra couple bucks, get a real taco or burrito from Chipotle or Los Taquitos nearby. However, if you like cheap and tasteless food then this place is perfect for you. I only gave them a better rating because they have fast and quick service. The food quality is out of their control but I wouldn't give a business five stars solely on service."
"3","We got the 14 minutes or it's free deal, and boy, do they make sure the food gets to you in under 14 minutes, even if it means the hamburger is bloody & the salad looks like it's been sitting in the back of the fridge for 2 weeks. They didn't charge us for our food, thank goodness, but I won't go back there to that location or ask for that deal again."
"1","Holy crap does this place not have ANY customer service in their DNA.\n\nAs the retail customer and the person that ultimately keeps them in business, you'd think they'd be a little warmer, more helpful and willing to work with you. They are not. In fact my wife and I found them snobby, condescending and not at all helpful.\n\nDuring the remodel process, we had to go to the slab yard a few times, each time felt like we were an inconvenience to them. \n\nThe final trip to Arizona Tile came a week before fabrication. Our fabricator Diamond Granite (see their AWESOME review on Yelp, went to confirm our slab was there. He asked them to pull it for us so that we could see it at 1:30PM as we had a very limited window of time to view the slab before picking up kids at school. When we arrived, they were once again too busy for us and had us take a seat. When we got to talk to someone they were unaware of our slab and asked who had our paperwork? How are we supposed to know? We were told they never pull a slab until a customer arrives and we'd have to wait for a large truckload that was now being offloaded. \n\nWe told them we had to be out at 2PM. It was now 1:45. At 2PM, we were told to be patient. At 2:15PM someone went out to see if the slab was there. It wasn't until 2:20PM a full 50 minutes after we arrived, that we had minutes to confirm our slab choice.\n\nI couldn't wait to get out of there. My wife and I hated the experience of working with Arizona Tile. The other company we looked at was Bedrosian's and the experience there was night and day different.\n\nOur recommendation: Go to Bedrosian's first for great customer service. If they don't have what you want, be prepared to get crappy customer service in exchange for the larger selection."
"3","The mainstay driving my 2-star rating is the fact that they had NO water in any of their vending machines or at the food counter. In Arizona, you must, must serve water. They had old brewed tea and Power aid drinks, but fundamentally, I can't believe they didn't have water.\n\nBatting Cages- Good\nGolf Driving Range- Good\nBumper Boats- Water was not clean and looked gross\nMini-golf- Okay\nGo Carts- Seats were really torn up and a lot of the cars didn't work\n\nThis place is operating on a thread. Minimal staff and they drained every fountain in the park to save on money. I can't totally blame them for that."
"1","This review is for the miniature golf only.\n\nIf you are in Tempe you don't have many options for miniature golf nearby. It's either Fiddlesticks or Golfland Sunsplash. If you are trying to figure out where to go, go to Golfland. They at least have interactive courses, some variation, and working \""streams\"" for about the same price. At Fiddlesticks the courses are very plain and repetitive. They might be good for practice but are not a lot of fun. Also Google maps may send you the wrong way finding Fiddlesticks. It's on Elliot in Tempe between Priest and Hardy not Chandler by Alma School."
"1","Worse place ever! Old bad equipment, no one working and they sell rides by time and no one working to assist....huge waste of money and when we complained they could not even locate a manager! WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY!!!!!!"
"5","I can't say enough nice things about Autoplex Autoservice. After figuring out that we may have bought a lemon from a used car dealer, we took our car here to get it checked out. Unfortunately our worst fears turned out to be true, but Lou and Mike have gone above and beyond with their service and advice, even though it turns out to be uneconomical to get repairs done. I will definitely be using them in the future when we get a new car. \nIf you want honest, friendly and excellent service, look no further."
"2","It's a chain, so I know the food is decent. I'm mostly turned off by the fact that I couldn't come here to watch a baseball game. No sports package at a popular burger place? I'll be going elsewhere for dinner."
"1","Disgusted by server who goes by the name of \""Mike\"" and how he served my children!!!!!!!!"
"3","Consistently mediocre food. One day you might get wings drowning in sauce, and the next day get scarcely any. Other than that, you pretty much know what to expect here. The food is just OK, the prices are just OK, service mostly just OK - unless you get Jared and then service is 5 star. My biggest gripes - it's always WAY too loud in the bar (loud music makes people have to shout across the table) and they charge 50c for blue cheese when they have a wing special. Really???"
"1","Service was excellent by Jessica & Emily in the bar! Very disappointed that they don't offer anything for our Veteran's, being that it is Memorial Day weekend.. Take care of our Veteran's and I'll give  but only one star for now!!!"
"1","This place is nasty. A have friends who recently contracted food poison from their bone in wings. Someone in that kitchen isn't cooking food right. I'll never go back. Drive to a different location."
"5","I have been practicing yoga for years and have had the opportunity to be in class with some wonderful teachers in a few different cities. I am now \""full-time RV-ing\"" & many times have to practice yoga with a cd or iPhone ap or just put together a practice of my own.  I prefer this type of home practice over a studio or teacher that does not inspire me. But when I am lucky enough to happen on a beautiful space & inspiring teacher I really appreciate it. \n\nSuch a place is Gilbert Yoga! I practiced this morning with Heather who I believe was subbing for someone else & boy was I lucky!!  And because we will be in town for 6 more weeks I purchased a 10 class pass & look forward to returning. \n\nI have returned twice since the my draft above & had the opportunity to practice with Cassandra, who was also a wonderful teacher - thoughtful, peaceful & full of happiness.\n\nNamaste"
"3","The Pizza and Wings are good by the Buffalo native's sense of flavor and quality. The service is just \""OK\"" and nothing to write home about. The other menu items are a mixed bag depending on what you order. I've been here 4 times so it is good enough to keep me coming back, but definitely not as good as it could be with better placeware, real napkins, better service and maybe a more customer engaging attitude."
"4","Loved the stadium recliner seats - this is a super KID-friendly area and the theatre was packed with the wee ones. Good if you're in the parent zone, but if you're not...."
"5","Bryant Pest Control is the Best.  They are affordable, and truly take care of their customers.  when they arrive at our home they are always professional and very courteous.  We appreciate the Excellent customer service they supply and well as their flexibility when it comes to scheduling.\nthank you for the continued excellent service."
"5","We have been using Bryant Pest Control for a couple of years.  They are always on time, neat and professional. The phone person who calls the day before they spray is always in an upbeat mode and a pleasure to talk to.  Like most people, we are not fond of bugs.  Accordingly we have Bryant Pest Control out once a month, year round.  Never an issue and rarely do we see any bugs.  If you are not having them spray every 30 days, you might wish to consider that program.  To us it is money well spent."
"3","I love Petco, it's been my go-to place for all my pet's needs (and I have a few), and I've always found what I needed here at reasonable prices...until recently.\n\nThey have really started marking their prices up considerably and I'm not sure why. Not a dollar or two, but over four and five dollars on things that you can get at Target at the lower price. Bad news. (This applies to treats - not to specialty foods)\n\nThe good news is that this place has a good selection, they are never out of anything I need and the people are really great. It's a pleasant place to shop. \n\nJust please adjust your prices to match with the big box stores, overpricing things you can get elsewhere for cheaper just seems like a bad idea (and I will gladly make an extra stop to save $5).  Even the rewards program here doesn't help with that!"
"5","I had a great pedicure and it was only $20! My tech took a really long time making my nails look great, so I felt like I got my money's worth.  Only complaint is that they could use some new chairs."
"1","First and only time I'll ever go to this location. The guy at the window was straight up tweaking! I'm talking legit meth head, paranoid schizo status, scratching left and right and extremely jittery. I'm surprised he even managed to get my drinks out the window into my hand without spilling them! Yikes... \n\n\nSay no to meth and Burger King for that matter, kids."
"2","Not a huge fan of this place, although the barber did give me a proper fade. I would have to say its over priced for mens cuts and way to long of a wait.... its not a super cuts and its not a high class salon either so in my eyes it is very useless"
"3","Got my hair cut,  styled &  colored.  Was ok but wasn't wowed or anything.  Stylist didn't seem like she wanted to color my hair how I wanted it so had to do it something else.  Came out ok but not totally I  love with it..... Then she had to dye my hair twice because first time it didn't come out right.  Service is great just didn't love my hair how it came out &  definitely over priced."
"1","Tired of going through the drive thru, ordering what I do and getting something totally different by the time I get home. Has happened more then three times in the last 6 months. I don't get as to how hard it is to get an order right.  I have spoken to the manager and called and they just don't seem to care. They fill like you are trying to get a free meal out of them. And you know what? They should give me a free meal for always screwing up my order.. Frustrated! YES I AM darn it."
"1","I've been frequenting this pharmacy for at least 3 years, and I find this review is long overdue.  I'd like the start by saying the pharmacists here are skilled and knowledgeable, even if they never remember who I am.  The techs they have working here are another story, Not only are they not skilled, and not knowledgeable, they very obviously lack general customer service skills.  \n\nI have two of my scripts set up on auto fill, every 90 days.  For those of you not familiar with the auto fill concept, it's supposed to take the hassle out of refilling your drugs, with the pharmacy taking care of contacting your Dr and filling it on time.  In the last 12 months, my auto fill has been messed up 3x, considering it only fills 4x a year, that's not really impressive.  Each time it's been a different excuse, and each time I end up making multiple phone calls and trips to the pharmacy to get it straightened out.  This last time, it took me 3 phone calls and 3 trips.  \n\nThe techs with whom I spoke to on the phone were rude and argumentative.  After I gave up on calling and went in person, with a reasonable solution, Ada (the tech attempting to assist me) spent a solid 15 minutes arguing with me, insisting what I was asking for could not be done.  Since this wasn't my first rodeo with Cvs, (I had them perform this request before), I knew I was being bs'd.  While a line of angry people formed behind me, she got flustered and took a phone call.  Apparently she decided she was no longer going to help me.  One of the pharmacists stepped up to help the next person in line, and she told him to help me instead.  I explained my plight to him, and he resolved it in less than 2 minutes.  \n\nThe moral of this story is if the techs don't know how to do, they will tell you it can't be done.  They have no interest in actually helping you, and are not concerned with the lack of customer service they provide.  On my last call, I informed the tech that I found her inability to provide a solution unacceptable, and her response was I can't change it....no admission of guilt, not even an apology, just pure attitude and contempt.  So go ahead, mess up my prescription, catch an attitude with me and refuse to fix it.  I'm sure that will work out for you in the long run."
"4","They got great service but they have slow wifi download rate......down is 1.10 mps and up is 0.60 mps .... That sucks... Lol"
"5","At nails of the world they actually care about u as a person. They do great work & my polish never peals. They are Always friendly. I've been going there for a couple years now & I would recommend nails of the world to anyone of my friends & family."
"3","It's a Target. You know the drill. Clean, well stocked, good prices. I'm a regular."
"1","So..I hardly ever write reviews for places (as you can see) and I just felt compelled to after I picked up another round of dry cleaning that was less than great to say the least. I have tried out Meridian a few times since I ive in the area. Like other Yelpers have said...great for men's shirts. My husband's shirts come out fine. Thats because they require no work. I could do it, but why? So now on to my laundry...they can not seem to iron or press my shorts on the crease for the life of them and have now managed to just make my shorts look like crap. On to the button up I took there the other day (I dont really know how this is that different from a mens shirt except it was short sleeve) well where my sleeves roll up it was not pressed and was not rolled up properly....like the person that was taking care of my shirt really had no idea what they were doing. I did just as good of a job in my bathroom the next morning with my flat iron on my shirt. On a seperate previous trip I took in a dress that said \""dry clean only\"" after examining it for what felt like ever (it was not super nice just had some silver designs) they asked if I had it dry cleaned before and I said no, but the tag said \""DRY CLEAN ONLY\"" they then refused to dry clean it because the silver \""would come off\"" - Something I highly doubt as I have put it in the washer since and it has been fine.  These are just a few examples of the crappy results I have had from this place....so needless to say, even though yes, they are close and yes, they are cheap I will NOT be going back. I will be going to the more expensive, further away dry cleaner that seems to know how to do their job properly."
"2","Been going there for years.  Sadly, after the manager left, this place has gone down hill very rapidly.  It is too bad cause this drycleaner use to operate pretty smoothly.  I can't possibly recommend them to anyone if they can't keep good help around there. So long..."
"4","went here for lunch with my boyfriend. we came on a friday so they had specials going on. its a really big place. they have peanuts on the table which is awesome and bad cause they are addicting! lol. we both got beer. i ordered a blue moon and like it should, came with and orange slice! my boyfriend got a hamburger and i got tacos. they were really good! i would definitely go back to this place!"
"2","This place is like any other in the Gilbert area. Not a good bar, not a good restaurant, but a mediocre place trying to be both. It has very few dinner specials and a poor beer selection. I considered leaving after I looked at the menu. But I was starving and they had peanuts. The food was OK, the service was nice and pretty quick but the place was empty. I won't be returning here."
"4","My hubby and I took the kids there and sat outside during happy hour. The service was great, they had decent HH specials on both drinks and food. The kids had fun with the peanuts. We were the only ones outside and our server did a great job of remembering we were out there. I think it would have been pretty pricey to have a full dinner there, but the HH specials made it affordable with 3 kids."
"4","All PPP have the same layout.  This one I have to say is cleaner than the others.  Kids are everywhere!!!  The pizza was not bad.  The wings are not too bad either.  They did an excellent job on my friend kid's birthday.  The person dedicated to the party she got every detail down and timed it just right.  Everyone had a great time."
"5","Always a great place to bring our little one (4 years old) Games are Fun, pizza is always great. Prices haven't changed much over the years. Highly recommend for anytime of day and any occasion."
"5","We love Dr. Quackenbush and all the staff at Timber Falls!  I have four kids going there ranging from age 3 to 11 and each one of them enjoy going.  Dr. Quackenbush is very professional, caring, and honest and when there are issues with my kids' teeth he always goes through each option available and lets me know which one is the best for that child and the situation (not the one that would pay him more money).  One of my younger daughters has had to have several baby root canals done there and still never hesitates to go back because they always take such good care of her there and never make her feel uncomfortable.  I highly recommend Dr. Quackenbush!"
"2","Target has a promotion they call Holly Jolly Savings.  It is promoted as spend $50 on Holiday items and get $10 off at the register. Sounds easy enough!  I fill my shopping cart with holiday Items and get to the check out..  My total was $171.80.  I showed the cashier my coupon, she scanned it  and told me my purchases did not qualify.  Really?,.....I ask how much more do I need to spend to qualify?  She does not have a clue but suggested I inquire at the customer service desk.  I go to the customer service desk and the clerk also has no clue to how the promotion works, but he was somehow sure I did not qualify.  I told him I would no longer be shopping at Target and he smiled and wished me a good day.  Officially added Target to my do not shop there anymore list along with Sears and Kmart..  I added a star as they have incredible shopping carts."
"3","Since we're going to be moving right near this place, we checked it out.  It's not like our favorite hangout Dizzy's, but it definitely has a cool vibe.  A bunch of us checked it out on Friday night and the people watching alone is worth it.  \n\nForgot the bartender's name, but she was awesome and took care of us never leaving us dry.  \n\nIt's a small bar on the outside, but great music and a few pool tables on the inside.  Check it out if you get a chance!"
"4","Thai tea and a doughnut.  Aside from not being what the diet doctor ordered , the sweet on sweet may not have been the best combination idea I've ever had, but separately, both were good!\n\nPop was out but definitely a mom'n'pop kind of place.  Nice down-homey little doughnut & sandwich & coffee shop.  Very nice lady behind the counter, her young son hanging out unobtrusively nearby.  Worth a stop if you get a hankering for sweet fried delight while you're in the hood on south side of Olive at 47th Ave."
"1","I made an appointment at this location 2 weeks ago. When I show up at the agreed upon time I am informed there isnt an appointment under my name. Instead of apologizing for their error, the representative immediatley states I must have called the  wrong location and proceeds to call a nearby store. Of course, they didnt have anything under my name either, but that is because I didnt schedule the appointment there. You would think at this point an apology would be appropriate but no, I am told they are booked solid and the vehicle might get squeezed in if left all day. After further review a sliver of time is found for 3 hours later. Guess who is the only one inconvenienced, the one that made the good for nothing appointment to begin with. As we all know the key to taking a reservation is holding it, anyone can TAKE a reservation."
"5","Fucking BENTO BOX!!!!  Oh man,  getting diabetes has never been so delicious.  These boxes are massive to the point where you can barely close the thing.  It's as if the food is fighting imprisonment so it can raid your taste buds for all they're worth.  These babies have dumplings, rice, fried pork, teriyaki chicken, and a small salad so you don't feel so bad about it afterwards.   Which you won't. \nNow if you don't want to look like a total slob you can get the Teryiaki Chicken bowl.  (Spicy is my thing but hey, you can puss out if you want)\nOne massive bowl of rice and meat later and nothing seems so bad anymore.  Not even the dead hooker in your trunk can steal anything from this afterglow."
"3","My family and I are such BIG fans of the Jalapeno Dynamites, sometimes it's hot and sometimes very hot.  We don't care we love it!  I would like to see at least one steam side in the future, but I suppose fried sides are more popular here.  The food is delish...it wouldn't hurt if they change up using different vegetable(s) sometimes instead of the ever popular onions and cabbage in some of the chicken dishes.  The teriyaki chicken and broccoli could be substituted with a different vegetable for those who are allergic to broccoli.  I love the vegetable bowl minus the broccoli.  I love some of the sushi rolls esp. the specialty ones, BIG portion sizes.  Miso soup is so good too.  The owner-manager is the only one who makes the best sushi so I understand he can't be there 7 days/wk.  It wouldn't hurt to call beforehand if he's there or not if you're craving for sushi."
"1","A friend of mine was just talked into joining this gym last week. 18 year old who hadn't experienced the classic \""gym\"" sales crap.\nAFTER they accpeted his membership fee and first and last.. THIS GYM IS SHUTTING DOWN in TWO WEEKS!! What a joke! \n\nSo everyone was correct in their previous posts that this place should shut down but they shouldn't have accepted any memberships knowing they were closing in two weeks."
"2","Do you want to die shortly after being slapped in the face with a cover charge that shouldn't be charged and then having your girlfriend gang raped on the dance floor?\n\nIt receives two stars simply because I used to like the place.  Pool, good music, dancing, reasonable drink prices.  But, after a couple of tense situations, witnessing fights on a near weekly basis, and a parking lot shooting....I'll pass these days.\n\nI don't do karaoke so that side of the establishment might be okay."
"3","Spit your gum out before you enter. Be prepared to get frisked. Bring .50$ for the locker. And forgo all fear and enjoy yourself. \n\nYes, it's swarming with young 'uns on Saturday night, but don't let them whizzing by you, showing you up, discourage you from letting your inner child come out to play. In fact, laugh much, laugh hard and don't be afraid of falling. \n\nI fell once, taking my date down with me. Ha! It was the highlight of my skating experience. So funny. \n\nI wasn't sure what to expect, but Great Skate is alot of fun. If you aren't pro enough to skate backwards or play the games, just watch. It's fun, too. \n\nI recommend this place and roller skating for when you need to break away from reality and just enjoy yourself. \n\nI give this place only 3 stars because it's not in the greatest neighborhood (hence security measures) and you have to be ready for a bunch of kids running around and, well, being kids. If you can handle either, then you're golden."
"2","Dr. Bischoff is wonderful ONLY IF:\nA) You are rich and/or have the Cadillac of insurance plans.\nB) Have no health issues\nOtherwise, don't waste you're time and money (even with the voucher).\nI purchased the voucher ($99 of service for $50). I sent my husband there for a cleaning and he needed 2 small gumline fillings. We were visiting AZ from MA for 6 months only. Dr. Bischoff scared the Heck out of him by insisting on testing him for mouth cancer due to his oral exam of his mouth (test = negative thank God) . Then, he tells him he has gingivitis which will require deep oral scalings (four) at a cost of over a thousand dollars. When my husband explained that we were only here while I was at the Cancer Institute for treatment and that he only wanted a basic cleaning and to get the two small cavities filled (they were hurting him when he ate) and that we couldn't afford the suggested treatment,  Dr. Bischoff flatly refused to do anything until the deep scaling - which would take 3-4 months to perform - was completed.\nSooo...I guess Dr. Bischoff only cares about you if you are rich enough to afford whatever treatment he deigns  to do regardless of what you really need and can afford done. My poor husband was sent away, still in pain and now feeling horrible because we don't have the money or time to have this large procedure done...all because he is my primary and only care giver and terrible me had to get Cancer and spend most of our money coming to the Cancer Institute of America in order to try and save my life. Sounds a bit chilly for such a \""caring individual\"".....although they did send a \""happy birthday\"" email to him on his birthday (yeah, not much to celebrate with aching teeth and a dying wife). Nice marketing strategy...\nOh, and by the way, we have an excellent dentist back home in Boston, MA whom we regularly see and have been with for over 20 years...He has all the best /latest and greatest equipment too! Upon arriving home, my husband went to him and he doesn't have gingivitis and was right to refuse the deep scaling as due to his health conditions, which include a heart murmur and high blood pressure, the regular dentist has never done a deep scaling. All knowledgeable dentists should require a medical clearance from a PCP prior to performing deep scalings as people with these conditions can have strokes or heart attacks from the debris dislodged during the procedure which travels into the blood stream. My husband's PCP will not give the clearance.\nTypical example of all gloss and glamor but no substance. Real nice digs and alot of expensive toys for the doc to play with but so much for sincere compassionate care!"
"3","Happy hour prices pretty good. Spinach artichoke dip and tortilla chips kind of salty. Our server was Olivia who made a pretty good Long Island iced tea but wasn't as attentive as Racquel was the last time we were in. Still overall we love the food here, usually good."
"5","They have the best pizza, we drive 50 miles to get this pizza. There wings are also great and you can't beat there beef on kummelweck it is so good. We have also had there subs and pasta dishes and all is great. So don't hesitate about going to eat here it is so worth it."
"2","Sunday morning before 11am we were there and it was packed to the gills at this IHOP. OMG, the waiting area inside was full, the wait area in between the inside and outside doors were full and the entrance has about 4 people stand around. WOW! We waited about 20 mins for 5 of us. \n\nThe menus were sticky and mine had a smashed paper liner of a straw in it. The table looked clean and the seats were redone. The place got HOT, there was a lot of people. \n\nI got the ham and cheese omelet. It was a little dry. The french toast was pretty good. \n\nAll in all, meh...."
"1","Went to eat some pancakes this morning and of course being a Sunday it was very busy. We had to sit outside because they had called our name and we didn't show so longer wait. We sit outside, order drinks and food but it took about 30 minutes to get our food. Our food finally arrives but they forget my husbands food. We thought maybe they're still making it but they forgot because we asked what was taking so long and turns out his food was just sitting there. Very frustrating. Didn't bring us syrup or ranch for my food until very late. Our waiter was very bad charged us wrong and wouldn't let us settle the ticket up at the front desk. Never going there again honestly I'll just stick to Denny's."
"5","I was greeted right away by a very friendly staff.  Even those I was late I got started right away. I appreciated the little extra time Tina and Hyeu took to make sure my nails were meticulous! They run a clean shop and do an excellent job! Thank you Kathy for the humorous chit chat on the side.  I am coming back for certain"
"5","Keep in mind - ***** - \""Woohoo! As good as it gets!\"" - IN ARIZONA\n\nBeing that my Thai grandmother's blood runs through my veins, and it's all I had growing up at home, I'd like to say that I'm a pretty credible Thai food yelper.  For the past MANY years, this is the only Thai restaurant that my parents will dine in. \n\nTheir menu is pretty eclectic since they offer everything from stir-fried noodles, noodle soups, stir-fried meat/veggie dishes, and fried rice. I had the pad Thai the last time I went to pick up take-out about 3 weeks ago. It was WAY spicy, but I asked for it. Despite the streams of sweat that were rolling down my temples, the noodles were delicious! My other favorite dish here is the pad kee mao which translates into stir fried drunkard. This dish is best spicy as well. I highly recommend this place if you're in the area and love authentic Thai food."
"1","Do not come here! This place is packed full of people waiting to have an abortion and it's really gross. They don't take time to explain anything and they will not even let your boyfriend or husband in the ultrasound room if you want him there. You can definitely find help somewhere else where you are not treated like cattle!"
"5","Now, I am very hesitant to give a dentist 5 stars.  I mean if I was rating dentists as a whole, I would give them negative stars.  I have gone to a *lot* of dentists in my day and would never have considered giving one above 3 stars.  Then, I met Dr. Wyatt.  \n\nFirst, his helpers are super helpful and friendly.  They are nice and sometimes when they ask a question, they actually take the tools out of your mouth for you to answer!\n\nSecond, Dr. Wyatt himself follows suit and is nice.  Even when you have issues he's nice about it.  He doesn't lecture or raise his voice or even seem angry that you don't do something, like oh floss all the time...  He truly seems like he wants you to have a happy, healthy smile, not like he is frustrated with your behavior.\n\nLastly, his office is called \""Reel Dental\"" and they have a movie theme.  Though somewhat cheesy, it's nice to have movies on in the waiting room and such.  Rumor has it that when you go in for long dental work, which I never have, you can watch a movie while it's done!  Anything to take your mind of the fact you're in a dentist chair is great.\n\nOh, and for the ladies, he's quite easy on the eyes to look at while being worked on!"
"4","This place has really good halal kohbedays.  However they close pretty early and are not even open on Sunday's . There hours are M-S 11-9."
"4","Every once and a while I need a little Grand Dragon in my life!\n\nI stumbled upon this place when I was working on a house in Glendale and needed to fulfill my need for some Chinese food - and then I was hooked. For under $10 I can get general's chicken with brown rice, crab puffs, spring roll, and lo mein. Oh and you want to add a side of sweet and sour chicken to that order for $2.95 - perfect!\nThis food is delicious and affordable. Trust me you will get filled up and have some to take home for lunch the next day! The service is always great and the restaurant itself is comfortable!\n\nAnd I'll have to cut this review short to stuff some more general's chicken in my face!\n\nCheers!"
"2","Thought we'd try to stay closer to home and saw the reviews for this place, not so bad. Was greeted by a super friendly guy who quickly changed from friendly to downright annoying. He took our drink orders as soon as he seated us, was back in a flash and asked if we needed more time. Yes, we did. Two minutes later, asked if we were ready. Nope, sorry. Again. And again. I don't know what his hurry was but he was determined to get our order within 5 minutes of us walking in the door. Whatever. \n\nI ordered the house chicken. When it arrived I was surprised, they give you a lot of food! I thought I had hit the jackpot! It was crispy, not overly sweet or spicey. Very good. We had a lot of leftovers, everything turned out great.\n\nUntil about 5 hours later. I was pretty gassy after that but whatevs, I don't mind farting and I'm pretty gassy anyways. Then it became painful. I knew it was coming and it was going to be hot. I got the shits. Explosive. Seven times. \n\nIt's hard to tell what exactly has turned your ass into a chocolate fountain by the end of the day...but I won't risk it again."
"5","What can I say.... This is hands down one of the best places to eat!  Visit probably once a week and always request the same waiter.  Service is great, food is excellent, prices are perfect!"
"5","We are here all the time.  We sometimes blow in late and announce to our waiter that we are really pushed for time.  They just smile and accommodate us.  Our food comes out piping hot, perfect and within an amazingly short time.  Their cheese crisp is the best in town, as is their tortilla soup.  My husband's favorite is the \""E\"" (he says, \""E for Excellence.\"")  It's a chicken chimi, basically.  They also make a really nice chicken taquito, ... you get four presented in a mini flour taco shell on a bed of lettuce.  Yum!  The service is friendly and I would suggest this restaurant to anyone who loves good Mex Tex."
"1","RUN!!!  This place was not a good experience.   We rented a car from the PHX airport and went to this location to trade it in since the original car was shaking at high speed on the highway.  The Ford Escape they offered us a the location is an embarrassment to the the whole company....it was filthy dirty, smelled like smoke and vomit and was an older model with high mileage.... I thought it was a joke at first........ they also had a bad attitude that we didn't want it........ughhh...we finally got a Chevy Impala, but the building was filthy and this place needs to be torn down ....."
"3","Friends called me yesterday afternoon and asked me to stop and have a beer with them and watch the ALCS game.  Sort of a cool neighborhood bar with a small bar food menu.  Most of the patrons seemed to know each other or were in small groups at a single table like we were.  I counted 7 screens but I forgot to see if there were any over by the pool tables.  4 pool tables, 7 dart boards, shuffleboard and a couple of video games.  The tables and stools are all anchored.  The door has been replaced with a privacy wall in the men's room and the one stall looks like the door has been removed and replaced a few times.  The padded rails on the tables need reupholstering.  Overall the place seems in pretty good shape.  They have a fenced in smoking patio but I didn't see any chairs or tables on it.\n\nI had a toasted ham and cheese on sourdough ($5.75)and I chose to have it with onion rings, although I could have chosen fries or cottage cheese.  It was good and I thought a pretty good deal.  I had MGD long necks at $3 each.  Not sure if that was happy hour or regular price, I didn't ask.  \n\nAll the employees I dealt with were pleasant and efficient.  I Left by 7 so I don't know if the vibe changes as the evening goes on.  I noticed several folks just like me that joined friends and left after a drink or two.  I had a good time with friends and wouldn't hesitate to go back again.\n\nThe woman opening up early Saturday sure looked at me funny taking pictures of the place as she walked up to the door. :-)"
"3","That place is very, very dark but the beer mugs are big and cold! lol. The service was good and their BLT was yummy, plus they give you a BIG portion of fries. I was bummed that I was there during the wings and onion rings but didn't get any. Boo!! Maybe next time :)"
"1","Wish I could give them zero stars. The other reviews are spot on. They don't want your business. They refuse to honor Subway coupons. The employees act rude and condescending. Their prices are more expensive than other Subways in the area. I'd recommend the Subway at 51st and Olive if you're looking to eat at Subway in this neighborhood. Avoid this one at all costs!"
"4","Their green chile burritos are great! Enough for my husband and I to share too. Really love the chips and salsa! Better than many other places!"
"5","I think Korina might have mixed this place up with somewhere else - or perhaps has an ex-boyfriend working there... \n\nCommunity Tire is one of the most professional companies I have ever done business with, and they definitely stand behind their work 100%.\n\nI have used two of the Community Tire locations and had nothing but perfect results. Fast, fair, friendly! Plus, they give back a lot to the local community."
"5","I still love this campus BUT I do agree with the angry person that if you want the quintessential party college experience, this campus (and Poly) are not for you.\n\nThis is like a liberal arts college in that most of the classes are less than 30 people, some have up to 100 but it's not large lecture style like Tempe and other universities.\n\nIf you don't care about partying and you live in NW Phoenix then this school is AWESOME!"
"1","I do not give 1 star reviews lightly, but this business is beyond unprofessional.  Their business practices seem to change with the mood of the owner, and it is the customers who suffer."
"4","5 corn dogs for 5 bucks.......Tuesday special on Milkshakes for 1.29......Franks made with Chicken instead of Beef or Pork.....Priceless. This establishment is great place to stop after going to an NFL.....NHL...MLB....or Spring Training game because it is near all of those facilities if your head back to the East Side of the Valley. The restaurant is very clean....the staff is nice and the food is very good. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!!"
"4","I love this location because it's right on my way to work... I had a breakfast sandwich here once that I wasn't too fond of  so now I just get the regular bagels - the spinach florentine is my fave. \n\nThe lines can get kind of long here in the morning, but the staff so far has done a good job not making everyone wait too long. Nothing worse than having employees who don't give a rat's ass, so I'm glad it's not the case here. In fact, everyone has been really nice here always saying good morning and smiling...at least every time I've been here."
"1","Terrible pharmacy! Can't say how many times they have messed up my prescriptions. And even when it's been their fault their answer is \""once it leaves the pharmacy nothing can be done\"" if they just had an ounce of customer service instead of just being flat out rude I wouldn't mind so much. From here on out ill drive the extra 15min to another just so I don't have to deal with them again."
"3","Mom came in by ambulance on Friday with a fractured femer on the left leg where her prior hip repleacement from 2005 had taken the hit from her fall. The old hip was removed and a new hip with a longer leg shaft was inserted. She has been out of it for several days but Wednesday she finally walked and Thursday she was more herself again. The food has been good for hospital food and the nurses have been wonderful. No one enjoys waiting around the ER or waiting for tests and all of the other things that happen in a hospital. But this is a very nice facility and staff. And believe me with Dad having a stroke and various surgeries and Mom being the $6million woman with this her 6th major surgery I have experienced lots of hospitals!"
"5","I didn't expect to have to visit Banner Thunderbird again so soon after the birth of my son on 7/16 but an emergency arose that caused us to have to return with him. The pediatric ER was FANTASTIC. They made us feel at ease, were prompt with their care of our baby, and provided answers quickly with what our next steps were. \n\nUltimately, we had to stay overnight and stayed in the pediatric unit with our baby so here is part 2 of our visit....\n\nThe Peds unit is OUTSTANDING. Our nurses, Robyn and Jamie, were kind, understanding, and very professional. We were treated like friends rather than just patients. Our pediatricians during our stay was professional, nurturing, and didn't allow us to beat ourselves up over our baby's issue. But the best part of our visit was our tech, Mary. She treated our baby like he was one of her own kids and she treated us like royalty while we were there. \n\nThough I'm not looking forward to having to go back to the hospital, I know that when I do have to go back, I will receive excellent, high quality, nurturing care from Banner Thunderbird Medical Center."
"3","Unfortunately, my father has had a few emergencies relating to his heart/lungs. Most recently, he stayed at this hospital. I absolutely loved the nurse (forget her name). She was very attentive and caring, even though she obviously had to care for many other patients.\n\nI was disappointed in the doctors, however. My father's ailment was in relation to his diet. In addition, my father has diabetes. In this kind of situation, I would think a nutritionist or dietician would be sent to speak with the patient about what kinds of things would be best for them to eat, especially since poor nutrition choices are a big part of the issue.\n\nOverall, this is a nice, clean hospital with a *mostly* diligent staff who care about the patients."
"1","Having car problems is already bad enough. Labor was expensive but expected for a franchise. Customer service on the other hand was awful."
"3","I have gotten take-out from here about once a month for the past three years. I normally get the chk broccoli and my husband gets the kung pow chk or the happy family delight. It is not the greatest Chinese food in the world but I like it and they give you a good portion size for the price. Try it out... if you don't like it you only wasted about $7."
"1","I've come here twice. Both times the vet tried to up-sell lots of tests and prescription pills. \n\nThe first time I thought they really were recommending what is for the best- and I actually did get the Xrays that they advised, though I had them done at a different vet's office, because it was significantly less expensive. (Those xrays didn't explain any of the problems either). The 2nd time, when I brought a stray dog in that looked significantly underweight. The vet said  she could feel the dogs liver... and as she began to explain the next part she hid her hands in her pockets, a classic move made by a person when not being forthcoming, and said it could be a mass, but it could also be because the dog is skinny. She said the dog looked pretty good other than that and she'd write up a action plan for getting the dog back in good health. She then left and sent in a tech with a itemized bill for blood work and shots over $500 worth. \n\nI then attempted to clarify what I came in for. I wanted to know the dogs health, if the dog appeared neglected or sick and what to do to help the dog gain the weight back. I wanted to know roughly how old the dog was, and what I could do to help the dog get healthy. I've never owned a dog before. I also said, I noticed the dog seemed stiff and I could hear her joints pop when she moved sometimes, and I would like information that could answer questions like, Should I give the dog glucocamine?\"". Is it an injury or just because of the age? The tech left to speak with the vet again, and then returned and said, the vet says the dog is about 5, though we can't really confirm that. Here is the Prescription she wrote up. \n\nAt this point, I was very aggravated. I exclaimed that I wanted information, dietary advice. My main concern was that the dog was underweight due to lack of food. I want to know things like what type of food is best to help the dog recover. I've NEVER even had a dog before, which I said when I made the appointment and stated several times throughout the appointment. The tech looked baffled, and I told her that I was not going to return to this clinic ever again. I went to pay and I told them that I felt swindled. I explained that I still didn't even have answers for simple questions on what type of food is best to feed an underweight dog, and I didn't understand why their office couldn't give basic care advice and instead just kept writing up quotes for tests and drugs. \n\nAt that point the tech came to the front and said she talked to the vet and the vet wanted me to have a handout about arthritis. I admit, I sarcastically thanked her for giving me information that I could have easily looked up myself online, and explained that now I still need to look up dietary information online and I think it's ridiculous that I should have to do that when I just paid $50 to talk to a veterinarian and have the dog examined. \n \nI left promising to contact the Better Business Bureau. Which I probably will do. \n\nI'm just at a point in my life where I'm sick of not getting what I pay for. Is anyone with me on this? It's like I can even by an f%#^$^% sweater that won't unravel in a month because everything is made in China by 5 year olds, I buy used cars around 60,000 miles, because new cars are put together so shoddy that used cars with that kind of mileage already have new transmissions and alternators and starters... The repairs are better quality than what you actually get when you buy the car, unless you get a mechanic that insists that you have replace a $500 part in order to fix a $200 part, when 3 other people gave you quotes that didn't include that repair- or an electrician that insists the lighting in your business needs to be replaced or the lights aren't going to turn on, but when they find out that there isn't anyway to authorize that type of repair a miracle from heaven unfolds and the lights magically work once again. \n\nHere's the truth people. Everyone's out to get your hard earned money, and few ever offer quality service or merchandise in return. \n\nThis veterinarian could have given me some advice like, since she's under weight you might want to feed her a puppy kibble or some wet food, or increase the portion- and also it wouldn't be a bad idea to do some blood work to see her overall general health. I could respect that, but not offering any advice on the animal whatsoever except for the tests and drugs, seems a bit ridiculous. And if they can't tell me anything about the health of the animal without the tests, then someone explain to me WHY ON EARTH THEY ARE ALLOWED TO PRESCRIBE DRUGS? If you are that clueless as to the health of the animal without your $500 full work up, then how can you in confidence recommend $50 worth of prescription drugs? \n\nThe only redeeming quality that I have to mention about this place, is the techs are nice and friendly."
"2","Not bad, a little oily. Not sure that I like it. Might have to try it again."
"2","Started getting pizza here after moving to the area and sometimes it was good, other times, I felt that the pizza had way too much cheese and was too salty. Recently, we ordered more items including, pizza, chicken parm sandwich, cold roast beef sandwich, and mozz sticks. The pizza was cold, not cooked enough, very heavy, too much cheese. The chicken parm barely had any chicken on it, chicken tasted frozen, def not fresh, bread was so soggy, too much sauce. The sauce is horrible. It didn't taste fresh at all, was very dark red, salty, either cooked way too long, or had too many spices in it. The roast beef sub was gross, roast beef was gray and rubbery, not good quality meat, asked for extra oil and vinegar, and sandwich was drenched in olive oil. The mozz sticks were not fresh at all and as hard as a rock. Will NEVER give them my business again. Total waste of money and nothing at all like NY style pizza or food. (59th Ave location)"
"5","This has got to be the cleanest, nices, only non-smelling pet supply food store I have ever been to.  We came here today because they had a special event for kids like, petting zoo, fire truck, corn tub for kids to play in, Easter magnet making, & master gardeners to answer questions.  We hung out for about and hour and bought some feed for our chickens at home that we also bought at The Stock Shop.  I highly recommend this spot even if you have to drive a little....remember, pets mart stinks."
"1","I called this business to get an estimate for tile roof repair and no one ever called me back.  Bad business ethic.  They have an answering service, so there is no excuse.  Probably if I would have said that I needed a NEW roof, I would have received a call.  I even gave them the name of the person who referred them to me."
"1","I was jogging in the area and noticed signs, so I went to check it out. The place seems nice enough, but I got the impression the manger Ed and his son seem to run the place and would rather sit all day and collect their pay checks. I would love to know how much money they make sitting around all day hoping no one comes in and bothers them. I think I'll contact the city to see what is up."
"3","I keep getting behind on my Yelp reviews and blogging so I have been toying with the idea of having a computer at home for quite some time.  Recently I have been looking at the Best Buy ads and this weekend I finally decided to pull the trigger.  I almost got there on Saturday but ran out of time and found on Sunday the same laptop I intended to get was on a 2 day sale that included a free 3 in 1 printer.  Best Buy has in the past not always honored an internet sale price at their stores.  I could have ordered it online for in store pick up but I wanted to pay cash and I haven't figured out how to do that over the internet.  So I called the toll free number and the woman I talked with didn't know if I could reserve one on line or not so she gave me the store phone number.  Talked with Terence and he started by saying my sku was too long but he typed it in anyway and found it should ring up properly.  He then spent about 10 minutes finding the computer and printer and leaving them for me at customer service.  When I arrived I picked up some other items to go with them and a sales rep answered several of my questions and then I picked up my computer at customer service and payed for all it it right there so I didn't have to go through checkout also.\n\nActually a rather pleasant experience.  Over the years I have been in several Best Buys, this one the most.  Sometimes the service is lacking and sometimes like this time it is great.  They did try to up sell me on a few things but not nearly with as much pressure as they used to.  As the sales guy on the floor went over what this computer does compared to my office computers that are 7 or 8 years old he explained about writable DVDs but forgot to suggest I get some and I didn't catch it either so I will pick some up some where."
"1","Horrible customer service.  Seeing as how many of the floor employees are college-aged or somewhere thereabouts, their social skills are about as sharp as a high school student listening to an iPod at full volume while looking at the ground.  There are obviously employees who know all the right techno-jargon (I could hear them talking amongst each other), but not once did ANY employee offer to help me.  They all just seemed to be paired off in conversation with other floor workers without a care in the world, and far be it from me to interrupt them.  There was a general atmosphere of \""don't bother us, we can tell you're not a techie.\""   I was prepared to spend a fair amount of money on a new computer, and associated software, but due to the fact that they did nothing to help me, I took my business elsewhere.   Of course there are plenty of stores that have employees asking if you need help every two seconds, which can be annoying, but at least you feel valued as a potential customer.  At Best Buy Arrowhead, they can really take or leave you it seems.  I am a college kid myself, and I needed this equipment for school.  I was frankly angered by their obvious ignoring of myself and my brother. \n\nThe one redeeming thing:  although I was bothered, and subsequently left the store, the woman at the door said \""have a nice day.\""  At least one person gives a damn."
"1","I knew beforehand that going to best buy wouldn't be a good time, but I needed a charger for an electronic device ASAP. I brought the device with me and after trying for about 10 minutes, I was able to hunt someone down to help me. He took me to the section, opened the box and took out the charger and attached to my device. It was a little loose but he said I could just return it if it didn't work. \nNow it is certainly my fault for not knowing their return policy when purchasing, but it's 15 days. I came in three days late to return it (it didn't work) and they refused to return it. She said they could have still returned it, but in had been opened (I purchased it already opened from the store!!) I get that the return policy is 15 days, but come on. Any other store would have still done the return for a customer and at least offered store credit. I'm surprised they haven't gone out of business yet."
"1","Horrible service. Nobody to even help find out if they have more product in the back. I was in there for half an hour before I had to ask if anyone was available to help or if they're all just taking a break. Most employees just sulk around sittin at their posts, not even willing to walk around and put in work. And when they finally did make it around to asking me, the product I was looking for was out of stock. \nTwo things you need to work on. Keeping product in stock and having available associates rather than mindless desk zombies."
"2","This review is for people who have never worn a wig but want to 'try it'. My natural hair is highlighted blond and I wear it fairly short. They didn't have much of a selection for that in stock on the day I went in so I allowed the sales person/manager to convince me a highlighted reddish auburn wig was perfect for me. Two other customers in the store agreed so I was swayed and spent $140. I think I probably did look good in it - if you didn't know me. The change was just too drastic and I could tell by the looks I got from social acquaintances that it wasn't \""me\"" (my husband and favorite waiter at Abuelo's agreed). Everything about the color screamed I was wearing a wig. I know wigs are not returnable but I did want to call the manager and just suggest to her that when dealing with new wig wearers that she doesn't try to convince then that a totally different look works. It doesn't. Now if you are known for the variety of wigs you wear, it's a different story. She was defensive, of course. I certainly wasn't trying to get my money back - just letting her know my experience and I would not be wearing the wig."
"2","Had enough beer to think this was one of those hip, retro bars.\n\nPlatinum blonde indie girl spinning old-school gangster rap from 20 years ago...IRONICALLY. It's cool because you're superficial and don't expect her to play that. \n\nBunch of guys repping Extreme Sports fashion like Monster Energy caps with their Ed Hardy shirts...IRONICALLY. It's cool because no one seriously wears that anymore, and it's a great throwback to simpler times. \n\nNot much for pastafarianism, I tried chilling out with my modern, 2010s clothes and music taste. Didn't fit in. But fear not! Chilly Bombers has some redeeming aesthetics. Like...the pretty lights (so bright!). Or the huge (and unfortunately vacant) dance floor. \n\nWhen I closed my eyes just long enough to stop the spinning, I envisioned how much cooler this bar could be if it tried to be a little more dive-y, and a little less of a refuge for people too broke or afraid of Hurricane Bay*. \n\n*I can't believe I just used HB as a favorable alternative to something."
"1","I hate for my first official review to be a one star review but Macayo's really disappointed me last night. When I first pulled into the parking lot last night I was surprised to see how many empty parking spaces there were. I immediately got excited because normally any restaurant on Bell road any night of the week has a wait. However, when I walked inside I saw a slew of people waiting to be seated. I walked up to the hostess stand and put my name on the list and the hostess did not give me a time quote and when I asked how long it would be she quoted me, \""not too long.\"" We waited about 15 minutes before being shown to our table which is where the trouble really began. \n\nOnce we were at our table we were quickly greeted by our server (yay) however, she told us she had another table's drink order to get and then she would be back for ours (boo). So we waited for her to take the other two tables drink orders before coming back to take ours. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes we got our fountain drinks and then 5 minutes later she came back to take our food order. Then it took about 50 minutes for our food to come out. Seriously, 50 minutes.... that's about how long I planned to spend at Macayo's not how long I planned on waiting for my appetizer of taquitos to take to come out. And to top it off we were missing a side of rice and a side of baja sauce. We decided not to mention it as we did not want to wait another hour for the two items to come out. So, after eating and waiting for our drinks to be refilled 3 times we finally got the check to which the server apologized for our wait. Apparently, she couldn't have apologized at all during our 50 minute minute wait she needed to wait until tip time. \n\nI don't recommend going to Macayos. You might have better luck at any of the other 10 Mexican restaurants on Bell Road."
"2","Let me preface this by saying that I've never been a big fan of chain Mexican restaurants. My sister loves Macayo's for some mysterious reason, and I decided to play along since we had relatives visiting from out of state.\n\nThe decor is nauseating. It feels like they took the most obnoxious colors they could find and ratcheted it up on the scale of tacky. However, we came to eat, so who cares what color the walls are?\n\nThe salsa is thin, but tolerable. Nothing special, but I'm always a fan of bottomless chips, so I'll take it.\n\nEveryone else seemed to like their food. I ordered tamales with green sauce. Unfortunately, the first time it came with their \""Baja sauce,\"" which our waitress informed us is cream cheese, heavy whipping cream and jalape\u00f1o juice. She quickly took it back and brought out my correct order. Much to my surprise, green sauce is just red sauce with green chiles in it. At this point, I had fallen behind enough that I scraped most of the sauce to the side and ate my lunch. The tamales had a nice fluffy texture, but the sauce was not what I had in mind.\n\nOur waitress did handle my sending back the order without any fuss. She was gracious and attentive, so for that I'm adding in an extra star."
"2","It's pretty standard chain. Service leaves A LOT to be desired and you'll definitely find better.\n\nTurnaround is quick though and I don't spend a ton of time in the area so it's a quick go to that's right there."
"2","We usually call in to go ordrs as we did today. Speaker for pickup doesnt work, u just have to hope they see u on camera or youll be waiting.. hannah had wrong price so i couldnt contact on speaker- had to run in cause i forgot my cell. They gave me correct price, and my order. I get back to my van n check my bags. Hannah had forgotten half my ordr. No cheese crisp, xtra chips n salsa, and my entire carne asada chimi meal with rice and beans were no where to be found. So now, im making my second trip in cause again, speaker doesnt work. Mind u, hannah has only been out to my vehicle once and that was to get my name for my order and my credit card. I had already given her a $10 tip for my $37 order when i paid.  AND ive gone in and out twice cause she didnt properly check my bags. I shoulda asked her for change since i paid her tip cash. By the time i got back to my vehicle, my initial food brought out first was cold. Hub and I, as much as we like the food, have now sworn off this place for good. Customr service on to go is zero stars the only reason for two stars is the cooks know what theyre doing. Let me make a point of saying I always tip good rght away and normally this gets me good srvice. I pay cash tip even if i use cc just so i know they get it right away, and recognize it...like i said, they appreciate the consideration normally and i get good service.  I'll know better next time i guess. I checked my bags, i made sure ordr and pricng on receipt was correct, i did all the legwork...shoulda tipped myself!"
"2","No wonder great clips is taking their business. They just can't get it right. super cuts has a long ways to go in hiring quality stylists if they want to keep up. I have come out twice feeling something is off and I only come here when the Great clips line is too long\n\nThe hair stylists are always not always smiling, although the manager is friendly."
"5","In searching for more places to eat lunch on the north side of town, we came across Island Teriyaki.  It's an unassuming strip mall joint with a pretty straight forward menu.  Nothing terribly fancy, but it hits the spot every time.  Never seems to be overly crowded, I go with the Oahu rice bowl.  With the buy 6 bowls get 1 free promo I will be frequenting this place more and more, and may try something new along the way."
"4","Love this dive bar! Great service, lots of drink specials, and a very fun atmosphere. My favorite thing to do is play darts but they also have a shuffle board and a pool table.\n\nThis isn't the place to come if you're looking for great food or lots of televisions to watch all the games."
"2","Was driving down the street and saw the Einstein sign as I was almost about to pass it.  Luckily for me there were no other cars in my way and I veered across two lanes of traffic to make it into the parking lot.  The place was so deserted out front that I actually had to check Yelp to see if they were open, confirmed they were then made my way inside.  The place was completely empty so I made my way right to the front.  However once I got up to the counter there was no one there to help me.  Now, I'm not 100% sure a bell went off when I walked in but I'm pretty sure it did, you know, to alert the people in the back when someone walks in in just this kind of example.  I could hear a group of people talking and laughing in the back but no one was coming out to check on the front.  I also noticed a camera pointing at the counter, not sure if that's for management to watch the staff or for the staff to watch for customers but either way it wasn't helping me get a bagel any faster.\n\nAfter a few minutes a girl finally walked out to help me and didn't act very apologetic about the lack of service.  Once she took my order another girl went through the process of actually toasting and preparing my bagel and she was quick and polite.  The bagel itself was as good as I knew it would be and I'll go back to other locations but the service I received at this particular one will definitely prevent me from returning here."
"4","We came in here for dinner and really enjoyed it. I've ordered masala's at other places and they haven't made them as spicy as I like them to be, but here I ordered spicy chicken masala and I received a flavorful hot, SPICY chicken masala. Staff was very friendly and attentive.\nP.S.\nI Love Indian Food! ;-)"
"4","I've been coming here off and on over the years since it used to be right next to the theaters. The theaters are long gone and in place there is a church. The actual store is a lot bigger now. Pretty good selection of books. They have a lot of obscure foreign language/English dictionaries which I thought was pretty cool. That's probably just me though. They have a decent sized collection of vinyl for such a small place. A handful of CDs as well but nothing like the selection you would see at Bookman's. They will buy paperbacks, CDs and vinyl. Prices for what they give you seem a bit random though. Whatever the case, it is worth checking out from time to time."
"1","I have been here before and the selection is okay and the people fine. I went in to sell some books today and the old woman behind the front desk was down-right rude. On top of that, she just meandered around as if we all had all the time in the world while she moved books back and forth between shelves. It was definitely a wasted trip for me and one that I will not ever again repeat. Next time I will go back to Bookmans."
"2","First, I hate any kind of scamming. This is a bar where a lot of locals know one another. I play a lot of music in the juke box and I've been here to specifically play their great juke box and the fact they carry my beer, MGD 64. The happy hour prices are decent, $2.50 a bottle. The staff is friendly. They have 99 cent sliders on Tuesdays and Thursdays, otherwise, they don't have any reduced priced appetizers. On Tuesdays and Thursdays, between 5:00-7:00, the bottles are suppose to be $1.75. I've been in here about 10 times.  10 times I was over charged for either food and/or drinks. These were blatent over charges. I had a coupon for 35 cent wings. I ordered 10 wings. Total should be $3.50. It's not difficult to order 10 wings at 35 cents a piece. They charged me $5.75. I brought this up to the bartender and she kept debating with me that 10 wings at 35 cents each were  $5.75.  35 cents x 10= 5.75?  They follow a chart that's taped to their cash register. She kept saying I was the only person in 3 years to ever complain about the pricing of the wings!!! I said then maybe I'm the only person in 3 years to see that you're overcharging everyone. It was eventually fixed after others in the bar started hearing the conversation, but they didn't agree with me that 35cents x 10= 3.50. The last time I went in a couple weeks ago, I specifically went for the $1.75 beers between 5-7. They charged me for full price happy hour even though I was there on the \""special 1.75 day\"". I've had buy 1 get one free coupons for here, and the free meal was never taken off. I've had to correct this many times. So, I like the atmosphere. It's very casual, decent drink specials, really no food specials, and a great juke box. They do have a very small free buffet with 2 things on it, but it's always gone and not re-filled. As long as you watch your bill and prices closely, it's a decent place to go. I would've rated them a 3 1/2  if it weren't for every bill being wrong."
"1","Trashy dive bar,.gross skanky waitresses who think they are hot,mediocre food, terrible service, only good thing is cheap drinks during happy hour.Also rude doorman.Not worth it."
"3","Going to Padre Murphy's on Fridays for Fish and Chips is a tradition and somewhat a routine for loads of peeps in northwest Phoenix. I had to try it. My first visit was for lunch with a coworker and have been back a couple of times for their Fish & Chips on Fridays. \n\nIt's somewhat of a dated sports bar but with lots of cool sports pics on the walls and plenty of great TVs everywhere to watch sports, horse and dog races. Plenty of room, clean and inviting and even has a couple of betting windows for the race tracks. Their service is exceptional and very consistent with each visit. The crowd is somewhat of an older, couples crowd but kid friendly. \n\nPadre Murphy's bottomless Fish and Chips on Friday has a great taste and it is what a lot of peeps keep coming back for. I've tried some of their Irish dishes and found them to be average or below compared to other places. Their sandwiches and burgers are OK and their open faced roast beef plate is one of their best sellers. But I, like most peeps come here for their Fish & Chips on Fridays. \n\nMaybe I will see you there sometime on a Friday eating Fish & Chips ;-)"
"3","I am torn in writing this review because I have been going to Padre Murphy's for years without issue but my last visit really disappointed.\n\nMy husband and I both ordered burgers for lunch - I got the party melt and he had the mushroom burger. I have ha these before and they were always delicious so I thought it was a sure fire bet.\n\nWe both ordered are burgers medium well. When the food came out, it took the waiter a long time to check on us - I ended up calling him over. My burger was very dry and the party was swallowed up by the bread and bland fried onions. It was also cooked well done, but I didn't feel like waiting for another burger because we had our daughter with us. I didn't say anything to my husband but asked for ketchup for the burger. Then my husband mentioned that his burger was dry and overcooked and he didn't want to eat it so we called the waiter over again. At this point, I kindly reminded him that we had ordered our burgers medium well and these were clearly well. He then started arguing with me. He said if I wanted it slightly pink I should have ordered it medium rare! I told him my experience has always been that slightly pink was medium well. Nonetheless, we asked for a new burger for my husband. By the time it came out, we needed to leave so we asked for it to be put in a box. It was - and with nothing else - no fries or anything. We didn't get an apology, we didn't talk to a manager and we didn't get a discount on the bill. The only thing that really bothered me was the arguing... After all, it's not the waiters fault if the food is overcooked.\n\nOne last thing - I ordered a tall mixed drink and got a short instead... Minor but relevant.\n\nThis was the first time I've been really disappointed here but it was enough to make me write a review. Normally the food and service is great and we love to be able to take part in OTB. Let's hope it's better next time!"
"3","The pool looks nicer than it used to. Music still sucks."
"2","Please update your hours on Yelp. We stopped by to get something framed at 5:32pm and you were closed even though it said 6pm on Yelp."
"1","Just came in. Two people in front of me. Waited. Someone else came in. Large man appears from behind counter, moves to help the people who came in after me. I said \""Need a ...\"" but the people who came on after me were served first. I have bought Iphone batteries, watch batteries here but my next order will be online."
"5","I've been coming to this place for the last 5 years, the staff is always friendly and this place is really clean. The barbers are very professional and well trained. This isn't one of those gay salon's that will massage your head while giving you a reach around, this is a real mans salon. \n\nIf you just want to get a fucking haircut with no lame gimmicks, then this is the place for you!"
"1","Ugh!  I think I am going to be sick!  Please let the record reflect that I did not choose this restaurant.  It was chosen as a meeting place by my sister-in-law sight unseen.  \n\nLocated in kind of a dingy strip mall, the place was pretty full on a Sunday night.  We took this as a good sign.  The staff was friendly and was very good about bringing drink refills and clearing plates.  The restaurant was relatively clean.\n\nLet's get down to the heart of eating out, though, which is FOOD.  The food ranged from unexceptional to bad.  The eggrolls, jalapeno chicken, and fried wantons were not bad, but nothing special.  The coconut shrimp was the best thing  I ate and was actually tasty, but very heavy and greasy.  The hot and sour soup was okay.\n\nDo not be tempted by the sushi.  I am skeptical anytime I see sushi at a buffet, but decided to try it anyway.  It was TERRIBLE!  The one nigiri I had was just awful.  The fish was not fresh and the rice was bland.  The one California type roll was similarly AWFUL.  I hope that sushi virgins are not getting this as their first taste of sushi, because it will turn them off to sushi forever.\n\nThe other items to choose from were standard Chinese buffet fare, but bland and greasy.  Nothing special here.  I was too afraid to try very much.\n\nAfter eating at Great Wall Buffet, I feel cheap and dirty, but I did not even enjoy the experience.  If I am going to be so bad, it had better be so good."
"1","an absolute atrocity to all that is good and edible. you will see bundt cake straight from KFC. and what is up with the sushi roll with strawberries in it?!"
"2","The food was just okay some of it was better than others. My problem is it looks like he's hiring his family that really don't know anything about the food service business. I seen one waiter bringing some food put it on some else's table first because he couldn't hold all the plates, then he moved it to the other person's table. This is because the seating Is so close together I can hear the people next to me you chew their food not to mention every conversation they're having. He tried to liven up the place by having a live steel drummer playing which would be nice if he wasn't sitting right on top of me also. If you going to have people sit this close together dim the lights put some candles on the table or remove some of the tables and give me some space!!"
"3","This place is just OK.  Heavy flavors, etc.  There is pork in the meatballs, which is not mentioned on the menu.\n\nWe have been there twice for happy hour.  It's only worth it because you get appetizers for 1/2 off, drinks/beer are 1/2 off, and house wines are 33% off.  The 1/2-priced appetizers are only available in the bar area.  I wouldn't go there for the full-price menu."
"2","I've eaten here before with varied experiences, but my girlfriend wanted to go out for New Year's Eve dinner so we went.  Prior to arriving she made a \""reservation\"" / \""call ahead seating\"" or whatever they call it at this place.  We arrived at 7:58 for our 8:00 \""seating\"" and there were only two couples waiting.  This should have been my first clue as every other time I've been here the place has been crowded.  Even though there were only two couples waiting, we were told it would be 15 minutes (you could clearly see empty tables).  At 8:19 our pager went off to be seated (kind of funny they gave us this since we were ten feet from their stand and as stated earlier there were only a few couples waiting).  As we walked to our table, I noted seven empty tables and had only seen two parties leave.  I'm trying to account for why we waited so long when we had a \""reservation\"" and there were empty tables. Oh well, let's just enjoy the meal.  My girlfriend ordered Chicken Alfredo and I the Conchiglie Formaggi.  They both arrived just warm (the restaurant was particularly cold last night) and our server didn't offer fresh grated parmesan. Both dishes were bland but were palatable, hence the \""Meh, I've experienced better\"".  Truly the best part was the fact my belly was no longer growling and we could head out for a great New Year's Eve celebration."
"3","This is my neighborhood Sprouts.  The one time manager of this store used to live downstairs from me and I had no clue what he did for a living until long after he accepted a position with another company.  After I found out what he did I mentioned I had only been in 2 Sprouts and had liked the produce in the first one I went to (83rd and T-Bird) but when the new one opened at 51st and Peoria, on my way home, I had been disappointed in the quality of the produce and had never gone back.  He explained you do not want to buy meat and produce from a place that does not have lines at the register because they do not turn the inventory fast enough.  He suggested I go a little out of my way and try his old store which does a much higher volume.  If I am in the area I will also still stop by 83rd and T-Bird as they do even more volume.  Some of their stuff is a little high priced but for price shopping I go to Wal-mart or Costco.\n\nSo what do I like to buy there?  Produce, pork brats, fish (Friday I got swordfish), several times a year they have buffalo, chocolate covered raisins (I really have to watch myself). They have Muir Glen ketchup (no corn syrup and great taste).  I have tried some of their breads and chips and not been impressed.\n\nI do not go often but I am glad I took my neighbor's advice and tried them again.  And I have never had more than 3 people in front of me in line."
"5","The evolution of supermarkets towards fresh produce, gluten-free products, organic products when possible, and competitive prices has been a boon to Sprouts.  This is a local chain on the verge of exploding onto the national scene in a big way.\n\nSprouts recently went public and with good reason.  They have 170 stores, primarily on west coast and a rabid customer base. These stores rock!  They are super clean, super competitive and have a fantastic selection of groceries.\n\nThe produce is some of the finest you'll find in town; it's always top notch quality at very good prices.  The meat counter is amazing.  Trust me on this, their chicken sausage (about five flavors but choose the caliente) is fantastic.  We use it a couple of times a month in our spicy pasta dish with mini penne.  The fish is always fresh, it never smells fishy, and the wrapped meat in the case is beautiful and always delicious.\n\nThe general merchandise section has one of the largest selections of natural and homeopathic vitamins and supplements in the valley and an educated staff to help guide your purchases.  \n\nThey have a wonderful selection of bulk foods that has got to be the highest quality bulk in the valley.  The chocolate covered (you name it, walnuts, almonds, raisins, peanuts, etc) are fantastic!  It's a great way to buy just the quantity you need, at a great price.\n\nI've shopped at nearly all of the West side Sprouts and none of them will disappoint you; this is a quality chain that is going to be around for a long, long time."
"2","It's amazing that no matter what me and my family do we can't walk out the door for no less than $30. The food is good , not great. The new cost cutting measures include the servers putting ALL ICE in your cups and 10% soda , and putting a layer of cheese so thin on the pizzas that it's stupid. New employees , same complete idiot type. A girl who came to our table on the same night , served us 2 different pizzas that we didn't order. Then she seemed like she was \""disrespected\"" when we pointed out that the pizza's weren't the ones we ordered. Just save your money. I agree with tabatha , I've lost about 20 pounds since I've stopped eating at major food chains that have taken gross amounts of cost cutting. There's more cheese on the pizzas from the taco bell menus that have pizza hut. Seriously! you get more cheese on that little pre made pizza that comes from the PH factory that what they put on the pizzas when they're making them \""fresh\"". Last one I had smelt like corn chips at this location.\n\nsave your money."
"2","$13.83 for a Tosted mac & cheese No meat.... but they charge like if it had shrimp!   I won't order this again. .. over priced, small portion,  and it's not even the best I ever had."
"4","Thunderbird Pools is definitely better than the big pool companies like Paddock and Shasta.\n\n-Estimate was very straight forward. I told them what I wanted and he gave me an estimate for the work. All the other pool companies kept trying to sell me up and telling me how I needed this and that. \n-Estimate was equal if not cheaper\n-Didn't charge extra for doing simple things like removing the diving board and bolts that was no longer needed after remodel (other pool companies wanted an extra $200 just to do that!)\n-Work was done quickly and on time\n-Had some issues with the pool light but they fixed in a good manner"
"5","I love, love, love Tokyo Lobby!  I go there at least once a week for lunch or dinner.  It is a little jewel in a strip mall that I though was my little secret :)\n\nThe restaurant was introduced to us about 2 years ago through a friend's ex, but that's another story.  At that time it was in a much smaller space, but within the last year they have relocated to a much nicer location.  \n\nThe sushi is phenomenal!  The best I have had in the valley, and I have tried many.  The rolls are to die for - large, flavorful, fresh and they never skimp on portion size or taste.  The staff is attentive and friendly.  Good sake, many flavors and sake bombers - hey why not? \n\nMust try: baby lobster roll, crunch roll, monkey brains and heart attack\n\n(mmmm...i'm salivating just thinking about it!)"
"5","I LOVE sushi! And I love it even more when it is from Tokyo Lobby.  I eat here at least once a week, budget be damned.  I can't help it. I'm addicted.  I probably need some kind of support group. I'm all about the soft shell crab and the blue fin. I am also a big fan of their bento boxes.  You get a lot for your buck.  And for appetizers, the Heart Attack is great (never in a million years would I have thought I would be paying for a heart attack).  I usually go as they are opening, because once lunch hour hits, an available seat will be impossible. You should really give this place a try, it is a real treat."
"5","This place is great whether you like sushi or not. I am not a fish eater, but my boyfriend is. I always order their chicken teriyaki with vegetable tempura and miso soup. All of it is always excellent. My boyfriend orders the California roll (either regular or tempura coated), the spicy tuna roll, and many others. He says it's very good as well. The service is always great and the atmosphere is nice. It's a small place, maybe 15 tables plus the sushi bar. It's not fancy, but it's a nice weekly dining experience that's affordable and great food. Be advised though, they do close from 3-5pm to prepare for dinner service."
"2","It was okay, but \""Meh, I've experienced better.\"" We were a party of 6 on a Thursday night. They made it clear that they close by 9:30pm and that they were ready for us to go. However,the server was pretty friendly and fast.\n\nThe food was just okay. The rolls were very average at best, not tightly rolled. The Catepillar roll had a very sweet eel sauce (more like a maple flavored sauce) and it was hard to eat. We had to remind them that our order was not all complete...perhaps in the rush to get our food out so we could leave by the time they closed, they may have overlooked or order. \n\nI'm confused about how this place got such high reviews, since they didn't even come close in my experience."
"1","The sushi was not at all good. The service was on the poor side. Our one and only visit was not enjoyable."
"2","Nothing special, really.  The prices were great, especially the $5 Sake Bomber special.  But overall, the food was just not sexy at all."
"5","I am new to Arizona, and this is the first Dentist I've been to here. The staff is very friendly, the office is clean and inviting. I had a very pleasant cleaning on my teeth this morning (didn't leave my gums swollen like others). The prices are very reasonable and I will be using them again. Certainly recommended!"
"3","Went there for my daughters birthday and she loved it. We finished our meal tipped the cook at our table paid and was outside talking when the waitress came out and complained we didn't tip her enough cause half her tip goes to the cook. Are you kidding me how is that my problem. And when was it ok to follow customers outside and ask for more money. I was so pissed and shocked that I will never go back to that place again."
"1","Whatta bummer this place is!!  I saw it on DDD and it looked like it was going to be the best BBQ the world has ever produced.   Lucky for me I was heading to my grandpas in Tucson so Thee Pitts Again was only about 45 min out of my way (That's nothing when it comes to good BBQ).  Maybe it was because I was there on a Tuesday at about 11AM and I got all the leftovers from say ummm.......Saturday.  Stupid me I asked the waitress what's good to which I received the standard answered of \""Everything\"" so that's what I ordered give me 1 of everything.   She returned with a huge plate probably weighing 6 pounds everything looked the same, I couldn't really tell what was what.  I think I had about 1 bite of each item paid my $30 tab and went to Weinerschnitzl for some good food."
"3","I was a bit disappointed with the pulled pork. It seemed to be a tad under-cooked. It had a nice smoke ring but there was a lot of fat in my sandwich.\n\nThe atmosphere is great and the waiter was helpful and friendly. With all the self-promotion about all the BBQ competitions they have won, you think their pulled pork would better than what I could make in my backyard.\n\nMy wife leaned over and said, \""Your BBQ is better than this!\"" I guess I'll have to try the ribs or the brisket next time."
"4","Stopped in here for lunch yesterday... and had the pulled pork sandwich with the sole slaw... on an onion roll. Had the baked beans as a side... and of course Sweet Tea! \n\nI loved it. It was so damn good. The meal was about 9 bucks... a little steep in my opinion for a sandwich. The beans were really delicious with little morsels of BBQ beef in it. Unfortunately, I do not get out to this part of town too often, so i do not get to take advantage of all the BBQ goodness Thee Pitts has to offer. \n\nI am glad I get to check off another one of the Dinner, Drivins, and Dives restaurant off my list of must tries!"
"3","Saw it on triple D finally got to try it I got the combo platter lots of meat in the dish. The meat was very good except the sliced ham tasted like turkey ham. Beef rib was not good either sides need work got corn on cob very over boiled. Wife got coleslaw said it was very bland. Overall not bad would go back but would get the chopped meat. Also BBQ sauce a little ketcupy."
"2","Eh - not bad...but not anything to write home about."
"3","Hidden little nook, right next to JcPenny (on the south west side). \n\nIf you are anything like me & don't own a needle & thread (it's sad, I know!) then this is a good place to go if you need to have something hemmed or tailored.\nThey also do embroidery, although that can get a bit price if you are wanting an intricate or large design. My daughter had her best friends initials embroidered onto a small bag & it was $15, reasonable I think, & it came out really nice! It does add a little something extra & makes gifts more personal & thoughtful :)  \n\nAn important note, so you won't be caught off guard, this store works on CASH only & requires pre-payment. \n\nDuring the holiday season the turn around time was 1 week, but maybe now that it's over the wait time is less."
"3","first impression? the couch in the waiting area is filthy and there's no hostess to be found. \n\nwe sat down and received chips and two salsa. we also received two cups and a pitcher of water and then the nice lady walked away. i guess we pour our own water? ok.  not gonna lie, it was kinda messy. we pretty much sucked at trying to pour water. haha\n\neverything on the menu was around $15 which was a bit shocking considering the no greeting, the self serve water and the dirty couch in the lobby.  i guess the feeling i got from the place i was expecting it would be closer to $10 menu items? \n\nour waiter came out quickly and he was the only waiter on the floor. he did surprisingly well. i never felt like we were lacking when it came to needing something. \n\nmy steak fajitas were super tasty-  they let the veggies get crispy and there's nothing worse than soggy veggies. the tortillas were amazing. and overall i was happy with my dinner. it was huge so that $15 plate did stretch for a few meals and it really was worth it because the quality is there for sure (i'm leaving out my complaint about the brownish quac and pale pico de gallo bc i didn't eat them and the fajitas were great on their own)\n\nit was definitely a good choice for dinner. it was a decent family owned restaurant.\n\ni just wish the rest of the experience was relevant to the price of the food. the food is worth the price but the rest was a bit off for me. \n\nin the end- after tip it ended up being about $20 per person. i would probably go again if i was in the area and needing some good mexican food. other than that, probably not. it was a-ok and if they upped the rest of the experience i would most definitely be a fan!"
"3","We came here for Valentine's day because my husband's sprint phone was not working.   We drop off the phone and walked over for a quick bite.  We were lucky we got there before the crowd.  We waited for a few mins, before we were greeted and sat.  Within 15 mins, the place was packed with people.  \n\nWe sat down and received a basket of warm chips and two salsa.  Then we got two cups and a pitcher of water.  The lady did not say anything to us and left.  I was not sure if she is coming back or not.  ???  \n\nThen our server came to greet us.  She was very nice and told us the special.  She took our drink order and swoosh she was gone.  She had a ton of tables.  She came back quick with drinks and to take our food order.  \n\nI ordered the Comb #11 Chimi with chicken served with beans and rice.  The red sauce had good flavor, the chicken itself was bland, the rice was good, and normally I am not a fan of refried beans but theirs was pretty good.  \n\nTo sum up everything, it was ok."
"1","Just ate at this shit box, Ajo Al's in Glendale. Very disappointed in our dinning experience. I wish I'd have read some of the reviews before going. The only positive I have is that the interior was aesthetically pleasing. Completely downhill from there. We ordered two margaritas, on the rocks, with two shots of Grand Marnier. It took at least 10 minutes to get our drinks and the shots of Grand Marnier were only a 1/2 oz. each. We had to request a full one oz. shot, and wait another 10 minutes for it to transpire. The food was nothing spectacular, if not overpriced. At the end of the meal we ordered two more margaritas, this time melon, and again a we waited. Our empty plates and glass wear were never cleared from the table. When we left, the remanence from everything we ordered was still on the table, and everything took exceedingly long... Do not waist your time and money if you are expecting any kind of good dining experience.\nI've had better \""generic brand salsa\"", and I doubt if they even know what a jalapeno is."
"2","Very dissappointed with the customer service. Went there on Friday, 11/15/13 with my family. The waitress spent most of her time trying to upsale. She encouraged us to get extra cream cheese with out pollo con queso (in which we ordered 3). We did, and of course we were charged for the extra cream cheese. My son ordered the kids meal and I explained to her that it comes with a free drink. She already inputted the charge and stated that she would speak with her manager. She never removed the item from the bill. Normally, we overtip on our bill. We usually leave approximately 15% if the service was poor. We left an $11 tip on our bill that was $70.44 ($81.44 after tip) due to the poor service. I checked my bank account today and noticed that our waitress added an extra $1. Total amount charged was $82.44. Ajo Al's just lost a customer for life."
"2","Had you asked me to write the review after my first visit I would have given three stars.  Now that we have been back for a second stop, it has dropped to a 2 star experience. \n\nBiggest plus - the chips are hot fresh and the salsas are tasty.\n\nHowever, the entress are just a soupy mess of sauce, beans, rice and whatever you ordered.  It seems they plate the food, then throw it under a broiler or heat lamp to perfectly melt everything into one congealed mess.  Flavor is jsut ok, as the two stars say, \""meh, I've experienced better.\""\n\nStill on the quest for a better upscale Mexican Dinning experience.  Somewhere where they rice and beans are not one big mess covered in sauce and sour cream.  Somewhere where they take the time to plate a nice plate of food."
"2",".......Where are the chopsticks?\n\nA Chinese restaurant is clearly not Chinese when there are no chopsticks on the place setting! Tea was lukewarm upon arrival, tasted unauthentic, with the help of any ambiguous American tea bag. The hot and sour soup had peas...peas! Side of rice was stiff and tasted as if it had been in the cooker all day. Had the stir fry vegetable dish that consisted of broccoli, snow peas and mushrooms overly cooked to mush; where was my bok choy or kai lan or any type of actual authentic Chinese vegetables?!\n\nOne thing I do give them credit for: service was clean, fast, and efficient.\n\nOther than that, your money's better off at Panda Express right down the street. Same quality of food, and at least there you won't have to pay for tip!"
"1","Wife and daughter ate here and got food poisoning. They had the shrimp lo mein. Beware!"
"2","When we first moved to Arizona we lived in Ahwatukee and Abacus Inn was on restaurant of choice on Elliot and 48th.   Fast forward 20 years and one pops in closer to us so we thought we would give it a try.  \nI liked it, she didn't.  It wasn't the same as we remembered.  Maybe we aged.  Maybe they did.  The place is tiny and packed.  There appears to be a brisk take-out business happening.   The menu appears to be \""lite\"" on menu options and not like other Chinese joints where there are endless pages of options.  \nWe preferred Shanghai on 67th and Happy Valley (in the Fry's shopping Center) as our favorite Chinese in the Northwest side.  \nThere is some serious commentary needed and it's how these Chinese restaurants seem to make take out orders, over in restaurant orders.   They must teach them that in Chinese Food school but I have seen full packed restaurants of people waiting up to an hour + for food, while the take out is brisk.  I have seen people walk in, order takeout and then sit and eat it whiles others wait.   I'm not sure why they do this, but all Chinese joints seem to partake in this mistake."
"5","My favourite Chinese Restaurant. Better than PF or any of that nonsense. I order the Orange Chicken, Chicken Chow Mein or Mu Shu Pork and I love them all! I crave this place and its deliciousness, maybe it's the addictive MSG but for once, I don't even care! \n\nOn my last visit, the owner gave everyone a Chinese Calendar as a holiday gift which was kind! Fair warning, some of the staff are strange but most of them a great! \n\nYou should go there now."
"2","This place drives me nuts!  It's very convenient for me to drop in and I'm mostly satisfied with their food, it's just that they are so slooooow in the drive-thru.  On my last visit I couldn't even order at the menu.  I had to roll up to the window and give my order.  It's not that the menu wasn't working, the gal just wasn't listening or hearing me correctly or something.  I had a question and apparently questions don't fly out at the menu.  When I got to the window and asked \""can you leave a few fries w/o chili on them?\"" the look she gave me was complete bewilderment - like nobody had ever asked her a question before.  Frustrating.  I'll go here again because it's on the right side of the freeway, on my way everywhere."
"2","This is NOT the famous Grimaldis pizza that everyone hears about.  There's a fuss over who gets to use the name, presumably it's either the location on Scottsdale Rd. or the new location just off the 101 at Northern in Peoria.  Either way, this is not the famous Grimaldis.\n\nPizza is very average.  Service is usually poor, and usually from teenage kids with little to no training as servers.  In fact, it's unclear whether it is full serve or not.  Sometimes you have to go up to the counter to order, and other times they correct your behavior and insist that you sit down first.\n\nPizza by the slice isn't so great in the afternoon hours because it is reheated stuff from much earlier with a drizzle of fresh cheese put on top of the old, starting to form skin crusted cheese.\n\nAfternoon happy hour attracts an unsavory crowd looking for cheap chicken wings and light beer.\n\nFamily owned, but who cares if the service is often bad and the food isn't so great."
"4","I love this place - I was so happy to finally find a decent restaurant in the West Valley.  Love that its a local business.  Pizza is great and I've heard so many great reviews about the rest of the menu.  Great casual local neighborhood restaurant!  Great customer service and prices too!"
"2","Chairs are uncomfortable... The only time they act like they understand  or speak English is when your talking about price & times up for massage.  I liked the cucumber scrub & didn't have to wait long.  Not a bad place to go if in the area but I've been to a lot better."
"5","Great coffee. Free refills just keep your receipt. Hazelnut coffee?! with more hazelnut? I'm in heaven. I also got bottom of the pot coffee and my mouth is tingling from the caffeine. LOL. The bagels here are also worth the price."
"3","It's hit or miss at this particular store. At lunchtime-it's great. At dinnertime-not so much. You can definitely tell the difference between the lunch and dinner crew. The line is kept up and the store is clean at lunch. The tables are bussed and the drinks are kept full at lunch. At dinner..again not so much. \n\nSoups are very good, bread items are ok, hot foods are not very good in selection and just blah at best. The salad bar is fresh though and the selection is plentiful. \n\nThe servers are again very hit or miss. The lunch crew is nice and personable. The dinner crew--well let's just say they spend A LOT of time in the back....hiding. This would be ok if we could get our own drinks, but when you depend on a server to bring you a drink and your glass has been empty for 1/2 hour...not so much. \n\nThe best part about Souper Salad is the price. The \""other\"" salad bar is almost $10 per person and that is just insane for salad. The \""not so much\"" parts about Souper Salad are a bit more tolerable when the price is not an arm and a leg."
"2","Souper Salad always leaves you slightly dissatisfied. Not that I believe the competition is much better but there are some definite improvements that could push Souper Salad up a few notches. \n\n1. Clean plates and silverware. - we typically are left sorting through the stack of plates to look for one without cling on leftovers. This goes for silverware as well.\n\n2. More adequate staffing. - Every time we have gone to Souper Salad (which is quite often) we are forced to wait at the register for 2 - 10 minutes while the floor attendant carries drinks to seated patrons and removes dirty trays. There is one lady who has been working here forever with long brown hair. She seems to take on the majority of the workload. This last weekend there was what appeared to be a younger lady manager who seemed very uninterested in assisting at the register or anywhere else for that matter.\n\n3. Bread station refills - The bread is almost always empty or near empty forcing you to watch until bread is set out and then battle the other customers to get a lousy breadstick.\n\nI noticed that Souper Salad recently attempted a minor facelift. While under \""construction\"" the place looked a bit like a crime scene and I half expected a chalk outline on the floor. The big reveal did not do much to make up for the cosmetic disarray. There were maybe a few new pictures added (no more creepy dancing veggies) but I didnt notice many upgrades other than that. Regardless, you get what you pay for and considering you can feed a family of 3 for less than $20 you can't expect 5 star dining, but I won't be giving Souper Salad a 5 star rating either."
"4","= = = = = =  CLOSED!  = = = = = =\n\nSo sad, so sad...  we've lost yet another Souper Salad!     :-((     There were 16 of them in the Valley a while back & now we're down to THREE!  The problem?  THEY DON'T CHARGE ENOUGH FOR THE BUFFET!!  I certainly hope they'll finally see the light & raise the price a couple dollars at the remaining locations so we'll still have them around to enjoy!     :-O"
"4","Okay everyone, I've been doing business with these guys for a little over a year now and have done quite a bit of business with them. So you're probably asking why 4 stars and not 5? Well they don't deserve a 5. \n\nAs you read through the rest of these reviews, there's a person in this store with a little bit of an attitude. The old man and chuck are cool and willing to help, especially when you grow balls and start experimenting with new recipes or need help. \n\nI continue to go back because these 2 guys. I also like small business and the personal touch to that business. I am like some people on here though. I have tinkered with the idea of doing business online as I really don't like the snobbish attitude of the one guy that works there sometimes.\n\nOverall they normally have what you need.\n\nHope this helps."
"1","The cheapest, most tasteless mexican food I've ever had. Very greasy,\nhorrible cheese."
"4","Been in here more times than I can count.  Likely have a stake at this point in one of the boilers...\n\nThere is a rhythm to this place.  Like a hectic Starbucks (do these exist anymore?) or the DMV.  Bottom line is that It takes a few passes to get the swing of it.  Don't roll in all Einsteins-fresh and go \""hey, what about my microwave heated egg patty?!?!?\""\n\nGet to know this little gem and let them get to know you.  It's a dance people, it takes a few turns to get it.  After that, I believe you will experience a excellent value, consistency, and yes - friendly and helpful staff that I look forward to saying \""good morning\"" too.  \n\nBTW - one of the few places that will keep me drinking hot coffee in the summer due to their Kona!"
"5","Any type of fresh bagel and bagel sandwich you can think of. They are always fresh and use only boars head meats and cheeses. New York style deli that is simply delicious."
"5","This is a great place to sit and have lunch with friends.  It's always busy but the service is fast.  Staff is very friendly, in fact, my daughter of 2 years use to go in with me all the time and they would always acknowledge her.\n\nI never pay over $7 for breakfast or lunch, and the deli meat is excellent quality.  I would definitely recommend it."
"3","Superb bagel just wish they would cut back on the salt. Then I could patronize them more often."
"5","If you're craving for bagels or breakfast, you need to go here and eat every / any bagel you can think of."
"4","oOoh I'm giving this place four stars based solely on how fancy, organized and the quality of the produce and meats are...and they have this really lovely bakery inside...I would like to try it one day. As for the service...I am not very content with...why? because....\n\nSo I was at the Butcher Corner's section looking at the selections of great beef cuts...I was pretty happy they have Filet Mignon and they looked like pretty good quality...and well for $26/lb they should be! Well so I've been standing there for awhile and there was a person behind the counter...I knew that knew that I was there but he didn't say anything. Then another person (old white Caucasian male) walks around the area just browsing..automatically the butcher guy asks him if he needs help...when I have been standing there for like 2 minutes. I was a little offended. \n\nAnyways besides that...this place is the equivalent of Bristol Farms in LA. This market has all the exotic and fine ingredients to make a delicious meal. =)"
"2","I have been using this facility for several years.  The doctor's service has been fine, however the office has continually gotten worse.  When calling the office it is usually a minimum wait of 20 minutes.  Several times I have been disconnected.  I feel they need to get better or more office workers who appreciate a persons time."
"5","I have been going to Sakanas for years now, and can say that I have yet to have anything short of a great experience there! \n\nThe sushi is fantastic, very high quality and fresh! They give you huge pieces of fish for a very affordable price. The rolls ate delicious as well, they always have cool specials that can be seen on their whiteboard behind the sushi bar. The lunch special is fantastic, you can get plenty of rolls for very cheap! \n\nAlso, the service is always awesome. Yoshie, a manager, is always walking around greeting everyone and checking on you during your meal. She seems to know almost all her customers, and makes everyone feel important.\n\nI give them 5 starts for service, food quality, portion size, and prices, Sakanas is the best!!"
"5","We went here for lunch while on vacation.  The food was great and the portions were quite large.  3 of us at for $30 plus tip."
"3","I was a loyal Sakana fan for years up until the birth of my sone.  Going out for sushi is not so convenient with a lil one. So after a 3 year hiatus, my husband and I opted for Sakana on date night.  Would it be all that we remembered? Disappointed to say that it wasn't. We sat at the sushi bar and the chefs were not as personable as they were in the past - very little banter or recommendations. The saving grace was the scallop dynamite - the best I have had in the Valley and the oranges for dessert. Gosh how I missed those.  \nI accept that maybe a 3 year break might have built up my expectations."
"4","Pleasantly surprised here to say the least.  My local classmates brought me here since it was near our campus and when I saw sushi in a strip mall in the middle of the Arizona desert, I was skeptical.  But this place was the real deal on the inside and beyond offering standard fare, presented a number of interesting specials that really got my attention.  Lobster and Miso soup, soft-shell crab, spicy tuna handrolls and real, fresh wasabi made this place stand out.  I would go so far as to call it a sushi oasis in the desert!"
"3","Had some calamari tempura and a couple sushi rolls. Nothing was bad, but nothing was particularly memorable either. All of the staff was extremely pleasant."
"4","I really like that this place is always busy, but not busy enough for the staff to accommodate you. Every time I've eaten here I've gotten excellent service... and food! \n\nI've mostly tried their pasta dishes and haven't disappointed with any of them so far. If I'm on a (rare) healthy kick I'll order their flank steak salad, which is still awesome. Also love their Italian sodas - Hurricane is my fave. \n\nThis is my new place to go for Italian and a definite must-try!"
"1","I used to love this place. When it first opened (when it was half the size it was now, and they had BYOB because they didn't have an alcohol license), we really enjoyed it. The servers were friendly and fast, and the manager walked around and checked on all her guests.\n\nWhat the heck happened? This was my go-to spot during weekdays around lunch, when me and the girls would go in for their lunch special (a salad and pasta or pizza for $9). Slowly, this place was going from one of my favorite places, to somewhere I would avoid. There is no reason to have rude, ignorant waiters who know nothing about the new items they've added to their menu, or how to use a register. \n\nDespite this, because it's so close, me and a couple friends went in to get the lunch special. We were seated immediately in a cool area under an air vent (thank God) and our drink orders were taken as a server (a young blonde girl) introduced herself. It took six minutes for our drinks to get to the table, while we watched her chatting with a guy at the bar.\n\nWhen we took our orders, I got my usual. I love their Spring salad, I always get it every time I come in, because it's always delicious - and the pasta martini, which my whole family enjoys when we come in. Our food came out quick, and our bill came out shortly.\n\nHowver, when we had asked for a split bill, she must have forgotten. We had all gotten the same thing (the lunch special and a soda) so we gave her our debit cards so she could split them up at the register. She brought back our bills to sign and return our cards when I noticed my bill said $17?! Umm, no?! I immediately corrected her, and she told me she would remove that from my card and replace it with my bill. I left a small tip and left.\n\nThe next day, I went on to check my bank account. Not ONLY had I been charged the 17 for someone else's order, but the additional 13.50 from mine!!!  THIRTY DOLLARS?! I called the manager and she asked for my reciept. When I explained I did not have it (she hadn't brought me one), she told me she could not help me, even though I offered to print out my bank statement. \n\nI doubt I will ever come back to this location. I much prefer the location in uptown, where the servers are friendly and out of high school."
"4","Best creamy chicken pesto pasta I have had in a while.  Steak and pesto is also an option.  Great atmosphere and lighting.  Fast service and bread is to die for.  A nice Italian eatery in a Safeway shopping center."
"3","It's hard to get pasta wrong. Its also hard to stick out. Babbo does neither. A distinctly average yet affordable dining option located north of the 101 loop. They have lunch specials and decent pizza and wine."
"1","Went early tonight, Wed., to beat the crowd but we beat the main cook. Salad was wilted, main course lacked flavor other than the taste of the scorched vegetables. Our previous visit was just ok but this was our last visit."
"1","Incredibly rude service from Andrea on Sept. 13. Clearly annoyed I was\n\""interrupting her\"" to make my purchase. I will not use this location ever again."
"1","Worst store I've ever been to. They never have anything in stock, they refuse to honor discounts, and they have the rudest staff I've ever encountered. Hope this place goes out of business."
"5","Groomingdales is a wonderful local grooming store for your pet. Robin and Sean the owners are genuine people who care about animals and will treat your pet as if it is their own. I love the environment that the animal is not kept in a cage and can have free reign of the shop while they are waiting for their turn at grooming. I also took my Chloe (yorkie) in for daycare yesterday and when I picked her up at the end of the day, she was good and tired from having a fun filled day. Stop in and chat with Robin or Sean and get to know them, you won't regret it. Lastly - their address for their shop has moved, the Yelp administrator hasn't approved the address change - they are now located on 17224 N. 43rd avenue. Less than a mile from their previous location, just right over on 43rd, just North of Bell on the west side."
"2","I went to this cleaners for alteration to a gown. They told me they would alter the hem of the gown for $10-15, which I thought was a great deal because I had just been quoted $30. I left the dress and was told it would be ready by Thursday (I needed it for an event that day). I was called on Wednesday saying the cost was actually about $50, and would not be ready until Friday. I asked for the dress back but the dress was at a different location and they could not have it back to me. My plan was to take it to another location to get hemmed. Given the short amount of time, I ended up having them alter the gown although it was expensive. I ended up wearing a different gown since, although it was ready by Thursday, it was too late and I couldn't pick it up. The manager only gave me a 10%-15%. As good business practice, she should have given me the original price I was quoted.  At the end of it all, I ended up paying more (about $48), and the hem on the gown was done sloppily and the material now has a permanent wave at the base of the dress (probably because if the thread and tension used). It is an expensive and fancy gown, so I was pretty bummed they did a sloppy job. The positive: the two ladies I worked with were nice and professional."
"1","I found this place when I purchased a deal chicken.  It was 5mins from my house and I was excited to try a new place.  I called to make the appt. and the girl was super nice and accommodating for my schedule.  I needed to get the gel mani and pedi done within an hour and a half.  She said no problem.  I was getting married that weekend and this was for the event.  I showed up on time and was told the original person I had the appt with wasn't there.  No problem I figured no biggie.  Boy was I wrong.  The lady who was my replacement was a hairdresser NOT a nail tech.  She had zero experience.  She was already doing someones hair and I ended up waiting 20mins before she started on my toes.  What a disaster.  She was slow and inexperienced and I think my 7yo son could have done a better job painting them.  By this time I was seriously running low on time so I just told her to do a reg mani and skip the gel (which was the whole point of me going in the first place!).  Not to mention they didn't have red in the gel which seems like a common enough color to have in stock.  I ended up going home and painting my own nails since I have a gel kit at home, thank goodness.  By the next day, I noticed that the toe polish was chipping and peeling off and was also goopy looking like the polish was old.  Very disappointing.  Needless to say I wasted my money.  Will NEVER come back here."
"2","I have been a patient of Arizona Family Care, with a primary care physician of Dr. Heidi Bannister, since - well, to be honest, I don't remember. Since before 2006 for sure. Dr. Bannister has always been friendly and attentive, with a caring demeanor. In fact when I changed jobs in early 2006 and found that my new insurance did not cover her, I was rather upset - and very happy when I found that my new employer's insurance (in 2007) covered her. \n\nTo put it another way: I live near the northern intersection of the I-17 and the 101. This office is Glendale, just off the 101 on Union Hills. It's easily a 15 minute drive to the office, and there are plenty of doctors nearer to where I live.\n\nYou may then question why I have given her office a two-star review.\n\nIn December I had an appointment with Dr. Bannister, as a follow-up for a head cold and eye problems that I was having. She asked that I schedule a follow-up appointment for a month out, so I stopped and scheduled one for mid-January.\n\nI received the reminder call the Friday before the appointment, and realized that I had forgotten to ask for the time off work, so I would not be able to make the visit. Fully intending to call, I wound up with a number of critical issues dumped on me toward the end of the day, and it slipped my mind. I did not think of it again until Monday morning, when I noticed the reminder card on my desk. By that time the appointment was well-past, so I decided I would simply go ahead and wait until the next time I needed to go in for refills or whatnot.\n\nA few days later I received a letter from the doctor's office. I figured it was a reminder that I had missed the appointment. To my surprise, I opened it to find a letter from the office, signed by the doctor, that they were dropping me as a patient. The reasoning?\n\nThree missed appointments - one in 2007, another last year, and then the one a few days ago (Jan 2012).\n\nNow, don't get me wrong, I understand that missed appointments can lose an office money and cause issues for other patients. However:\n\n1. The doctor NEVER mentioned to me in any of the intervening appointments I had in 2011 and this last appointment that this was their policy, nor is it mentioned in any of their documentation (I just went to their website and double-checked).\n\n2. In every case that I had a missed appointment, I was charged a $25 missed appointment fee - in two of the cases, $5 more than my insurance co-pay (which I understand is only partial compensation since the visit is actually far more than that) that I paid.\n\n3. In one of those cases (the appointment in 2010) I actually DID call the office the evening before to cancel, but because of voice mail problems I was unable to leave a message. I paid the $25 missed fee anyway the next time I went in, because I liked the doctor's office and didn't want to make a fuss.\n\nFor whatever reason the impersonality of the letter bothered me. My first thought was to call the office but to be honest it's too much of a hassle; there was no diplomacy here, so if they do not want me as a customer, I do not want them.\n\nI would suggest to the office that they include this policy on their paperwork, and to call 48 hours before an appointment instead of the day before (when they require 24-hours' notice of cancellation).\n\nKeep this in mind the next time you visit the doctor; apparently the friendly relationship you perceive with your doctor only lasts until you've inconvenienced them a handful of times over the course of 5 years; then you're out the door."
"1","Wow. If you want to buy something here, be prepared to be assaulted if you don't want add-ons. I can't believe the change of attitude in our salesman when we said we didn't need cables, and did not want their warranty. The \""sales manager\"" came over, (who was younger than the salesperson--I'm not buying the \""manager\"" thing) and tried to sell us also. We left without buying anything. When they mention Monster Cable, RUN!"
"3","Went through the drive-thru today-- got my friends the cod sandwich. Several hours later, one friend had digestive problems. I've gone there before without incident, but i'd double check to make sure the food is cooked enough. Perhaps nuke it for a minute in the microwave at home to be safe."
"1","Don't bother if you care about customer service. One stylist for the entire place resulted in two walkouts in 20 minutes. Amateur hour."
"5","I am a self proclaimed \""Trader Joe Hoe\"" lol. I don't care what anyone says, Trader Joes is the BEST grocery store EVER. The Arrowhead location is one of the best, I don't see why people are bitching about it. I shop at this location on a weekly basis and sure, sometimes it's a bit crowded but it's nothing unusual from Walmart, Fry's ect. I've been a Trader Joeaholic since my days in Los Angeles. The store locations are very limited in Phoenix, but I'm just so grateful they even have stores out here! Trader Joes carries so many foodie friendly products, no other grocery store can compare. A few of my top TJ products are..\nTrader Joes Meditteranian Hummus\nTrader Joes Dolmas (they even beat restaurant dolmas!!)\nTrader Joes Guacamole\nTrader Joes Dark Chocolate Covered Cranberries\nAnd the list can go on and on. Trader Joes carries a lot of vegetarian products as well which is pretty nice. And for everyone taking stars away from this remarkable place due to the fact that it's not near or in your darn backyard,  go take a hike to the nearest preservative packed Walmart and load up on pork grinds or something sheesh.. Trader Joes also has a raffle if you bring a reuseable bag when you shop. They always have had many lanes open when I go and the wait is never long enough for me to remember it being long. The cashiers are always really friendly. I love Trader Joes!! Always and forever!! 5 stars baby!! :)"
"4","Definitely one of my favorite grocery stores. Tons of vegetarian & vegan options. Lots of whole food based items. Lots of items focused on using healthy ingredients. They make lots of their own brand products, many of which are VERY good and delicious. We love their hummus.\n\nThe only reason I give 4 stars instead of 5 is that I can't always find every single item that I need there, as Trader Joe's is a smaller grocery store than most. This applies to their produce section as well, as I can't find a certain vegetable or other item I'm looking for there occasionally. Wish the store was even bigger and offered even more so that I could do all of my shopping there."
"4","So now that I've been here multiple times, I must say that the rude worker was probably having an off day. Every time I've been in here everyone has been super helpful, it's always clean & everyone is friendly. LOVE TJ's!!"
"3","I have been here a total of three times, and each time I come I have tried something new hoping to find something that tasted good. Perhaps it is the fact that I haven't tried any good ones or perhaps its the fact that I have just been trying all the bad ones. Either or they are one in the same because every time I have come here I have been disappointed. Here is the break down of the stars given.\n\nStar 1:\nThe Service: I gave this a star because despite the drinks here being bland the people working here are absolutely not in the slightest. They have always been courteous and full of smiles. They are always prompt with making my drinks and very friendly.\n\nStar 2:\nThe Atmosphere: This place is a wonderful place to be whether you came to chat with your friends, study, or just read a book. There is no pressure to leave and there are many different types of seats in this place. A comfortable couch to read on, a sturdy chair to study in, or outside patio chairs for the cool evenings. \n\nStar 3:\nThe Location: Being next to the 101 freeway is always a plus due to easy travel. I can easily go from work to this place and then back home. All I have in my area is a dunkin doughnuts and to be honest you don't go their for lattes.\n\nOn the flip side, here are why the other two stars were not given.\n\n1: The drinks: As I mentioned before I was sorely disappointed with the drinks here. My first drink here was the Carmel latte and to be honest I thought I was going to get a blood clot because of how sweet it was. It was so sweet that I only could take a couple sips and then had to throw it away. My second drink was some type of ice tea. I love ice tea, but when I drank this it was so bitter I had to force myself to drink it all just to feel that I didn't waste my money. Finally, the last drink i got was the Chai Tea Latte. All I can say is that it tasted like a Chai Tea Latte that sat out in the sun for about 10 minutes and served. It was so watered down and unpleasant I just drank it as fast as I could and left it at that. \n\n2: The prices. When I look at the cost of some of these things I find myself a little in awe. How could such simple concoctions of sugar, power, coffee, and milk be so expensive? My chai tea was almost $5 with tax and it was tiny!\n\nDespite the disappointing drinks I think i keep coming back because of the atmosphere of the place. Hopefully I can find something to drink soon that is good, or I might have to start looking for another coffee shop. After all isn't the main reason you go to a coffee shop is to drink coffee or related drinks?"
"4","I love the furniture here! We went in looking for a coffee table and a large ottoman.  Pricey but all of the pieces are unique. Place was not busy and sales people did not circle you like road kill. They also didnt say hello, so I took a star. We were able to browse through and didnt have any questions so it didn't bother me that they didnt greet us. Large and small pieces to go in any room. Looked like they had a design center. Didn't find the perfect piece today."
"3","The sushi rolls are kinda thin. I heard a lot of good things about this place. I only found it to be ok. I was not that impressed. I'd go again but it wouldn't be my first choice."
"3","For the price, Hungry Howie's is all right. I like the choice of crust flavors, and the coupon deals are reasonable. The Howie's bread is super salty, but otherwise it's the way I like it--crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. I ordered a pineapple pizza, and there wasn't much cheese. Otherwise, it tasted good. \n\nI would say this is a step above Little Cesar's."
"1","No stars! Walk to the restroom and see the salsa and so called bean dip sitting on the counter with the dirty dishes and other cleaning equipment. I should have left then. Seriously on the cusp of calling the health dept on them."
"4","We love going to this restaurant for lunch or dinner.  The chips, margaritas and food are Deliciouso'"
"1","Was a big fan until yesterday. Hot sauce used to be the best, now just tasted like tomato sauce. Food was awful, they're only excuse was that they are training new chefs. Sadly, we will not go back."
"1","I'm not surprised by the reviews and wished I would have read them before going.  What I am surprised about is how many negative reviews there are going back several years and the same problems remain...hello?\n\nThis was our first and last visit.  There's no \""Steak House\"" apeal at all.  It more resembles a nursing home.  Not only the cliental but the decor as well.  Even when the phone rings, it seems to be amplified so everyone has an opportunity to hear it.  Management seemed very out of touch not only with the guests but the employees as well.  \n\nThe portions on the sides were very small and the 16 oz Ribeye I had ordered medium rare...half, yes half of the steak they praise was medium well and the other half was RARE, very very rare.  They forgot to bring out my mashed potatoes and once they did after I said something they were very dry.  Everything I had lacked flavor and care.  I could go on about the other 3 dishes my family had and didn't care for, however I really want to put this behind us. \n\nOnce a week my family and I try something new...we will not be back!"
"3","My first visit was decent, but didn't quite live up to my expectations.\n\nI food just wasn't that good for a steakhouse. Neither my wife and I cared for our appetizer. We got the Fire-Grilled Fresh Artichoke. They say it is a popular choice, but I didn't like it at all. My burger was very plain and lacked good taste. It made me wish I had gone to Five Guys instead. My wife got the steak and thought it was OK, but later she ended up getting sick. She ordered off the gluten-free menu as she has sensitivities, so this place may have issues with cross-contamination.\n\nOne positive was our friendly server. Cassie was excellent and we were very pleased because we rarely get good service when we go out. She kept up with refills and offered to replace anything we didn't like. I also wrote about my visit and explained how I didn't like the food. The manager said he would send us a coupon, so I can appreciate that they are reaching out to their customers.\n\nI got good vibes from sitting at the restaurant. I like their tables and seats. I think I will give it a second chance, but the food has to be better if they want to win me over as a customer."
"3","After being seated at three different tables we decided to sit at the bar.  We then found out they were out of lager.  How the hell can a brewery be out of lager?  The food was decent, the service was below average, and the crowd was the usual here in Glendale, old white folks."
"2","Eh. \n\nThey're open until 2am.  That's about the only above average thing they have going for them in NW Phoenix.  Probably the weakest Rock Bottom I've visited.  \n\nEverything is average or below average.  The prices are too high for what you get unless you hit happy hour.  With Yard House setting the bar in this genre, this place just looks weak.\n\nFood quality ranks at bar food to me.  Servers don't seem to be paid or managed well.  Upgrades are needed all around."
"4","Huge selection of beers.. Ambiance is also great.. food is awesome....try the chicken nachos...just awesome !"
"4","I really like shopping here.  The clearance racks have some great finds at decent prices.  It is the only section I would buy from (well other than the skin care counters) though, cuz prices are steep in my opinion everywhere else in the store."
"1","I work a Arrowhead in a smaller store so before work I decided to go shopping. I've been looking for a new watch and purse since I already got my taxes back. I went to the Michael Kors watch counter and the sales lady was helping some woman who said she was looking around, the woman was flashing hundred dollar bills in her hand, so I looked around. When that woman left, she completely ignored me and started doing paperwork even though I made eye contact with her and said hello. I'm only 18 and I look very young so I'm often passed by sales people because they don't think they'll get a sale.  well, I was going to give you a $300 dollar sale but I guess not now, people should stop judging by my age.\n\nAfter the stupid watch sales lady, I went to go look at some handbags. Where again, no one helped me even after I said hello and expressed interest. Step up your game, Dillard's. I, myself, am a sales associate and I know when someone is interested in making a purchase.\n\nThe atmosphere of this Dillard's is just crap now. I saw two beauty counter associates talking about an older Asian lady because she couldn't speak English and they couldn't understand her. They were laughing and ignoring her.\n\nThe amount of booger picking kids running a muck here is mind boggling. Watch your damn kids."
"4","It's a maze of toys that you won't find at most department stores. \n\nI like the organization. It makes it easy to go the the area you want. All toys in their proper spot, divided into Toddler toys, board games, stuffed animals, learning toys, dolls, sports toys, action figured, cars, etc. \n\nI was serious about the maze thing, lol. There is 1 entrance and 1 exit and they are not interchangeable :) When you first walk in, because they know children so well and their ability to walk in a door and then break out into an all out sprint in all directions, you are guided through a few isles that curve around (they are chalk full of toys, of course) and THEN you get to the main isle. \n\nMy check out experience was awesome. The lady actually noticed that I was hiding something my nieces view and she made sure to scan it when she wasn't looking and to double bag it :D I love her. \n\nPrices range, but the toys here do seem to be pricier in general compared to most department stores, but like it said, they have a much wider variety."
"1","I would not go to them ever again. We have twin 18 month olds. they missed so many opportunities for candid pictures because they were so concerned with getting the one perfect picture. they also were way behind in appointments which made that window of opportunity with toddlers dwindle quickly because they under-staff and overbook. after an hour we were presented with 6 horrible shots. also their prices are insane. I highly recommend going to Pictureme studios instead. they are better priced and do an amazing job."
"2","service is ok.\nfood is ok...actually really bland and plain. I had the blackened salmon and my parents had the roasted turkey breast.\nchamomile tea is the best.\n\ngood luck."
"2",":( The service was fast. We ordered (2) meals. The Bouillabaisse seafood soup and the Bavette Steak with Brussels sprouts. The french onion soup was excellent. The soup was ok; it would have been nice to see some seafood in it for it was little. The Bavette Steak was awful. There were (5) strips of tough meat and the sprouts were burned; maybe they were trying cajun. Don't know, but it wasn't worth $17.50 :("
"3","Good, small portions. Pricey for simple foods. Nice environment."
"1","This Mimi's is the worst. The vibe is as if they are a restaurant in training. My server was nice but slightly flustered.\n\nI ordered the benedict with bacon and tomatoes. When you look at the picture on how it was served it was sloppy and made with no care. Mimi's has always given some presentation but this was food on a plate.\n\nIt looked a mess and then I put my fork in it had egg shells inside. I said to my family I knew this dish looked off when it arrived and now egg shells.\n\nI told my server and she was great about getting me something else and apologizing. So I ordered my next usual the Quiche Lorraine taste great but once again thrown on a plate. Typically its served on lettuce with fruit on a plate. This was not the case.\n\nLow Fat Blueberry muffin was great as always..\n\nThis location just didn't feel welcoming and the experience was subpar, management they need help."
"1","Have been to this Boston Market with Friend's on 5 Different Occasion's and everytime we go there. All of our Side Order's are alway's COLD.\n\nCold Mashed Potatoe's, Cold Stuffing, etc, etc. And they serve you very, very Small Piece's of Chicken for the Price that they charge you. \n-$7.50 with Tax.\n\nIt's not worth it.\n\nI have to admit the Food look's very seasoned and moist. \nBut it's ALWAY'S COLD.\n\nAnd they give you.....Small Piece's of Chicken. \n\nSorry Gang, Save Your Money and Go Somewhere Else. \nToo Expensive for Small Piece's of Chicken and COLD FOOD."
"4","oOoh been here once for dinner and about three times for lunch...it's really a great place for a quick and easy meal and it's not too fatty like other fast foods..and it's pretty cheap. \n\nI love their 3 piece dark meat rotisserie chicken that comes with a delicious cornbread (I'm usually not fond of cornbread) and two choices of sides. I've had the creamed spinach, corn, veggie mix, squash mix, roasted herb red potatoes and sweet yam which is my least favorite....the sweet yam casserole is just too sweet for my taste...so not a big fan of that one..other than that the other sides are pretty good. The meatloaf meal is also really good...two really good size slice of meatloaf also with a choice of two sides and a cornbread...2 bucks more expensive than the chicken but sometimes you want something besides chicken. heh\n\nSo for a quick easy cheap semi-healthy meal that does not consist of a hand full of grease (burgers, pizza, tacos of that sort..) then Boston Market is really a fantastic choice =)\n\nYummers!"
"1","Rude & uninformed staff.   Sales girl did not know what an insurance appraisal was."
"3","I had a lunch here not long ago, but it was nothing exciting. It wasn't even the best Old Country Buffet I have visited. The food was very basic and it was hard for me to find things that I really enjoyed. Because of that I decided to eat healthier options that I don't fix on my own, so I suppose that was good in a way. I would say its a good place to go if you are looking for home cooked type foods, but don't want to cook yourself. Just keep in mind that you won't find food that is overly tasty, if at all, here."
"2","The food isn't all that great and the Mac n cheese taste like that cheap powder cheese and the staff act like they where scared to come serve us maybe because of our skin color. The place wasn't very impressive I won't be back. I tried it once that's it."
"3","It usually happens like this: I'm driving, on my way home. I call husband and ask what he wants for dinner. After several minutes of indecisive bantering back and forth, he says \""wings?\"" I say \""sure, from where?\"" He says \""Brothers?\"" I say \""sure, call it in.\"" Haven't had the pizza in quite a while, but it was alright. Obviously not fantastic, or I would remember that. And not disgusting, or I would remember that as well. They have a decent menu full of other Italian dishes and sandwiches. Not the best most awesome wings, but it's the closest and on my route home. Staff is friendly and the place is clean!"
"1","Place is a joke. Screwed up drive-thru order, food is disgusting, hard, dry. Wont answer phone. Calling MasterCard to do a chargeback."
"5","They have good food. Been eating here since I moved down 10 years ago. I like their toasted subs and the pizza is excellant! My husband likes the wings and bread knots. Happy Hour is also a bonus.\n\n They are Phoenix Suns sponsors and host the Gorillla during the season. My kids loved eating thier gluten free pizza and meeting the famous Suns Gorilla! Very relaxed family friendly atmosphere. Always welocoming you with a smile when you enter."
"2","It has been about 6 years since we dined at streets of New York. This time we ordered a thin and crispy pizza, a Caesar salad and bread knots. From my memory the pizza was better than I remember but not great.   However, the salad was not edible in fact we took it back.  The romain was brown and at least 4 or five days past it's prime.   They took it back without any Question and comped us a piece cheesecake in good faith.  Who ever prepared our meal should be totally embarrassed....        I don't think we will go back.."
"4","This place gets a 4.5 Stars!\n\nI played on these fields twice for softball tournaments. One was for the ASA softball Worlds that they hosted and the other was most recently the ASA Hispanic Worlds Tournament. Both experiences have been great. Several well kept softball fields, sand volleyball courts, batting cages and bar/lounge area were one can have accessibility to watch the games. It seems to have ample parking lot, so I don't think parking will be a problem.\n\nI believe there is an entrance fee of $3.00 dollars. At Big League Dreams they charge $3.00 for entrance fee, but they give you a free drink token as well. I don't recall Victory Lane doing that.\n\nOverall great park and environment! A great sports venue!!!"
"4","This is a great complex that offers enough shade to keep you from getting too much sun, misters to keep you cool (if wanted to step in the direction of!) A bar/grill that isn't anything great BUT nice having the choice of having a little better selection of food other than game food; hotdog, pretzel, soda, ect..  I like the layout, I LOVE the future plan of a field for the disabled children (so so neat), and I liked the cleanliness of the bathrooms/complex.... MINUS the no clean at all bar area. Everything about being up on the deck/in the bar was very dirty. First off a dead baby bird on the deck (REALLY?! EWW) and the doors/everything you touch having horrible horrible amounts of dirty finger prints/sweat caked on. Yes, I understand it was a busy day for softball but a little touching up throughout the day...... Not hard."
"4","This Domino's is on point. I hate to admit it, but we order from these guys a lot and they are always quick, accurate and friendly. The first time we ordered from here when we first moved to Phoenix wasn't that great because they couldn't confirm our address was a house and we had to call to see where our food was. They eventually delivered it... cold. BUT I don't know if they have a new manager or not. They got there stuff together and I'm completely satisfied with them."
"1","Classic bait and switch. Called for an appointment  for a simple oil change with my own \""High End\"" Synthetic oil and K&N filter. Was quoted a certain price. Sent my wife in for appointment and the price jumped dramatically. Again... another case of a \""repair shop\"" taking advantage of a woman. Unfortunate because they are a neighborhood service dealer. \nDO NOT send a woman in by herself. In speaking with friends and neighbors, this seems to be a typical action by these people."
"5","One evening on the way back from Sedona I stopped here for some pie and a coffee.  It was about 50min before closing but followed a few other last minute \""pie-goers\"" in the door.  \n\nCute and cozy old western interior.  Cracker Barrel-esque, warm and inviting.  \n\nI spot on the menu RHUBARB CRUB PIE!!! I can't believe my eyes!!!!  My grandmother would always get rhubarb pie from a local farmers market.  I have been on a search for good rhubarb for a long time.  Let me tell you it was LOVE AT FIRST BITE!!!!  \n\nTheir pie crust is out of this world!!!  The crumb topping, TO DIE FOR!!!   \nI have had my fair share of pie and this TAKES THE CAKE!  \n\nHere is the pie list:\n\n-Apple \n-Apple Crumb\n-Banana Cream\n-Blackberry\n-Blueberry\n-Blueberry Crumb\n-Cherry\n-Cherry Crumb\n-Chocolate Cream\n-Coconut Cream\nJack Daniels Pecan \n-Lemon Meringue \n-Mixed Berry Crumb\n-Peach\n-Peach Crumb\n-Pecan\n-Pumpkin \n-Rhubarb \n-Rhubarb Crumb\n-Tennessee Lemon Pie\n\nThey have coolers filled with whole pies and slices to go.  Well worth the trip and you will be coming back for more!"
"1","Stopped on the way to Payson.\n\nI was hoping for a good traditional down-home breakfast. What I got was denny's quality"
"3","This is an odd duckling in the middle of basically nowhere. It was shockingly crowded and I think it must be very well-known by locals (their sign says \""World Famous Pies\""). We had to wait about 20 minutes to get a table around 2 on a Sunday but there's a store so we sort of wandered around and inhaled the aroma of fresh-baked pies while looking at cowboy kitsch. The poor hostess seems nice but she is woefully incompetent and got flustered easily when more than one person was waiting in line to get their name on the list. She had a heck of a time finding people, couldn't keep people straight on the list, etc., but was very nice.\n\nThat being said, I have to wonder about how this place seats people. The party behind us was a party of 5. They seated us at a table for 6 and there were only two of us but we came in before the party of 5 who was told they  might have to wait almost 45 minutes. Ok, that's fine. We were the youngest ones in the place by about 20 years which was a bit awkward. \n\nThe young man who brought us our water was very nice. The waitress was not and was very brusk, impatient and uninterested. The food was pretty decent for a roadside joint. My husband had the pulled pork reuben which was really good in the first half, but average in the second. I think only half the ingredients made it onto the second half of the sandwich. I had their chicken and biscuits which is basically a deconstructed pot pie and was very good. Awful for me, but really, really good. The biscuits were flaky and fresh-tasting. We split a piece of their Jack Daniel's Pecan Pie and you could definitely taste the whiskey. It was very good and the piece was perfect to share. Price was decent. \n\nSo food was pretty good but service was....lacking. It was a nice little stop overall on the way home from Sedona but I probably wouldn't stop again."
"4","They have great hours... open til 9 on the weekdays i believe, and I'm sure even later on the weekends. We were able to end our day with a drive out there, and made it just before close. They did have a diner where you could eat, but passed. Although it was very quaint, the reviews on food were mediocre. But, people were raving about the pies. They still had a great selection,tons of pies to choose from, even though it was the end of the day. We bought a whole pie, which are a little pricey, but well worth it, for the 2 of us to share. It did not last long! Plus a sticky bun, and another one piece of pie (which is nice when you cant choose) We were so disappointed at the thought of not being able to bring some home for our friends and family to try- so it will be a top recommendation to anyone we know going to visit the phoenix area. Although you could get them shipped, the shipping is astronomical, but at least will give us something to look forward to when on vacation in Arizona. The gift shop was also fun to look around in, lots of nicknack's and touristy souvenirs. Cant wait to visit again!"
"1","***My first review anywhere about anything***\nFor years, I've been hearing about these legendary pies...so, on a recent trip to the Grand Canyon, my wife and I made a point to finally stop @ Rock Springs Cafe for lunch.\nWe arrived well after the lunch rush, so there were plenty of seats available, and the restaurant appeared well-staffed.\nWe were seated quickly...I did my best to glance at the dishes in front of diners we passed along the way to see if anything looked particularly enticing...I noticed that several plates had uneaten, limp and soggy looking fries, so I made a mental note to avoid them.\n\n3 people offered to take our drink order within mere seconds...which I interpreted to be a sign of good things to come...but, boy, was I wrong. \n\nWe asked our server for recommendations, and she struggled to come up with suggestions.  The menu has a half-dozen or so items marked as \""House Specialties\"" (or something like that)...among them, is Chicken Fried Steak, which our server recommended as well...so I order that with mashed potatoes.\n\nOur Order:\nChili - My wife liked it\nClam Chowder - I'd bet $1000 it was from a can.  Artificially thick with scant (and very chewy) clams.\nChicken Fried Steak - Had an oddly uniform shape and thickness...I told the server that it was \""horrible\"" and asked if it was was prepared on site or frozen.  She admitted that they bought it already prepared and frozen and just heated it up.  She further stated that the previous owner had made it fresh, but that the new owners considered this \""good enough.\""  When I exclaimed that for $10.95 I could have bought the same garbage at Costco and made my own, she agreed.  I didn't finish the steak...and the gravy (like the chowder) was artificially weighty and almost certainly also from a can.\nMashed Potatoes - Not so much \""mashed\"" as \""smashed\"" and served with an ice cream scoop.  This may have been satisfactory, were it not for the grape-sized black chunk of rotten potato in my second bite.\n\nNobody ever noticed when our drinks needed to be refilled...I finally asked a different server for a refill.\n\nAt one point, I noticed that the pick up/service window was overflowing with plates ready to be served while waitstaff stood nearby, chatting, apparently oblivious to the food that was ready to be served.  (Well, at least \""intended\"" to be served...because most of what we saw was never \""ready\"").\n\nOur check arrived while we were eating our pie.  There was no consideration for the fact that we had complained about the food quality and not finished our plates.\n\nI don't remember what kind of pie we ordered...really...and, while I have no complaints about it, but it was certainly unspectacular.\n\n...then, we hit the road bound for Williams, AZ where we had an even less-stellar meal at the Grand Canyon Railroad Cafe...but, that's another story."
"3","My best friend and some our assorted kidlets ate here last night on our way back down from Flagstaff, where we were picking up the two oldest kidlets from NAU.\n\nWe pulled in at 8:40 and it looked almost deserted, there were only about 2 cars in the parking lot...  Being afraid they'd already closed, I checked the hours on the door; it said it was open to 10PM, perfect.  We walk in, seat ourselves (per the sign).  The wooden highchair we found for my toddler was missing the safety belts and was more wobbly than a 50 year old Bangladesh high-rise in a category 4 typhoon.  Seriously, I wasn't even sure it was totally safe, but we didn't see another option so I kept her at arm's length just in case it started to lean dangerously as she wiggled in it.  Thankfully it held up okay, but it doesn't have too many more days ahead of it before it's fire kindling...  \n\nRight away a hostess came over and offered us menus and takes our drink orders: 4 waters and a Dr. Pepper.  The waitress was there just a couple minutes later to get our dinner orders and unfortunately, one of the teenagers had just wandered away 30 seconds beforehand, so we had to ask her to come back in a second to get all of our orders.  Well, nearly 10 minutes later she returned and got all of our orders.   Also, while she was gone I noted that the floor was filthy.  Really, I'm cool with rustic concrete floors, but throughout the day someone needs to be sweeping the floor.  This floor didn't look like it had been swept ALL day long with crumpled napkins, bits of smashed food, straw wrappers, crumbs, etc.  \n\nI ordered the mac and cheese dinner entree, with vegetables in lieu of potato side and a side salad.  My side salad was served right away and was crisp and fresh.  Very tasty.  Interestingly, they serve it with diced cucumber and tomatoes, which was different, but very tasty.  I think I liked it better that way compared to how most places serve it.\n\nThe mac and cheese arrived a few minutes later and while it looked delicious with a perfectly browned bread crumb topping and gooey, stringy cheesey deliciousness, and perfect al dente macaroni noodles, it was totally and utterly tasteless.  I honestly think the kitchen made it without any seasoning at all.  Now, I'm no gourmand, but I've made some home style mac and cheese in my day and there are certain things (aside from salt and pepper) you can add to give it some zing, like onion, garlic, nutmeg, mustard powder, paprika, etc..  I don't think this mac and cheese even saw salt and pepper, let alone ANY of the more complex seasonings.  Sad.  I was really enticed, because it looked so good on the surface, but it was a utter taste-flop.  My 17 month old daughter wouldn't even eat it.  Additionally, the side dish they served it with was canned peas with a couple of random pieces of carrots.  Yuck.   Note to the kitchen: canned peas are virtually inedible gray-green little balls of mush; please at least use frozen peas, they are so much better tasting and looking and practically the same price.\n\nMy best friend said her Cobb Salad with grilled chicken was the best she ever had, and she knows from salads.\n\nThe other kids ate their food without complaint, except my 15 year old nephew, who also received a side of canned peas with his dinner.  He refused to touch them and made jokes threatening to throw them, one by one, at his older sister.  Ah, the joys of older children...  ;)\n\n\nAnyway, my friend and I shared a piece of Jack Daniels Pecan Pie.  That was superb.  And really, as most of us already know, pie is what Rock Springs Cafe is known for throughout the State, right??\n\nOur bill for 5 1/2 (2 adults, 3 teens and a baby) was about $66.  We paid it, and sadly we literally weren't quite to our car in the parking lot when they turned off the lights and closed the place down.  Weird.  It wasn't even 9:20 yet."
"1","Breakfast is all pre-cooked.  Ham boiled.  Ordered bacon well but it comes however it is cooked prior.  No special orders here.  Not that cheap either.  Just fast, that's all!"
"1","If you're in search of food, keep driving.  \nIf you're in search of pie, drive to the Pie Hole in Phoenix.  \n\nI used to go to Rock Springs Cafe on a monthly basis with my grandparents when I was younger.  That was our thing - taking a Sunday drive and stopping by RSC on our way back home to grab food and a piece of  \""Penny's Pies\"".   Penny was the gal that used to make all the pies in Black Canyon City.  I learned while we were waiting for our table that there are new owners, and oh my how things have changed.  From the appearance and layout to more importantly - the quality of the food.   \n\nKeep on drivin' if you're hungry and in this neck of the woods.  J, Baby C, and I stopped by Rock Springs to get an early supper on Sunday after a day trip up north.  I told him about how good the pies were and the food was in general.  He was on board when it came time to figure out what we were doing for supper.   \n\nJ ordered the meatloaf dinner and I ordered the chicken.  Our plan was to feed Baby C off of both our plates.  Good idea in theory.  When we ordered, I stated I wanted a baked potato (which was on the menu) and the gal said that they don't serve baked potatoes until after 5pm.  Ummm...Its Sunday and a holiday weekend.  If one was going to sell a baked potato, 4pm on a Sunday would be the right time.  No where on the menu did it state that baked potatoes weren't available until after 5pm.  \n\nJ gets the soup (chowder) and I get a side salad.  You really cant screw up either of those.  J said his soup was pretty good.  \n\nOur dinner comes out a few minutes later.  We were shocked to say the least.  We both dig in and J immediately is repulsed.  His meatloaf was lukewarm, greasy, and the gravy on top was congealed.  GAG.  My chicken was more like a Cornish game hen.  See photo for the worlds smallest chicken leg.  It looked more like a drumette, you know, the kind you'd get with an order of chicken wings.  The vegetables that came with out dinners, a half ear of waterlogged field corn.  An ear of corn (a bad ear at that) hardly constitutes as \""vegetables\"".  I was thinking we'd get green beans, peas, carrots, or something.  \n\nThe waitress came by and saw J was not pleased.  So she took his plate and asked if he wanted anything else. I told him to skip the regular food and to just get a piece of pie.  If he was hungry, we could get him something at the outlets in Anthem (which was where we were stopping by on our way home).  J liked this idea and ordered a slice of banana cream pie.  \n\nWhen the pie came out, he took a few bites and that was it.  He said it tasted like imitation banana and was not cold, but slightly warm.  I seriously doubt this was a true \""Penny's Pie\"".  More like a bad knockoff.    \n\nThe only positive thing out of the whole trip was the waitress took his dinner and pie off our bill, without us having to ask or talk to a manager.  \n\nWe stopped by the general store, but the guy there didn't seem interested in helping us.  Or at least helping me.  But yet he yacked it up with J for a minute.  When I walked over to the counter to try a sample he was pushing J, did he acknowledge me?  Nope.  So we left.\n\nAnd we wont be returning.  If we're out for a drive, and are in need of food...we'll drive to Anthem.  \n\nAnd - If you really want a GOOD (more like AWESOME) piece of homemade pie, go to The Pie Hole in Phoenix.  :)"
"2","We went out with the Central AZ Jeepers the other night to do a night run of the Maggie Mine Trail.  The plan was to start up at Bumble Bee, come south to Black Canyon City, then finish at Rock Springs Cafe for dinner and pie.\n\nFirst I have to mention we had a party of over 20 Jeeps and the trail is mostly visible from 17---we must have looked so cool, snaking along the mountain, our chair of headlights glowing in the night.  So if anyone took video...\n\nSo I was looking forward to Rock Springs Cafe.  We have driven past it a million times, but for one reason or another, never got the chance to stop in.  Finally!\n\nOur organizer, Cheri, had fixed it up with the Cafe that they were going to get invaded by 30-some Jeepers, so there was seating when we got there.  Parking, not so much.  They were having some sort of party at an outdoor venue down below---it looked fun.  Good music!\n\nWe were with DS and DSGF and they decided they were just going to hang out in the parking lot and listen to the music, because sometimes teenagers are weird.  But that put the kibbosh on a relaxing meal followed with pie, so I can't comment on the food.  But I insisted DH and I go in for some of that famous pie and coffee.\n\nIt took a bit to get some service, but we had walked in with thirty-odd people, so no dings for that.  The coffee was good!  Hot and fresh!  I ordered the coconut meringue pie and DH ordered the JD pecan pie.  My pie was a mile high, had a good coconut flavor but was a tad sweet for my taste.  But I don't like super-sweet stuff.  I tend to cut back on the required sugar when I make desserts.  But it was very good.  Someone commented in another review they thought the crust was store-bought.  Maybe.  DH liked his bite of my pie.\n\nI liked DH's pecan pie.  DH liked it, but he said mine is better.  (I make mine with chocolate chips and kahlua---go big or go home!)  \n\nIt took about 10 minutes to get our server's attention to get our check, which came to about $12 for two slices of pie and a cup of coffee.  She muttered something at us when she gave us the ticket---I didn't quite catch it.  So after about five minutes of sitting at the table waiting for her to come back, we took the ticket and cc and went to the gift shop to pay.  We stood there for several minutes waiting for someone and then a girl showed up and said: oh, no, you don't pay here, you have to pay your server.  (Oh, that must have been what the server was telling us!)  So we went back in to the counter and found our server.  She took our ticket and the cc, and then started messing around on the POS and I swear we stood there for ANOTHER seven or eight minutes while she entered some orders and helped another server with a question.  Then she took our money.  So, basically, we spent more time trying to pay our bill than eating our pie!  LOL!\n\nSo, it was an okay experience.  I'd probably go back if there was a group vote to do so, but I don't think DH and I would stop on our own volition.  I liked DH's pie better than mine and he liked mine better than his, but we both agreed that the cup of coffee we shared was very good.  Definitely, management could do a better job on customer service.  But you see a lot of this: management thinks they are \""saving money\"" by not having enough staff to take care of customers graciously and with efficiency, and then people stop coming because of the inadequate service.  Such is the way of the world!"
"5","Tennessee......Lemon Custard......Pie.......enough said. However I am sure there is a PIE choice you will find to your satisfaction as well at this SLICE of heaven in Rock Springs Arizona. Now for those of you not familiar with this location.....well you have truly missed out on one the WORLD's truly hidden gems when it comes to homemade PIES. There is a bar and cafe/restaurant along with a gift shop.....but the true prize here are the PIES. Now it can be quite a trek from the valley.....I live in the Paradise valley and it takes about 40 minutes to drive to Rock Springs. So with that being said I recommend only going if say your going to the Anthem Outlets on I-17 North or maybe heading up to Sedona.....Cottonwood.....Jerome....Clarksdale....Flagstaff area. You can't really miss it once you pass the Outlet mall however here is a very good tip just in case you do. It literally sits on the border between Maricopa County and Yavapai County.....if you pass the sign for Yavapai county and have not seen Rock Springs yet......you have probably gone to far.....just keep that in mind. Now go and get that PIE and remember to Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!!\n\nNOTE: Just wanted to provide an update on how to find this hidden gem.....again when you heading out of the valley going North on I-17......look for exit 242 as you pass the Anthem Outlets and you will be in PIE CENTRAL.....wohoooo!!!!!! Hope this helped ya!!!"
"2","Only reason they get two stars is because their pies are great. Terrible service and don't have enough people working so it takes half an hour to get anyone to even acknowledge that you are waiting."
"1","Today this cafe suck for customer service.. The wait staff is clueless on the customer experience. The food is okay but there better choices up the road."
"2","The worst fries I've ever had! The best pulled pork Reuben. The banana cream pie needs bananas in it or else it is just a cream pie. The crust was non existent! Overall disappointed dining experience!"
"1","Usually really good but today food was horrible.  I order carne asada nachos,  chips were full of oil, beans and carne asada tasted dry/old, hardly had a guacamole and sour cream and cheese didn't melt. Salsa was watered down had no flavor very disappointing."
"1","This place was straight up N.A.S.T.Y. \nI am prior military so I have eaten some not so good meals. I'm not a picky person. I think you can pretty much doctor up food to be edible....that was until today! I took one bite of my tostada and I refused to eat anymore. I literally was grossed out and by the time the staff noticed our table, I wasn't even willing to order something else. I was disappointed."
"1","Um...Wow!  I don't think they have maid service in this dive of a hotel.  After checking in, I opened the blinds.  Filthy windows with lips, nose and tongue marks from what looked like children who stayed their before me.  Room reeked of something nasty like urine, mold and mildew all mixed together.  Went to use the bathroom and it's a good thing I didn't sit.  The man who stayed there before me had peed all over the seat and nobody bothered to clean it before giving the room to someone new.  \n\nWent back to the lobby to get a new room.  At least the toilet was clean in this one.  But the sink had some dirty stains all over it from the last guest.  And their hairs were still in the shower which was apparently not cleaned.  All of the water cups in the room had holes in them and were unusable.  The bath towels were all different shades of stained dingy white covered in dirt and I had to borrow towels from the friends I was visiting.  Scared of the bed, so I slept with all of my clothes on.  Worst motel I have ever stayed in and definitely way over priced."
"3","Love's has everything you could possibly need on a road trip.  Cheap gas, tons of drink choices, a bunch of options for grub!  I knocked down the stars a bit for this particular location because the bathroom was not that clean compared to some spotless Love's bathrooms I have seen in the past."
"1","Every time I go here there is always something wrong with my order always check your food before you leave I guarantee you will always be missing something or something ain't right."
"3","I really don't have much to say about this one, but if you are going to the movie theater that is located in the same center, it is a good place to grab a drink or a bite. I take my niece on our \""girls day out\"" movie trips here for lunch and she enjoys it. \n\nI usually have a grilled chicken salad and she always has a pizza, so I can't really say that I have tried what they are famous for.. since I don't eat pork, but the atmosphere is always high energy and the servers are usually pretty good and fast."
"2","Its Chilis and you know what you are getting before you walk thru the door.  I like the chicken enchilada soup and ceasar salad.  I had to wait for my soup because they were making more and when I did get it...well it was so watery that I didnt eat it.  My salald was good.  Sat in the bar and the batender was friendly."
"5","Stopped here after visiting the Wildlife World Zoo and Aquarium. \n\nA friend and I were driving down Litchfield Road looking for some place to eat and I saw it out of the corner of my eye. My friend was like, \""Hey, why not....\"" and into the parking lot she turned. \n\nLike other people have said it's not the most spectacular looking place from the street...plopped at the end of a shopping center. I wasn't expecting much....but it kind of turned out like a Susan Boyle.....that whole judging a book by it's cover thing. \n\nService was prompt and attentive. It's a small place and it didn't seem too busy. We sat on the patio and I have to say that parking lot is the QUIETEST parking lot of any shopping center I've ever been in. Very relaxing. \n\nLike I said, I wasn't expecting much and wasn't sure what to order. I was torn between a few things and ended up ordering the fettuccine alfredo. As soon as I ordered it I was like, \""Ugh...why did I order that?\"" It's just sometimes a restaurant will make a fettuccine alfredo that just leaves a strange aftertaste in my mouth. Don't know if it's the cheese they use or what. So, like I said, I was dreading it. That whole Susan Boyle thing I alluded to earlier. \n\nStarted with some bread and a small salad with a creamy Italian dressing. Pretty good. \n\nThen out came my fettuccine alfredo. It looked good....and it smelled good. And I have to admit it was the BEST fettuccine alfredo I've ever had. Creamy, rich, and oh so good. I was SO happy I ordered it. \n\nWe ended with a creme carmel for dessert which was just right to top off our dinner. \n\nAfter dinner went inside to use the restroom and the restaurant was even smaller inside than I thought. \n\nChatted a bit with one of the employees about the restaurant and the owners. Very friendly and warm atmosphere. \n\nI don't get out that way much but if I'm around there again I will definitely stop in again. Thanks, Bella Luna, for surprising me with a great dinner. \n\nMoral of the review: Don't judge a book by it's cover....a singer by the way she looks....or a restaurant by it's location. Really. Don't."
"2","I've been here twice now and I'm not very impressed.  The service is slow and even when there is clearly no one else in the restaurant.  The food wasn't much better, it was ok, but a bit expensive for what you get."
"1","Went there for lunch . . . The food was average, had to ask for parmesan for the pasta, no salad dressing except Italian and just oil and no butter for the bread. The service was mediocre and the drink prices were just plain outrageous, even by PHX in-season standards. The cost of our 2 drinks was as much as our 2 lunch entrees. The atmosphere was that of a typical shopping mall restaurant. My 1st and last trip to this restaurant. It is overpriced and overrated."
"4","I went here on friday night because I was celebrating my graduation with my family. We had to wait like 45 minutes but, it was expected for a friday night. When we got seated, we got seated by a very nice hostess. She was polite and talkative. She seated us in a nice booth. We waited a little while before we were helped by our waitress but when she did help us she gave us what we wanted. She seemed very distracted and like she didn't give us all of her attention but its understandable she was busy so no worries. The food was excellent! better than I expected. I had the Terriyaki sirloin and it was a great! I loved it because it was sweet, and I was still able to taste the meat. I will come back again."
"1","Came here for dinner after not visiting this restaurant for all most over a year and now I know why I haven't . They ran out of ribs so I order the 10oz steak and it taste burnt and it was very tough! I didn't even finish half the steak ! The happy hour specials are great but there dinner entires  are horrible ! Also the men's restroom was a mess trash over flowing with dirty paper towels and the floor was covered in urine ! Probably won't be visiting T.G.I Friday's anytime soon!"
"1","The best part of the meal was our server, she was friendly and attentive.  The food was pathetic.  Ordered potato skins and each one had a few crumbs of bacon and a pinch of cheese, about the size of a quarter on each.   My  friend ordered the spinach dip and it was good, but I was still disappointed looking at my potato skins sitting there so lonely and naked...Sat near the window, big mistake, it was so hot!"
"2","We loved this place a few years ago, but great food is on the menu but exiting the kitchen. Both of us here and I eat alone."
"1","Went for dinner with my brother and my mom. We are all disappointed. We rather have spend the money at Tagliani down the street. The place had no more than 8 tables of customers. So you expect you would have more attention from your server. NOPE. My brother noticed the portion of the food was extremely smaller, but the prices are the same. Everything was just OK tasting. \n\nI do not think I will be back...due to the service and quantity of food you get."
"4","Took the family out to this Macaroni Grill because we wanted to avoid the crazy wait at the Olive Garden in Surprise.\n\nWas able to get right in and be seated immediately which was nice.  Service was prompt, efficient, and attentive.\n\nThe server apologized upon bringing out my dish, (spaghetti and meatballs) because the kitchen did not put enough meatballs on my dish and she said there would be a slight delay in getting them and that they were comping my meal from the ticket.  Wow!  I was impressed, because I really would not have minded a wait, so it was a nice and professional gesture.\n\nAnyways, overall the food was good, portions were insanely huge and as I write this I have my leftovers to finish for lunch.   Overall, I think this location does a great job and has an interesting menu.  \n\nEnjoy!"
"1","I want to start off by saying that for the most part, I really enjoy Macaroni Grill. The problem is not with the Macaroni Grill, but simply with the service at this restaurant. My wife and I went this Macaroni Grill a few weeks ago and had a terrible experience. The waitress wasn't attentive. She kept forgetting about us. We left upset.\nI am a forgiving guy, so my wife and I tried again. We had a different server this time with the same result. The place was virtually empty, so I would expect that they would pay a little closer attention to us. I didn't happen. I had to flag down a waiter to get the check and get out of there. Very Poor Customer Service."
"1","We use to love this place....but we will never be back again after two consecutive trips of lousy service and food.  \n\nOne visit, I ordered pesto sauce with pasta.  The pasta was cooked perfectly, that was the only part done right.  The pesto had no flavor.  I was a watery green thin and oily sauce.  Didn't taste basil or nuts of any kind.  By far the worst pesto sauce I have ever had!   The portion was a joke too!  All the pasta on my dish could fit inside my baby's 8 oz bottle!  I'm not a big eater by any means, this was a perfect portion for me, but for the price there should had been at least double the amount of food!\n\nThey use to have a mango ice tea that was really good, but they did not have it the last couple of visits.  The bread is ok, but the entree doesn't come with soup or salad, something just doesn't seem right with that.  For the price they charge, dessert should be included!  \n\nMy children each ordered a kids meal, grilled chicken breast was very thinly sliced, about as thick as two quarters, so it was over cooked, burnt and bland.  Don't even bother with it!  Spaghetti and meat sauce was also bland!!  The kids size meal was the the same size as my meal, but half the price!\n\nMy boss treated us last week, again, poor poor experience.  Very consistent with the previous visit, but we were at the Bell Road location.  Portion was very small, I guess they want everyone to eat less pasta because its a fatten food.  They want you to really feel like you are in Europe!   Children's entree, chicken tenders,  was again over cooked and dry.   My shrimp pasta dish had 5 pieces of shrimp for $16.99!  Do I feel rip off!  \n\nGood Bye to Mac Grill, you are a Closed Chapter."
"1","This place is very unorganized.  I will not be back.\n\nWe had to ask twice to get menus.  The pre-meal bread was cold.  Got the beverage near the end of the meal. They were out of the entree that my guest ordered. It took them 15 minutes to realize that and let us make another selection.\n\nThe sauce on the pasta I ordered was disgusting.  It tasted only slightly better than Chef Boyardee. \n\nAvoid this place and go to a better restaurant  ..."
"3","Decent food that you'd expect from a local restaurant that specializes in Mexican food. In short nothing to write home about..."
"3","It's Cracker Barrel standard. Good food at a reasonable price. They know how to cook eggs TO ORDER (which can be something of a rarity). They don't come out over easy or over medium no matter how you actually order them and the ingredients are good for the price. The place gets busy...especially in the winter and fall, but no problem now. If you want a quality breakfast at a good price, stop on in."
"1","Never again.  The apple french toast (~$12) and the sampler (includes a little of the chicken dumpling, sugar crusted ham, and meatloaf - ~$14) and both were huge disappointments.  The only saving grace, for me, was the cranberry-pomegranate (or something similar) iced tea, which wasn't too sweet (yay!) and very refreshing (~$3).  \n\nOther important info: chain restaurant, country store and rocking chairs were fun, overwhelming menu, cleaning could be improved, and slow service."
"4","I love eating there breakfast here. Country boy is my fav. Love the steak and hash brown casserole. My order was almost perfect except i got wheat bread not white, i don't like wheat but no big deal. Mike my server was great, friendl, and nice"
"5","I have been to a few chircoprators over the years but never as good as Dr. Skabo!!!!! He takes his time to evaluate you and makes sures he's covering everything. He even takes his time to answer questions if you have any. He even helps out with nutrition!!! Dr. Skabo is super nice and very well educated in his job and takes great care of his patients. And Cecilia, receptionist/ office manager, she is the nicest person ever and has great customer service skills...she is so personal with every patient and knows them and treat everyone as if they were family (which I happen to love businesses that do this). Office is very clean and everyone there always looks professional. Highly recommend this office to anyone!!!!!!"
"2","The staff was friendly and accommodating. I had an arrangement made for my grandma. After I left I looked at the flowers and some of the roses edges were dried/dead. I think the flower arrangement was over priced for what you what you got. :-("
"2","I have been here about 3 times, twice  for the weekend breakfast buffet and once for lunch. The food is similar to Denny's, so nothing special here. Everything here feels dingy and dirty, there was hair in one of the dishes in the buffet. Service is average, but employees are just as dirty looking as the restaurant..will not be coming here anymore."
"4","Very good dive bar that can hold half the town.  Good spot and it is only blocks away which make it my spot to go for a drink.  I did go this Saturday  though and it was super super packed with college age kids and was just not my scene.  I will be back many times just don't think I'll go on the weekends unless I'm in the mood to be around a lot of people."
"4","Its one of the only country bars around on west side of town. Good live bands. Food is average. Some great swing dancers here on Friday and Saturdays. Strange thing is, the other room has hip-hop, so the mix of people is different to say the least. You have to see the Redneck Revolution. They play there often. Oh yea, cash only, they have an ATM inside."
"5","I dare you to find a better burger, chili or steak for the price. I love this place. It has a Grain Belt bar light. Need I say more?"
"3","Love this place!!\nWe were here on Monday sept. 15, 2014 and JJ was our bartender and she was the most accommodating and considerate person we had encountered since the beginning of our 3 day trip in Goodyear, Arizona. We came here today; Tuesday sept. 16, 2014 and our bartender was an arrogant, inconsiderate, slow, weak-pouring, rude, and unappreciative person. Had been tipping her at lease 20-50% on every tab. She thought she was comfortable enough to tell a person of our party(my girlfriend) to take the \""bitchy\"" look off of her face. JJ would have never done that.., she was still considerate and fun..which is what you need when you're out of town. \nAll in all, who ever this chick is she is \""BUTTHURT\"" about something and she shouldn't be taking it out on us. \nShe started getting busy and getting impatient... Hey girl, we're here and paying your bills...I'm typing this out at the table inside the establishment and she hasn't even been here to check on us. She IS NOT GOOD AT SERVING. Not bartending regardless. If we had JJ this whole time we would come back..as of right now I think we'll call ahead to make see who is working.."
"1","This is the GHETTO! Awful and lazy customer service!! I booked a reservation online and when I came in, I waited half of an hour to be greeted/helped, although there were only two people in line, on a Tuesday. Then the customer service rep told me they were out of cars, even though I had a prior reservation. She also rudely interrupted my friend (who was thankfully there for moral support). She then directed us to her manager, who also did nothing to help the situation. That girl needs to be fired. Not to mention that this branch has a dreary front office with almost no furniture and outdated 90's posters on the wall. Felt uncomfortable all around."
"4","Give me 4 slices of thick -sliced bacon, actually cook my eggs over medium like I ask and have butter coverage all over my toast, you get 4 stars! Really Simple... \n\n\nNah seriously, this is a good breakfast, solid contender. You can get Hash-browns or Home Fries. The Home Fries are always my first choice anywhere and here they get topped with this onion-pepper mixture after -cooking which I am not a big fan of though. So, I ask them to leave it off and then request the potatoes be cooked crisply- about half the time does it come out right, but that is OK, when it actually gets done it makes it a 5 star awesome breakfast! \n\nTook my brother and his family to breakfast and they really liked it. My brother got a 'Joe Bear Scramble' which he liked and was plated so appealingly, the lady at the table next to us saw his and ordered this for herself. SIL got the HUGE Chicken Fried Steak and really liked it, she is finicky so this is good. 7YO Nephew got the Cinnamon Roll French Toast (4 pcs) which he liked. But, we had to order him a side of bacon because it does not come with any meat. Hard to justify $10 plus breakfast for a 7year old but oh well, I stole a bacon leaving him 3 pieces which he gobbled up! Suggestion, half the order and add bacon as another option, the pieces are large enough to make this a solid plate for women or kids. \n\nThe interior is on old Denny's and needs to be refreshed soon and parking can get tricky after 9:30am on a Sunday. \n\nSo, if you are in town for NASCAR or Spring Training at Goodyear Ballpark, this location is right off I-10 (Southwest side). Go here or to Mimi's (Northwest side)) for breakfast, but please, stay in Goodyear and keep businesses thriving so I have a job. Thanks :) \n\nTo get 5 stars I would say ramp up the home fries a bit, they are missing something but I can't quite put my finger on it, maybe use fresh onion without the bell-peppers (their \""mix\"" seems to be pre-made frozen prepped kind) and cook with the potatoes to caramelize versus heaping them on after in a wet mess? Dunno, but probably. \n\nEnjoy!"
"3","Our waitress was a grouchy bitch, and there was no fresh OJ, but other than that it was OK.  Loved the sign at the register that read \""No Open Carry\"" of weapons.  Hahaha!  I was concealing, anyway..."
"1","Meh. I have to say I've had way better, I've seen worse. This hotel was a cheap late night find off of I-10 as we traveled from California to Texas. The staff was pleasant enough, the building/rooms old but looked to be recently remodled. I do not really like hotels that are open to the outside, meaning the entry doors face out into the elements. (I prefer the entry to rooms enclosed within secured buildings.) So this made me nervous because the areas away from the lobby are not wel lit and dark. The room looked clean but very tired in my opinion with dark, worn carpet; yellowed, dirty switch plates and typical economy hotel dressings. The bathroom was freshly updated with tile, new coats of paint (in main room too), and new fixtures. But, the bathroom was not spacious at all and left a claustorphobic feeling. The clothes closet was more of a nook with a rod which was a first for me to see in a hotel... Kind of corny and cheap. The water though was nice and hot and the tub sparkly clean. The beds were firm but comfortable enough to sleep on and had stacks if feather pillows - NOT my favorite options from hotels though for sanitary reasons. The room had standard furniture with a nice HD LCDtv. The microwave was great but the fridge not very cold. The a/c was odd to control and did not want to stay on at the temp I selected (colder) but fortunately it was a cool night and we were cool enough to sleep. This room was not \""horrible\"" but I just couldn't get past a dirty vibe and I personally was not at ease with the room. Like, I cringed at the idea of walking barefoot across the carpet- even though I am sure the carpet was vaccumed (too dark to tell). And, I wondered if I might wake up to bedbugs. (Envoked paranoia) So that said, the hotel is probably what you would expect from a cheaper economy standpoint but I definitely DEFINITELY would not opt to stay at this place again."
"2","Don't come to the Best Western Plus Phoenix Goodyear Inn expecting the Ritz-Carlton at Dove Mountain. \n\nDude and I booked through Expedia to stay here for one reason and one reason only: Avoid a DUI.  \n\nWe went to Oktoberfest with some of my colleagues at the Airline Training Center of Arizona (Lufthansa) and German Air Force Base across the street. \n\nI've stayed at Best Westerns in the past, and have had good experiences. \n\nThe price was fairly reasonable - and again, we were NOT expecting luxury - However, the crap smells emitting from bathtub drain throughout the room were competely unacceptable. \n\nDidn't even bother with a shower, but it was still gross. \n\nThe room also wreaked of cigarette smoke. \n\nNot my first choice for DUI avoidance in the future; we'll find another cheap hotel if we go party with our German buddies next year."
"1","I've eaten at quite a few waffle houses in my day, so I know not to expect much. They're usually pretty good and this one was about the same. BUT I was VERY disappointed at the service at this place. It took almost 5 minutes just for someone to get our drink order(the place was not busy) and the table was still dirty from the previous customers. I saw 2 employees on their cell phones while cooking food. Another employee was actually walking around talking on her cellphone while working. But the one thing that got me, was seeing 3 employees drinking beverages around the food. One server kept her coffee cup on the tray that held the syrup(which was right by our table). Another server had his on the counter near the stove. And another had hers near the coffee machines and I saw them quite frequently drinking from them. I know this isn't the grandest place the eat, but I was expecting a bit more than how I saw the employees behaving..."
"1","The absolute WORST nail salon I have ever walked into. I didn't even get my nails done. I walked out because I was so disgusted by their lack of customer service. \n\nI went here because they have children's pedi chairs. I take my 3 year old there after a long day at work because I promised her a mommy day. I walk in and explain she doesn't really need a pedi just her nails painted. He tells me $5 and as my daughter runs over to the kid chairs (which no one was using or waiting for) stops her and tells her she can't sit in a chair unless she gets an actual pedicure. My daughter bursts into tears and he tells her \""too bad\"" ASSHOLE!\n\nI walked out and went across the street to Angel Touch Nails. They gladly accommodated me and my daughter and let her sit in a chair\nEven tho they don't have the kid ones. \n\nPeople take their hard earned money places to have experiences! It's not just about\nThe money people. This business should be ashamed!"
"3","I went in there because I really needed a hair cut for school pictures the next day. The girl that checked me in didn't know how to work the computer, or the credit card machine. When I mentioned a defuser for my bleached blonde she was confused about what I was talking about!!! When she cut my long blonde hair she wet it down and then took half an inch off and re-layered it. I paid and left with it wet which was odd to me. I went grocery shopping and when I got home it was dry and my hair looked like a hack job! It was not blended and it looked like a kid at cut it. It wasn't even and you could see the obvious layers and cutting lines!!! I was pissed. I went back in to get it fixed the next day and thank God Rachel was there and she styled and fixed it. She had to take off another half inch of my hair so that it would blend, that's how bad it was cut the night before by the other girl. It took her over an hour to fix it. While I was there I watched a lady with purple hair cut three other people's hair, she washed their hair and cut it wet and didn't even dry it!! I'm sure their hair didn't turn out! Rachel gave me a business card and her number and she is the only one I will let touch my hair. I plan on going back to have her touch up my ombr\u00e9 soon as well. \nLadies with long thick hair beware!!! Rachel seems like the only girl who knows what she is doing!"
"5","Jerry with Time Saver is a true professional. Honest, relaiable and has the experience most people only dream about. \n\nYou will not be sorry you called Time Saver for your plumbing needs."
"2","My son has OT in the same parking lot, so I have come to this place a few times for lunch. First thing that turned me off was a huge tip jar they have in your face when you order. They have a sign saying that they prefer cash, and that 'credit card and debit card fees break small businesses'. Huh? The first thing I ate here was shrimp fajitas, which with drink was about $15. Very small portions and not worth it. Chips are ok, but the salsa and picante sauce are in squirt bottles...and cold as heck. If you want any kind of side, it costs a dollar or more. I got a burrito the next time I came here (it was good, the Healthy Bean one) and it is 5.50, but if you want sour cream, guacamole, and chicken (they try to press it on you) that will be another nearly 5 bucks. It's good but not very big. Drinks are in small styrofoam cups and cost 2 bucks. They have a sign saying NO OUTSIDE DRINKS. I can see why, they have a racket going here on their overpriced drinks. The straw that broke the camel's back is that I waited in line behind two people who couldn't make up their mind for twenty minutes, and the woman behind the counter tried to help the woman BEHIND me first. WTF? Not great service, food is ok with skimpy portions, cheapo atmosphere, TIP JAR in your face...skip this place."
"5","Awesome place all around!"
"4","Spent two nights here for a family event.  Since I love older resorts and historical sites this type of hotel was a perfect choice. Check in was quick and getting a roll away bed was no problem. The grounds are well kept and the style Territorial or SW is so charming.  The pool we visited was the kid-friendly one that has two waterslides.  The ONLY exception to the stellar customer service however occurred at the pool. Our server was a very young (16?) girl who took our drink order and disappeared for 25 minutes. Keep in mind that it is at this point 103 degrees in the shade. And she didn't seem to be busy at all as we could see her from where we were sitting.  My husband noted that many hotels and resorts now include a 20 percent gratuity automatically and that it was unfortunate because servers aren't incentivized to provide a good customer experience.   Finally he got up and walked over to the bar and simply asked the bartender for his drink. The young girl seemed to disappear as he walked up. A few minutes later my husband had his  drink and returned to our spot at the pool when a more mature server (Christine maybe?) greeted us and apologized for her coworkers lack of service. She was from Chicago as is my husband and they chatted for a moment. Later we confirmed that the 20 gratuity was not included but that younger server was probably not well-suited for her job."
"5","This is my favorite local Mexican place - great chips and pico de gallo along with good fresh food.  At lunch I like the #1 combo- taco, enchilada, rice and beans.  I don't order bean very many places-- these are so good that I will order them as a dip for my chips!  Friends like chimis and tilapia too."
"4","Great food & fun atmosphere!\nIt is one of those low-key place you look for when trying to find something unique. I have had fun everytime I've been there. Plus its a great place to learn a little about the history of Litchfield Park and how far it has come. Its a perfect dinner venue on the 4th of July for the fireworks displays from Goodyear & Litchfield Park.\nmmmmm, ready for lunch right now, right now!!!"
"3","We visited there on a Friday night....sometimes the best time to see a restaurants potential is when the placed is packed.  Out waitress was friendly, informative and seemed eager to assist.  Good, I like being taken care of.  There were just two of us so we sat at a small 2-top near the front door. Seating was minimal inside...had the weather been warmer, we would have loved to sit outside but bit the case that evening.  Chips and Salsa were brought out immediately and were quite flavorful.  The Salsa is mild but there were two other variations which would melt plastic  so be wary.  I love it HOT but not everyone can handle it.  We ordered two Margarita's on the rock, the house blend, nothing special and they were nice, just what the DR. ordered.  My dining companion had a child's-plate of Cheese Enchilada, rice and beans.  I ordered the Spanish Flag Enchilada's, one chicken, one beef and the other spinach.  The food came quickly and was piping hot!  The beans were good but the Spanish Rice was institutional at best.  Mixing the two together was the way to make them palatable.  The Cheese Enchilada was tasty as were my three.  The Chicken was shredded, as was the Beef and the Spinach very creamy.   We chose not to try dessert this time and the check came quickly.  Not a bad night out but very simple dinner at best.  I think the service trumps the quality of the food more than anything.  A few good Margarita's will take care of that any time!  For a quick and easy meal that's affordable, it worked well for me."
"3","Wow all the other Yelpers were right on with this one.  The chips and salsa are amazing.  The atmosphere is very cool with the outside misters and big screen TV's to watch the game.  However the food was so-so.  If I were to go back it would be great for appetizers and beer to watch a game."
"2","The second time I went here, it was absolutely horrible.  I ordered a vegetarian dish.  It came out stone cold.  I sent it back and it came out a second time, covered in cheese and when I dug in, I found meat.  They didn't even care!  I sent a letter to the owners and NEVER got a response.  This place is a disgusting excuse for a restaurant.  BEWARE!"
"1","Service & food sucked. Walked in with a group of 13 people and was told by the bus boy to seat ourselves. After literally 10 minutes, we were finally able to sit down after my family members rearranged different tables around to accommodate. Not once during this whole time did the servers offer to help; instead, they walked around us pretending to be busy (the restaurant was almost completely empty). I made the mistake of ordering fish tacos in Arizona... The tilapia was disgustingly FISHY and no amount of squeezed lemon was able to save it. I also had to ask for more corn tortillas from the kitchen because the original ones that came wrapped around it were completely soaked through from the rice and beans (to the point where I couldn't even pick them up--they all fell apart). Margaritas were ok, as were the salsa, chips & quesadilla that we had as apps. Came here last year (when we again stayed at the Wig Wam Resort across the street) and forgot about how less than mediocre this place was.  If it wasn't for my FIL not wanting to drive, we definitely wouldn't come back here. Now we know. Blegh."
"4","I stopped here for lunch while visiting friends over the weekend.  I've been here many times years ago when I lived in Goodyear Az and always had a good experience but this time was only mediocre.\n\nThe art and food festival was going on down old litchfield road which brought out a ton of people.  Surprisingly, there was an open table on the patio though and we didn't have to wait at all.  The place was very crowded though and it took almost an hour and a half to get our food after we ordered.  I got the enchiladas suizas which are usually very good but this time mine were only luke warm at best.  No one else at the table complained.  The chips and salsa were good as well, they bring out two types (a spicy one and a milder chunky one).\n\nOverall, this is a decent mexican restaurant (probably the best one in Goodyear).  They have good food and it is in a nice scenic part of town tucked away in old litchfield park.  They also have a full bar but I think their margaritas are a little too sweet."
"3","After choosing our table and having it cleaned, the same young waitress returned with chips, salsa and menus. I asked the waitress for a Coke to which she replied \""I'm not your server\"". After waiting a little while our designated server appeared and took our order. Our designated server delivered our first round of drinks and our food. The rest of the time we were constantly asked by the first waitress if we needed anything, including refilling our drinks. I think we were in a server parallel universe.\nBTW - the food was okay.\nBeware of the umbrellas at the tables. They have seen better days. After almost being beaned by one I spent the rest of the meal holding on to it so it wouldn't fall on me again."
"2","The people that work here have been so helpful and honest in accommodating me with my pool questions and needs - with one exception.  There is a young woman that works here that is the most rude and disrespectful person I've ever dealt with as a customer at a commercial establishment.  She mumbles and talks extremely fast and when you ask for clarification, she rolls her eyes, sighs and acts out as if she's being bothered. I've had to deal with her 3x now and her attitude is horrible.  Seek out anyone at the store except for this gal with blue hair and gobs of eyeliner because she is absolutely awful and mean.  I won't go back here as long as I have to deal with her."
"2","When we have been in the store, gotten water tested and purchased product, all was good.  We like that the business is locally owned, so we contracted them to come blow out our lines as our suction was depleted on the side inlet of the pool. The gentleman came out to our house, looked out our pump and set the handle and said that the pool lines didn't need blown out, it was just that our pump was too small. That was last August and we continued to have issues with the pool's side inlet so we called them back to see if they could take another look. The representative told my husband that it would be another $85 to have them come out. Considering that they kept our entire $85 from last time and did not do the job, we declined. We then went to Home Depot, purchased items that would allow us to clean our own lines. Surprise, surprise, there was a Hot Wheels car in the side inlet that was blocking our lines. We knew there was something in there and we were right. \n\nThe store is fine, the products are well priced, but their customer service when it comes to the service we bought for them to blow out our lines was unacceptable.\n\nWe won't be back. Leslie's is closer anyway."
"1","*  Very dirty dinning area!!\n*  Employees obviously do not care about customer service \n*  McDonalds should pull their affiliation - very bad representation of the brand"
"3","I have to say it appears my idea of a great zoo differs greatly from my fellow yelpers.\n\nThis zoo does have some great features.  Fantastic variety of animals from all over the world.  And if you like tigers, this is the zoo for you.  The animals appear well-cared for and the grounds are reasonably clean.\n\nHowever, it escapes me how this zoo can warrant a five-star rating given the number of \""exhibits\"" that are merely large cages sitting side-by-side like little hotel rooms.  Don't get me wrong, some of the exhibits are great and well-designed.  But many others are terrible and seem to offer little to the animals except shelter.  Perhaps this zoo houses more animals than it can adequately support.\n\nFor $18 a ticket, I expect more.\nI"
"4","Another nice zoo offering in Arizona, with the addition of an aquarium. (I find it odd there isn't an aquarium in downtown Phoenix though.) \n\nAnyway, we started on the zoo side and saw many cool animals who seemed to spend most of the day lounging around or playing with habitat mates. They have many birds, reptiles, and even a baby animal nursery. Animals are diverse and worth spending the first half of your day with before you head over to the aquarium. Be sure to check out the albino wallaby! (Interesting to see an albino in the always constant Arizona sun.) \n\nIf you are feeling adventurous, head over to the hands on exhibits where you can run your hands along the back of a stingray, or pick up starfish. \n\nAll in all, a great zoo/aquarium and though it's a little more expensive, it's worth the money. Use your entertainment book for the valuable two for one coupon!"
"5","We loved it, our one year old loved it, my parents loved it.\n\nThe outside was surprisingly new looking and inviting. The entrance fee was inexpensive and once we got inside we figured out why. There are a few rides, but you have to pay extra for them. Since we had our baby with us, most rides were not for us, so we were glad we didn't have to pay for them.\n\nThe diversity of animals is amazing, including the aquariums.\n\nMust go and tell your friends. We've been in Phoenix for 10 years and its our first time. We need to spread the word so it won't be a secret any longer!"
"3","We went to the Wildlife World Zoo to check out the aquarium and see what kind of reptiles they had. It's only a few minutes from where we live and we love to go to different zoos. The biggest problem with this zoo is the ridiculous entrance fee. Make sure to get a discount coupon if you're going to go (they have them in the West Valley View newspaper from time to time.)\nThe zoo itself is pretty cool. There is a large amount of birds of many different species as well as the normal large cats and Savannah ungulates. Of course our favorite part was the reptile house, including a giant Galapagos Tortoise along with many other snakes and lizards. There is also a place where children can interact with sulcata tortoises. \nThe aquarium is pretty nice. Its not the best I've ever been to, but also not the worst. The problem, as I already stated, is that it is the most expensive zoo I've ever been to."
"5","Great place, if you live in the area and plan to go alot,a.season pass is a good investment, considering a one time ticket is like $28.00. A all year pass for an adult is $100.00 and for kids $50.00. We love going there! the god is expensive so I always pack snacks and water. (they say ur not supossed to) but I always have! Bring change to feed the giraffes ,koi, ducks, and fish!"
"4","I went here yesterday and ate at Dillion's BBQ, I had a tiny issue with my food and they fixed it instantly and it was perfect. The manager was great with me, and I will defiantly be back"
"4","Rode over on our Harley with some friends. We enjoyed a great tasting lunch and a couple brews. Seems be out in the middle of no where... but we like these kind of places. Bet the place is jumping on the weekends, have to make it back some Saturday evening."
"4","We stopped here on tour one time.  And then one time again on the way back.  Had a nice meal, some beers, some shots, hung out for a bit.  Everyone working there was really friendly.  If I'm ever headed through again I'd definitely stop in."
"5","I have been going to the El Dorado Hot Springs for years and always have a relaxing time. Open your minds and give it a try...you won't be sorry\nMakes for a great \""day trip\""....lets relax"
"3","Staff here is usually very nice and helpful and not overbearing. Everything is kept nice and tidy. I just feel that this location does lack in variety and sizes..."
"2","Not a stellar location for Applebee's.  I am trying to forget the whole Ricky-Bobby thing and just be subjective.  What really loses me here is the menu.  Seriously high sodium fatty foods that always taste less than fresh.  I have to pass on these guys in the future.  \n\nThere is no compelling reason to eat here.  Lots of other good options in the area.\n\nThe Reuben is a salty mess."
"2","I've came here a couple of times. Nothing special here, just another big name franchise. You can tell they try to cater the younger customers. Never been a big fan of this franchise, but will come back to try something new or meet up with someone? Food is usually salty and not much flavor. There is a lot of other options out there for you to try instead."
"1","They refused to put air in my tires that were purchased there, they tried some scare tactic that tires would explode or some BS, this is a Cadillac that is only driven to the grocery store by my 86 y/o Mother. \nI took it to Fletchers, no problem.  I will never use Discount Tires again. Beware!!"
"4","HH is the kind of place you go to when you're low on cash, it's Monday night & you are willing to drive to pick up your food.  They used to offer a medium 1-topping pizza for $5.55 on Monday nights.  Last wk when I called to order the special, they said it changed to a large for $5.99.  The beauty of this offer is that you don't have to buy 3 pizzas to get that price like the other chains!!!!!  With the economy in the toilet, I was astounded that they increased the size thereby improving the value for my hard earned dollars.  \n\nAs for taste & quality--it's pretty good.  I like to order the thin crust and usually get sausage or pepperoni anything extra, I add on myself (e.g., red onion, black olives, etc).  They don't glop on the sauce or skimp on the cheese & I've never rec'd a burnt/nearly burnt pizza.  It's even pretty good reheated."
"5","Every time my sister and I come here we get exceptional service! The manager is awesome, the staff is so helpful, if they don't know the answer to something they will go above and beyond to make sure they find it for you!! We went to another Kohl's and it just reassured us to always come back to this one!!!"
"2","Every time I go here I regret it. The food is not very good obviously, but it is super cheap. Typically I'd prefer taco bell, but the taco bell on Waddell and Litchfield always sucks, so if I'm in the mood for bad,cheap fast food tacos I go here."
"3","While I am a fan of the chain itself, this location and I haven't quite seen eye to eye on some things. \nFor example, what is 'new' and what is 'used/floor model'. \nIn my opinion if something is out of the box, full of dust and glitter and has possibly been tested by customers, it's used and you should give at least 10% off if you don't have a new one to sell. \nTheir opinion; if it's not broken it's new, even if no box exists any longer and it has to be beaten and cleaned...... \nAlso, their computer search skills leave something wanting. I was looking for 3 items, they had only 1 and after doing a computer search told me that no store had 3. \nWhen I looked it up myself I found that a store very close by had 4. I called them, they reserved 3 for me and I picked them up that day. \nMoving on! lol\nThe staff is pleasant enough, the location is small but chalk full of great stuff :)"
"3","Overall each of my experiences at this particular Red Lobster have been okay. \nThe restaurant itself is clean. The bathrooms are kept up. \nThe service can be dicey. We went two times recently very close to each other. \n\nThe first time the service was pretty bad. I kept asking for our free cheddar biscuits and our waiter kept telling us they were making more and he would bring some out as soon as he could, despite the fact that other tables around us were receiving them. I finally stopped a manager and asked for them and we received the biscuits right away. I don't know if it was the waiters ploy to get us to order more items we would pay for but it was not successful. What he did succeed in doing was lowering his tip. Foolish waiter, he did not know I waited tables for 10 years and always way over tip for even adequate service. At any rate the rest of the meal was fine. I almost always enjoy the food there. \n\nThe second time we went we had excellent service. Our waitress was prompt with both the yummy biscuits and drink refills. I did, however have a complaint with the food. We ordered the potato battered shrimp and never have I eaten anything so salty in my entire life. My husband & I each took one bite and had to send them back, requesting something else instead. The waitress handled this beautifully, it was the manager, in this case, that didn't. The manager didn't even do a table visit. I also was in restaurant management for 15 years and I know the first thing you do when you have a customer complaint is GO VISIT THE TABLE! Instead we could see her rolling her eyes when the server brought this to her attention. She made the server come back to the table and collect the shrimps in question. The server did replace our shrimps with something else we did like and did so quickly. The rest of the meal was fine. \n\nSo yeah, overall it was fine. A couple of problems each time but always resolved quickly except for the lack of concern on the part of the manager. A good place to go and get some yummy food."
"1","Horrible! We waited in the lobby full of people for over 20 mins for a table. Normally I don't mind waiting but when I look and see servers shooting the breeze and half the restaurant empty well then it becomes an issue. Finally got a table, the food was horrible and then the bill came. What a rip-off!!! Stay clear of this place!"
"1","terrible conditions in prime time of year. mickey mouse layout. skip it."
"4","A great place to let the kids blow off steam on days with severe heat advisories! \n\nBetter pizza, games & prices than a place I will only refer to as Chucks :D\nGranted, the space is smaller & 90% of the tables are reserved for parties (seriously, there should be a limit on how many tables can be reserved!). If you just want to let the kids run around for a bit and eat some pizza without a party reservation, you'll want to send a scout ahead of you to find and hold a table.... not even kidding. \nThe quality of the pizza is not what it would be at other pizza establishments geared towards adult taste buds, but this place IS geared more at entertaining your kids than it is at providing gourmet pizza. As long as the kids are happy, safe & entertained, I'll eat what they give me happily, lol! \n\nThere is no mascot in costume OR 'show', but they have games for all ages, not just toddlers, so that's a plus! There are also 3 televisions set up in the dinning area & they are normally set to sports."
"5","I have been coming here for years. Best bakery on the west side. Huge variety. I just can't decide what I want when I'm there since everything looks so delectable and fresh."
"3","Just recently stopped off on my way home from work, called mama if she wanted anything for lunch? So she thought be a good idea to get Wendy's.\nI ordered Three cheeseburgers, order of chicken nuggets, and two large fries. I had the nuggets, it was ok. Not great? I would rather have them at chick fl'a instead. Girls had no problem mowing down the burgers, including the wife. Fries were actually good, forgot to tell them no salt. But it wasn't that much salt anyways. \nI like how the location use to be a bank, neat how the reconfigured it to make it work. Even though we have tried to stay away from fast foods, Wendy's was a nice change."
"3","Pleasant service and a good selection of cacti are available here.  I greatly appreciated all of the extra information on care for my new cacti, and helping me to avoid a few varieties that would require more effort than I was willing to provide.  Both premium examples as well as a few discount ones were available, depending on one's needs.  Free delivery and planting with $500 purchase.  I'm going to truly enjoy my new Saguaro and barrel cacti."
"5","Absolutely the best customer service ever!!  They always have the best rates and great vehicles.  I would recommend them over and over again!"
"5","Seriously surprised at the overall low-ish rating for this joint.\n\n Let me start by saying I am pregnant.  I am picky, hungry, and have something to say about just about everything (poor husband).\n\nHub and I decided at the very last second to try this place instead of KFC.  More options.  3PM on a Sunday is totally dead, and there is one server for the entire place, but seemingly handled well.  We chose to order our food to go.  \n12 Piece White Meat Broaster Chicken family meal\nMake your own 14\"" PIzza with chicken, spinach, and provolone. Half Cheese\n\nTook about 35 minutes for everything to come out, by then I was falling apart being so hungry.  One look at the pizza and was pleasantly surprised at how tasty it looked.  Eyes of pregnancy can be deceiving...however, not this time!!  Every bite of all this food was way more delicious than I was anticipating.  The broaster chicken is done to perfection; juicy, crispy, hot.  The pizza was nicely browned on top, with plenty of the toppings we requested.  Taste was phenom.\n\nI literally just finished eating and had to rave about how good this was.  Husband and I were equally impressed, and will return to try more goodies.  \n\nNot sure on service...girl taking orders was pleasant and got everything right."
"2","We've been here twice. Food is decent, but the service is horrible. From the time we sat down it took us about ten minutes to get WATER. After we ordered, it took 30 minutes for our SALAD to arrive. Yes, lettuce in a bowl took 30 minutes. Both times it was not busy, half full dinning room or less. If you have all day and you aren't very hungry, the food is decent, but if you'd like to enjoy yourself with out the pause of, \""where the hell is ____\"", and \""how long ago did we ______\"",  go somewhere else."
"2","Visited for a full set of silk nails, she automatically put acrylic on my nails not the silk I had asked for. I didn't ask for them to be taken off because the whole point of silk nails is they are less damaging than acrylic but when I told her I asked for silk she said I asked for acrylic. I would never say acrylic if I wanted acrylic I would just say full set. So I didn't argue but my acrylic nails turned out very thick and bumpy. Had to go to another salon to they them thinned up and smoothed out. She also left them very long after I asked her to cut them shorter and made my cuticles bleed. After I pulled my hand away she said she was doing it on purpose because my nail sea are too short so she was \""helping me\""."
"1","This place should be planted with orange trees. Very rough fairways and the owner doesn't know the first thing about customer service. Will not go back. The only saving grace is the hamburger and fries in the grill area. Would like to see them spend more money at great Eagle versus their other course Arizona Traditions."
"3","Just opened following winter over seeding. Course played surprisingly well. Tees and fairways were in good shape. The greens were really slow from the overseeing but held and putted very well considering. Expected to play \""automatic 2-putt\"" but all the greens were good. The rough was a golf ball eating monster. Deep heavy bermuda swallowed up shots and hid the balls. Would certainly play again."
"2","Ehh its ok!! The location at bell & reems is 10x better!! Better service there & better drinks. This one is okey.."
"4","I can't, for the life of me, remember the Barista who assisted me, but she was HILARIOUS and fun!  I would come back just for her customer service.  She was a little short blondie.  \n\nThe customer service was great.  It is located near a frozen yogurt place as well. Win!  Win!"
"1","Slowest and most disorganized Starbucks ever! 25 minutes for 2 regular coffees and a pre-made spinach wrap."
"3","Always a great selection of arts and crafts.  Of particular note is the fact they have a good selection of plastic models such as cars, airplanes, ships, etc and all the needed supplies to assemble them including glues, cements, and paints.\n\nThe prices on the models range from $10 to $30 and seem to be quite a bit cheaper than Hobby Lobby and Hobby Bench which are competing stores in the area."
"1","In the store today 2 times.....first AND last! I have never experienced such an unfriendly staff & the store is a mess."
"1","I went to Sarah's Hallmark yesterday for their Holiday sale and was very disappointed with the bait and switch tactics going on with the Vera Bradley bags. They were offering in their sale print ad one style of bag but when I got to the store, that bag was NOT the one they were offering with the sale price. And it wasn't because they didn't have it either!  When I asked the clerk about the proper price of the bag, she insisted that the owners made a mistake but that she couldn't offer the bag that was pictured at the discounted price. I told her this was bait and switch and asked her to call the owners to clarify. She wouldn't do it. You have to sell the bag pictured at the discounted price...plain and simple. Very disappointing."
"1","Sorry, folks...this is another Peoria/Surprise/Glendale pizza place I can take off my list.  Went there tonight - eat in - ordered a pepperoni & onion pizza.  I should have been concerned when it arrived and the pieces wouldn't break apart - with a kitchen knife and fork we were just barely able to cut them apart.  First bite...the crust was doughy and chewy and tasted strongly of flour.\nLong story short, the girl asked how things were, as she saw us eating the toppings and leaving the crust.  We told her of the crust and her response was \""Sorry.\""  I can't explain the 5 stars vs my one star, all I know is what the pizza was tonight.  Never, ever, again."
"4","Pretty decent location for a nice target store.\nWhen I lived in the area I would frequent this target location and was happy with the service and product selection.\nLocated in the surprise town center shopping district alongside many great shops."
"1","WORST STORE EVER!! Had to wait 45mins to pick up a padio set!!! Soo disorangized.. WORST SERIVICE!! Iam so disgusted i will never ever return!! HOME DEPOT ONLY!"
"5","Very good food!! A nice, clean and very friendly place. Prices are reasonable for authentic Mexican food. We have eaten there many times and always look forward to going back."
"1","I was there in the afternoon on December 31. Someone took a sharp object to the side of my car and the rear panel. They did $1200 in damage. Called Harkins and wasn't even told by manager that he was sorry. Had to write Harkins to even get an apology."
"1","If you love cocky pieces of crap that will try and rip you off and have no clue what there talking about .. I would highly recommend this place , If you want to go to a real Harley dealership with heart and soul and its family owned,  Buddy Stubbs is awesome I will never go anywhere else . Everyone there is really chill and incredibly knowledgeable and they actually treat you with respect .."
"3","First arrived and the family a little bored. The staff was nice but the displays need to improve. Great building. Luckily the simulation our family signed up for saved the day. We had a great time with the simulation crew. End if day it all worked out great and family happy."
"5","Meaghan has been doing my hair for 18years and she is amazing! I have followed her all over the city! She is very precise on her color, blending highlights and a perfect hair cut every time! I highly recommend give her a try and I promise you will be in love. She is also very reasonable priced for the excellent services! I love going to see her!"
"1","I have been to Great Clips a number of different times and have always been satisfied but my visit there on Thursday, 01/16/2014, was the last time I will ever go there again!!!!! It was at the Great Clips in the Deer Valley Marketplace located at the corner of W. Deer Valley Road & N. 83rd Ave. in Peoria.  When I first got there one of the women looked my name up under my phone number and put me on the waiting list. Then another woman called me up to the counter and asked for my name. I told her my name and she said it wasn't there. Then she asked for my phone number. I told her but I had to repeat it several times. She was very rude and was extremely hard to understand due to her accent. She said her name was Nina (later when I looked at the receipt it showed her name to be Niculina). She directed me to a chair and asked me how I wanted my hair cut. I asked her if she could check the notes in the computer to see how it had been cut the last few times I had been in because I wanted it cut the same way. She walked over to the computer and looked at it for a few seconds and said \""something happened to computer, there's nothing\"" and walked back to the chair. I told her how I wanted it cut but she wanted to do it differently. I told her no to do it like I said. Well after she cut my hair (If you can call it that) I asked her if she could rinse my hair off in the sink, not shampoo just rinse with water so I could get all the extra cut hair off and she said no she would have to charge me for a shampoo. So I asked if I could do it myself and she said no. Then she immediately put gel in my hair without even asking if I wanted any in my hair. It was ok because I use gel in my hair anyway but I thought it was odd. Well after I got home from having dinner I took a shower and my wife looked at me and said OMG!!! Your hair!!! Go look at it!\"" It is REALLY REALLY BAD! I have bald spots in a number of places where my hair is cut all the way to the scalp! How does someone do that?! Then there are other places that have long hairs that she did not even cut! To top it all off when I looked at my receipt she didn't even spell my name correctly, it reads Brayen not Brian??? I have e-mailed them and also called their corporate office and I am still waiting for them to call me back. The sad thing is I am job hunting and now I have hair that looks like a monkey cut it for bananas. I'm not saying ALL the stylists there are bad but if you do go there just make sure you DO NOT have Niculina (Nina) cut your hair."
"1","Honestly I REALLY don't like this location. I've never had a positive experience here. I eat at other locations at least a couple of times in the week and I won't go to this one anymore. The portions are skimpy compared to other locations. They are not friendly in the least. And make me feel like I'm being a burden (since I'm ordering a large order to go.) I'm more than happy to let others go in front, but even when I'm the only one in there I feel like I'm bothering them. The locations on 75th and bell and 59th and the 101 are my go to locations. Always so friendly and welcoming!"
"2","I came on a Monday... They were out of veal and steak. My dish was the spicy sausage rigatoni which good, not great. My wife had the shrimp pasta Alfredo... Disappointing! Sauce was plain. Turns out the sauce is already shipped here and they don't add any more spices to it. The shrimp tasted like the store bagged ones. Their bread was delicious. The mozzarella fritti was less than ok.  Staff was welcoming. The reason i gave it a 2 was because my dish was OK but my wife's dish was just not good. The Kraft's macaroni n cheese taste a lot better. Also, they were out of two main meats. Will not come back, unless i don't find a better Italian food. Im from Santa Barbara and have travelled all over the world and the states... By the way, my daughter ordered a pizza, which she says she enjoyed."
"1","Not impressed by the food. \nAtmosphere is crowded. Maybe they will be on Restaurant Hoarders. \nWaiter was a jerk. I asked for another and got one but she was dumber than a box of rocks (i didnt mean to insult rocks) \nToo expensive to deal with waiters with attitude and mediocre food!"
"2","Went earlier this evening with 2 people who have never been. Giving a 2/5 because the food was good, when we eventually got it. Otherwise, poor service!\n\nWe sat down at 4, the bartender took our drink order and while my friend was ordering an appetizer, the bartender walked off. Strike 1. \n\nWhen she came back a couple of minutes later, we placed our order, and we received the bread at about 415. We then received our garlic bread order at 430. At 445, the bartender came over, told us that the kitchen had been taking longer than usual (we were one of only 2 groups of people on that side of the room except for 3 people at the bar, otherwise the whole place was pretty empty), and that our food would be ready in a few minutes, and she took my drink to refill it. At 5, we still had not received our dinner order, the bread on the table had gone cold, and I still had not received my refilled drink back yet. Strike 2. \n\nAt 515, over an hour since we were seated, we finally received our food, and she asked us if we needed anything else. I told her she still had not brought my refilled drink back, and she gave me a blank look like I was retarded. I told her she took my drink earlier to refill it, and never brought it back. She then realized that I wasn't nuts, and brought me a new glass. I was upset (I didn't say anything to her) but it was obvious on my face and she told me she realized that she did forget to bring my drink back, so apologized for that. but it wasn't her fault that the kitchen staff got our food out slow. Strike 3. \n\nI like the Mesa location a lot, but this one definitely did not leave a good impression on my friends, and myself - will not be bringing them back to this one."
"2","Although we visited on a Saturday evening, we arrived around six, we were seated within 10 minutes because the restaurant was not very busy.  We were taken to a table which was not yet cleaned. After waiting a while for a waiter to take our drink order finally the manager took the order.  A nearby waiter recognized that we had been sitting for a long time without drinks or a waiter.  Because of him our waiter arrived a short time later and took our order.  We would have enjoyed our mozzarella garlic bread while we waited for our entrees, but it all arrived all together. The food, with the exception of the bread, was lukewarm at best.  While several tables around us cleared out, I never saw a busboy clear the tables.  We were disappointed by the discombobulated staff and disorganization in every step of our dining experience.  I honestly doubt I will returned this location."
"4","It has been about 14 years since I last visited BDB.  It was the one on Ray Road in Chandler.\n\nWe found a $10 off coupon on Amazon Local and they are now pushing much smaller lunch specials starting at 6.99.  The person I was with had never been, so we stopped in at this location.\n\nThe food is always delish here.  The meatballs are so tasty and the sauce they use is so, so good.  We decided to share a \""regular\"" small salad and it was still too big.  She ordered the chicken parm and added a meatball.  I ordered the rigatoni with sausage and meat sauce.   Much to my luck, the waitress mistakenly entered my order wrong and ordered me a regular dinner \""small\"" rigatoni instead of the much smaller lunch portion.  YAHTZEE!  \n\nBDB is so good, and it's a great place for large parties with large portions and even larger appetites.  After the ginormous salad, we had 5 take home containers and will have food for the next few days.\n\nBDB is definitely worth the trip but be sure you are hungry and have at least 3-4 people."
"5","I went here on Friday night and had an excellent time. Our waitress was extremely friendly and attentive and the food was phenomenal. We got an order of wings and the firecracker spinach artichoke chicken (I think that's what it was called). If for nothing else, I will be returning to eat that again! They had a big open room wit pool tables that you can rent, so we played for a bit. Although I suck, it was still pretty fun and the tables were nice. After our meal, the manager came over t ask us how everything was and gave us a card for a free appetizer on our next visit. \n\nThis was the best food, service and overall great dining experience I have had in a while. I will definitely be back!"
"4","I attended an informal business meeting here a while back and I was really impressed with the level of service.  Waitresses were around often but were not intrusive or pushy.  The manager was also making the rounds to make sure everyone was being taken care of.  If you can't relax, have fun and enjoy yourself in this place perhaps you need to look inward my friend."
"3","Went to Fox & the Hound to watch an OSU basketball game.  Sat in the bar area, pretty dark and dismal, but eventually they figured out how to get the game on the big screen.  Nice TV's and plenty of seating.   Lunch was a bit pricey but not terrible.  Tried the signature turkey sandwich/club on a pretzel dough roll.   Very tasty, but add two draft beers and my bill was $15.00   didn't really think it was that steep of a bar/pub food kind of place but apparently so!  Overall, it was adequate for watching the basketball game and drinking a beer with lunch, but I doubt i'll be running back to return anytime soon."
"2","Wait staff is in need of training and this place generally seems confused as to what type of business they are. Front of building says \""Smokehouse and Tavern\"" which would lead many to believe that it's a restaurant with a bar. The reality is that it's a sports bar that serves food and that is exactly what I got when eating there, \""Bar Food\"". I ordered a blue cheese and bacon hamburger (over priced in my opinion). I explained to the waitress that I wanted the meat done just so it was a little pink in the middle and she said \""so we'll go with medium rare\"" , I went along with it figuring she worked there and she would know best since I explained in detail what I wanted. Result: It came out very rare and almost raw in my opinion (just barely browned on outside and all pink everywhere else), there was barely any blue cheese to taste on it and the bottom half of my bun was soaked in grease just like I would expect from a burger at a bar. \n\nMy summary: might be a good place to get a drink and watch the game, but eat at your own risk.\nP.S. I saw another reviewer compliment them on the lunch menu, I went during the dinner hour."
"1","It's Denny's--how bad can it be? Well let me tell you...this visit to Denny's was B.A.D. It was over 90 minutes from start to finish and we were seated immediately on a weekday morning. Food came out S.L.O.W and our server was even slower. We didn't get refills nor were they even offered. My husband's pancakes were burnt on the outside and still runny on the inside. The fruit that came with my breakfast had been frozen and wasn't quite thawed out yet. I have eaten at this Denny's before and while the service has never been all that stellar, this was by far the worst visit to a Denny's I've ever experienced and because it's Denny's my expectations are pretty low to begin with. Do yourself a favor and skip this particular Denny's. You will save yourself the aggravation."
"5","I have never had bad service at this location. The food is always spot on and I am greeted with a friendly hostess. Last night I went and no one greeted me, the service was slow (because they were busy and only had three waiters on) AND I still left satisfied. Alicia really helped us out and did a great job keeping our waters full and our food came as promptly as it could. GREAT customer service will keep me coming back to this location. \nPlus THUMBS UP for the new decor!"
"5","Call ahead. Eat lots of rolls. Get the double pork chop, and you will be in heaven. \n\nKey is to call ahead.\n\nIve never had a problem here and always loved my food."
"1","It's the holiday season! I'm out Christmas shopping and trying to buy my father a gift that I have been searching every Ross in the valley for. I finally find one and the box was opened, so I wanted to check it to make sure all parts were there... Two clerks walk past and call over a third to contact someone (loss prevention) to assist the situation. Accused of attempting to steal the item, she says that she cannot sell to me because the item is now opened. My friend and I told her it was already opened and we wanted to make sure all parts were there because it was a gift. She walked off to talk to her manager and once again was disrespected and talked down upon!! I will never do business with this Ross!!!!!!!!"
"2","food is still good, but the set up is ridiculous, yeah put the soda and ice cream right next to where the soups and pasta are to cause a huge log jam of people. Also had a hair in my salad, not cool."
"2","For the price we had to pay to stay here (min. $193/night), we expected a bit more \""customer-oriented\"" services, much like we get in just about every other hotel we've stayed at.  They do not provide any guest services publications whatsoever.  We had to go to the lobby to find out what restaurants were nearby, and were handed a list that someone happened to type up for them.  That was it...all it had were names, addresses and phone numbers.  We then asked for a tv listing, and again, were handed another list.  The point is, we had to ask for this information.  The electrical system in our room was totally screwed up.  Trying to figure out how to turn off a set of lights, while keeping one utility light on was a nightmare.  We ended up guessing which plugs to put the lamp cords in to, in order to not have to turn all the lights on/off in the room.  Also, this place is running on one of the tightest budgets we've seen yet.  Paper cups, no soap dish at the bathroom sink, one bottle of shampoo (no conditioner or moisturizer), and a single serving of coffee for the pot (pod-type).\n\nThe good thing about this place is the location.  It's right across the street from the ballpark, and there are restaurants and shopping within walking distance."
"1","This Jack's has been closed!  Thank goodness since we got food poisoning from this place!  YUCK!"
"2","I was seated quickly however no one told us that there were not enough chef's for the tables. So after 45 minutes of waiting we left because we had movie tickets.  (I have no idea when the chef actually came, my guess is an hour) I've enjoyed this place before, however, I doubt I'll come back. If a restaurant wants business they respect their customers. I appreciate it when the staff is honest with their patrons.  I prefer that they let us know ahead of time that there is a long wait and then I can make that decision myself if I want to wait or not. Instead I waited for 45 minutes thinking a chef was on his way any minute."
"1","THIS LOCATION ONLY - Echoing another user's review.  There is now a large sign in the lobby stating \""We no longer accept Restaurant.com gift certificates.  Sorry for the inconvenience.\""  Inconvenience?  We *purchased* a gift certificate for your restaurant, drove all the way down there, and you refuse to accept it?  That's just not right.  If you didn't want to participate you shouldn't have offered the certificates in the first place.  Take them off the website but you should still honor the ones previously purchased."
"1","I've been boycotting this store since 2009.  One afternoon after browsing for a while with my kids, I allowed my 10yo and 8yo to stay in the children's section to pick out a book to spend their allowance money on while I ran next door to TJ Maxx to buy the toddler a pair of shoes.  I'd been gone 30 minutes when I returned to find the horrid lady in the children's section had called the police on us.  She never asked the kids  their ages and didn't ask if they had a way to reach me (they did).  The police talked to them, realized they were perfectly well behaved consumers, and assured me I'd done nothing illegal.  Avoid like the plague."
"2","Not bad food, combined with so so service. I tried the firebird chicken pasta and i have had better at chilies. I also don't drink soda so i ordered a lemonaid and since it was made at the bar  (non-alcoholic) they were 4 bucks each. it sounds like im cheap but 4 dollars for some sugar, water, and lemon? then 4 dollars for a second one? ok. the place was nice and huge on the inside, if i was taking a client out i would go there for the appearance but for my son, wife, and myself i think next time ill pass."
"2","***DON'T*** GO TO CELEBRATE A BIRTHDAY.  I was floored! $135 in food for 4 people to celebrate my husband's B-day and they don't do anything, we would have gone to the Black Angus or CARVERS they are near the same area, just as delicious steaks *and* less money $!!  At least at those places we would get a candle in a brownie just so we could say that we had him blow out a candle for his b-day.  I can't justify $28 entries that do not come with a soup or salad in this economic climate, and NO hospitality, so even though the food is good we won't be returning because we really only go for special occasions go to Carvers or Black Angus or even Outback! Before we return here!"
"1","Last night I met a friend for dinner.  She had a coupon for buy two appetizers get a free lobster/cheese appetizer.  I arrived first.  Stuck my hand in something sticky, and the appetizer plate was dirty.  She arrives and immediately announces the coupon and orders.  15 mins (or more) passes and the manager walks over to tell us we must order from the wood fire grill to use the coupon - would we like to change our order.  She ordered two entrees and I ordered a salad $15.95.  No thanks!  (Mind you why did it take so long to put the ap order in to begin with).  Another 10-15 mins goes by and he comes back over to try and sell again the \""up order\"" tells us there is nothing he can do.  I said, look I'm really hungry are you telling me you have still NOT put in our original entree order?  He says well, no!  We had by now been here 45 mins.  No aps and no order in!  He tries to explain this promo is being audited and he cannot do anything about it.  OK great.  Why are we still chatting and not getting food?  I got up and promptly left to go to Famous Daves.  Food-1/2 price and the place was PACKED and we still waited no time for really great food.\nMind you-I have been to Firebirds many times and have never been impressed with service but, this took the cake.  The food has always been good though.  What a shame!"
"1","Overall, not really impressed. Yet another example of how service can ruin a dining experience.\n\nCame here on Valentine's day with my boyfriend (we're a younger couple, but old enough to purchase alcohol). Immediately upon being seated, the server was terribly rude and standoffish presumably because he assumed we were younger than we looked and because we didn't immediately purchase alcohol. He made extremely snide remarks when he took our order, and was very short with us. What was even more frustrating was that we could see the difference in his demeanor towards us and towards the group that was sitting  at the table in front of us (that had a much larger tab). He didn't bother to check up on us during the entire meal service, and three different servers brought us drink refills. \n\nThe food was decent. Compared to similar style restaurants, it really didn't blow any place out of the water. It was just very average. I got a burger cooked rare, and it came out just as I requested. Like I said, though: average. We left considerably upset. \n\nA few days later, I was still bothered by the incident. We decided to call the manager to inform him of the way his employee had treated us. As someone who has worked in the food industry before, I understand the importance of customer service and I figured the manager should know about the quality service his employees are exhibiting. The manager was very apologetic and professional about the situation, but to be honest, I'm not completely sure I would return. \n\nThis could have been a three-star review for average food and professional management, but when your night gets tainted by terrible service, there isn't much room for negotiation (in my opinion)."
"4","love the food"
"3","Came here for my sisters birthday dinner. It was a good time. My sister got the coconut shrimp dinner with a side lobster tail. She said it was all great.\n\nMy other sister got some kind of a chicken dinner with mashed potatoes. Her potatoes had cold spots throughout them but she said the chicken was good.\n\nI got the prime rib and it had the potential to be good but it was cooked to well. I told our waiter that I liked it really pink and he said to order it medium then. It came with no pink but it was tender along the outside. The middle was dry and chewy. The horseradish cream was really really good. \n\nI will give this place another try but I would send my dinner back next time if they did not cook the meat how I asked. I'm sure if I had said something they would have taken care of it. When your out to dinner for a celebration you just don't want anything to spoil it though."
"2","So I've admitted in the Biltmore location's review that I secretly LOVE Cheesecake Factory, but this particular location stinks.  \n\nLunch is always busy, and service (up to now) was so-so.  But most recently my co-workers took me to lunch here for my birthday, and here is how the exchange with our 22 year old skanky server went. I swear I am not making this up.  We place our orders and then my co-workers call over our server.  Let's call the 22 year old skanky server Tammy McSleazerston.\n\nCo-workers:  (point over at me like I'm not there, as if to request some kind of retarded ice cream, song and dance freebie) It's his birthday today, could we have some kind of something for him.\nTM:  (In baby voice, and taking her index finger and pointing at her right cheek) Aww, is it your boothday tuhday Mishtuh Man??\nMe:  (Stunned, and not knowing what to say)  Um yeah.\nTM says she'll be back, and walks away.\nMe and Co workers:  (Look at each other jaw-dropped)\n\nWe finish lunch, they give me my stupid ice cream, and we leave a crappy tip and a note to the manager to rein in his flippant servers -- and no apology, or other response."
"2","my boyfriend has wanted to take me to this restaurant for 3 years. we finally went on a special occasion. i was looking forward to a really good meal and nice ambiance. ok, so the food was way overpriced for what you got. we went for breakfast. the portion was average, nothing spectacular and it was pricey for what you got. the service was super slow. yes, it was busy, however, it was slower then slow. it was very noisy, putting a damper on our special occasion. the decor was the only nice thing about the visity. service blew. prices blew. nothing special. i could've went to a hole in the wall diner and got a heaping portion for less money and better service."
"3","If you're not familiar with the Cheesecake Factory, the name should imply that their menu is full of flavorful high-calorie offerings. But it may not imply so well that this place is rather expensive-- on the border of outlandishly.\n\nHowever, their menu is extremely robust, I don't think I can recall another restaurant with so many different things on their menu. Their cheesecake is outstanding, of course, but some of their other menu items can be hit or miss. (For example, their Buffalo Blasts are not as good as they sound, but everything else we tried was rather decent)\n\nIt's a good place to go for a special occasion, I can't really say don't go-- but for the same (or less) money I can get higher quality at other places."
"1","Average to poor food. I've had orange chicken, a salad, and chicken enchiladas. They all sucked. They all cost more then they should have."
"4","Super cool bar, friendly staff and very comfortable environment. Drinks and food are both very affordable and delish. Great happy hour specials too. It's s small establishment so it can get busy. But it's always fun no matter what."
"2","I really hate their food. Everything is disgusting. The wings, the shrimp, the oysters, EVERYTHING. We went there and I love fish and chips so I ordered it. One bite and I was done. It was awful. Puke worthy awful. I ended up only eating the curly fries that came with it. Anyway, the manager noticed I didn't eat any of it, so he decided to take it off our bill which was super nice. It was one star food, but because the manager was nice enough to acknowledge the fact that I didn't like it so I shouldn't have had to pay for it, was why they got another star. Way to go on customer service!"
"5","It's a good thing that this place is not closer to where I live or I would weigh 400 pounds."
"5","We bought a couple of party trays for my birthday and I have to say, it can feed a whole battalion. Not only was there a lot of food, it was also delicious, as usual. Thank you, Greek Wraps!"
"4","When we used to live in Peoria, we would go to Greek Wraps about once a week. Their hummus is to die for. I've actually never had anything less than terrific there. Everything from the veggie pita wrap with grilled eggplant and onions smothered with their special yogurt sauce to their grilled lemon kebab with garlic sauce is amazing. \n\nThere is always a line at Greek Wraps and expect a wait. The food is made fresh to order and the portions are plentiful. \n\nI wish they had delivery!"
"5","The food is amazing here. I've been here a few times and love it every time. I ordered the gryro platter and it comes with a Greek salad and rice. I have to say everything was delicious."
"4","So yummy! I get 1 gyro and order an extra pita. They put enough meat in 1 that you can split into 2!"
"4","A Geico customer hit our car and was responsible.  Geico sent us to Larry Miller in Glendale. (I really wanted to go to Moore in Glendale)    I was told by Geico to call and get an appointment time.  I was amazed at the fine  reception.  Upon arrival, a Geico man met me and checked the damage.  All of 10 minutes and one cup of comp coffee.  He sent me over to the on-site Enterprise and Geico, as promised, took care of my rental car (However, Enterprise was slow as hell in having the promised car available - couldn't even find the Geico request????).\nSo this is 4 stars for Geico and Miller!\nMy only complaint - the repair took 10 working days - most of which was waiting for parts.  My car was very driveable.  So why did I have to leave my own car and drive the very poor Enterprise Car?\nBTW, 2 stars for the Enterprise portion!"
"3","The prices are a little high and the food is ok. I have had better pizza. The wings where also ok. The people where nice both times we have eaten there."
"2","I ordered lasagna, dinner salad and soup.  The Italian wedding soup tasted just like Italian dressing.  It used to be so good. I was so disappointed in it that I saved it for a week to get a refund since I only took two bites but never found the time to take it in and deal with the manager I spoke to that seemed hesitant to provide a refund vs. a replacement product. All the herby delicious flavor was gone and sweet, sweet, sweet took over. Don't they know not to mess with a good thing. Either they changed the recipe or they have a lazy cook.\n\nThe lasagna was good but also really sweet. The portion for the price was disappointing. For that much money, I will just make a pan at home and freeze some portions.  \n\nThe dinner salad was fantastic. Full of yummy, crispy veggies. If the lettuce had been drained and the dressing didn't come out of a bottle with so much sugar it could gag you, I would get that salad twice a week. \n\nI won't be returning for anything BUT the salad, and only if I have my own dressing.\n\nBummer update."
"3","I came here on Saturday on a second hand store rummage day out with my husband and I just have to say that I don't get it, Savers.  \n\nI. Don't. Get. It.\n\nFirst let me start by pointing out something that you guys may have forgotten, you are a secondhand store, not a resale store for gently used merchandise or even a consignment shop.  There *is* a difference.  Your stuff is no nicer than a standard Goodwill's stuff, yet you think you can command about twice the price for your stuff??   Uh, no.\n\nYeah, it's clean and organized in comparison to a Goodwill, but it still smells like my grandma's closet, or maybe even my musty garage after a humid day.  Why?  Because it's STILL a secondhand store, full of unwashed goods, of questionable provenance, from other people.\n\nI found a wall mounted coat rack that I really liked and would have purchased, but it was $10.   Uh, sorry, but that isn't that awesome of a deal.  And my husband found some well loved, North Face snow pants that would have been a good deal for something slightly less than the $25 they wanted for them, AND if they hadn't also been ripped at the bottom so I would have had to mend them anyway...  c'mon Savers, really?\n\nAdding to all this is the fact that they weren't even offering any kind of point of sale discount, coupons, nothing...  At least Goodwill was running a 50% off everything deal that same day.  I did hear an overhead announcement that said that if you register online with Savers and give them your email address they'll send you coupons, but who really wants Spam from a secondhand store?  I certainly don't.  I much prefer a point of sale discount that requires no sharing of my personal contact information, thankyouverymuch.\n\nSaver's whether you guys like it or not, Goodwill IS your competition, so you better step up your game to actually compete with them.  I'll be clear, I'm not cheap and I'd like to consider myself a bit of a connoisseur of the secondhand stores across the Valley (hell, I was raised shopping in secondhand stores) but I refuse to pay those kinds of prices for that kind of merchandise.  \n\nYou guys need to reexamine your pricing structure because it kinda sucks."
"3","\""I am a way picky Mex eater partially because I had the luxury of growing up with real authentic mex food thanks to my grandparent's. My mother in law has to go here every time she visits AZ which I always am ehhh about Abuelos nothing special about the food just the atmosphere really =-o The chips and salsa are very good thin crispy not greasy, perfect really.So this last time we went was THE last time I go there PERIOD. My MIL even said she remembered the food being better, while it was never a big deal for me.\n\nIt was my daughter's b-day. The service was awful! The server was Russian she couldnt understand much of anything. We had 2 toddlers with us and ordered 1 kid's plate for them to share well she brought 2 anyway and when we explained once again only 1 was ordered she was going to take plate #2 back and throw it in the bin, we then told her nevermind we'd keep the plate instead of wasting food for her mistake. We had the seared tuna starter pretty good and unexpected and something you dont see too often at mexican. I had the tortilla soup it was not good I have had 100x better from Red Robin, it didnt have any tortilla in it I asked what the deal was. She said it comes with a side of crunchy tort strips she had forgotten to bring out. I had the Green Chile con Chicken quesadilla - the chicken to be safe. I had a Mojito it was under their signature cocktails, it was the worst I have ever had anywhere\"" I sent it back wanting more cool mint taste she took forever but there was no change in my drink I left it untouched. We were a party of 6 no one was too happy with their dinner the kid's loved their chicken nuggets but they are kid's and love mcd's. We got the bill and were still charged for the horrible mojito and 2nd kids plate that was not ordered but would have gone in the bin. They did however concauct some desert for my daughter which she loved and was free maybe because her bday!?!?! Who know's but I won't be going back!"
"4","Have been here to dine a few times. and went for happy hour on a friday night.  Very decent prices and the food is great. The place was busy but we are able to belly up to the bar. Will be back for sure."
"4","I am hemming and hawing about 3 or 4 stars.  I'm going to go with 4 because I have had so many bad dining experiences at chains lately.  This, obviously, was not one of the bad ones.  \n\nFirst, let me say thank you to Abuelos for having a decent happy hour (gasp, seven days a week).  The drinks are priced great and there is a large variety of food at very low prices.  Second, this place was packed when we went in.  It was either sneak into a seat at the bar or wait 30 minutes.  We chose the bar.  The service was very fast and attentive despite the crowd.  Third, and finally, the food was genuinely good.  The ingredients were fresh, the salsas were flavorful, the chips light and crispy and it was all presented nicely. \n\nI know that normally decent food, served properly by people who are attentive should not be that big of a deal but, lately I have a hard time finding even the basics.  It was very nice to go out, order something interesting and be served the food just as it should be."
"2","Fancy place.  Not great food. \n\nThis place is a fancy, expensive Mexican restaurant for people what to spend more money than they should and get far less than good Mexican food.  I guess if you're from Minnesota, Wisconsin or BC this is passible, but it is far from good Mexican food."
"5","Great service, lots of tasty options spinach enchiladas were delicious also chips and salsa they give you are great, the green salsa is my favorite! Will be back to try more."
"2","Two stars just because the chips and salsa are good. But everything else was horrific. It tasted like frozen crap, covered with velveeta cheese. Rice has no flavor and the refried beans were oddly crusty. We will never go back."
"3","Good food (if \""good\"" can be associated with fast food) - but the drive-thru here is one of the slowest I have used.\n\nYou come to fast food and a drive-thru for a QUICK and easy meal. The easy part they did.. the quick part turned into a 15 min wait from order to eating. Way to long in my opinion."
"3","Whataburger has a decent burger, but is definitely not one of my favorite places even for fast food. This location hasn't been too busy on the few occasions that I have dined here though, so it has been quick and convenient for me."
"1","First time ever there!!!  Ordered a salad with apples and cranberries among other things...no apples in the salad..what's the point of paying extra for a salad if you are not getting what is supposed t o be in it??  Never again!  I hate rip offs!!!  P.s.  Their french fries suck...my husband ordered them and their hamburgers were not even thick!"
"1","worst return policy in the world!\neven with a receipt! be careful if you do a partial payment with a gift card!!\n\nExperience 1 - I purchased Nip/Tuck season whatever ($40), a sweater ($28) and the Black Eyed Peas cd ($12) online from target.com. I paid mostly with my debit card, but I had used the last $9 of a gift card as well.\nI printed the order confirmation everything showed exactly as I ordered it. I get my items and instead of the Black Eyed Peas Cd I get the Nip Tuck soundtrack. I go to return it to the store. I can'y because althought they carry the cd, that portion of the order was fulfilled by amazon.com NOT target.com. So I bought the cd there in store and called target to find out about returning it for a refund and a credit on the shipping. They would only refund the cd to the gift card and no refund on shipping since the nip tuck soundtrack was on the invoice, it must be my mistake even though my order confirmation shows no signs of the nip tuck sndtrk. When I read them their own return policy stating simply that refunds will be credited to the original form of payment and since the cd was priced higher than the value of the gift card the refund should be credited to my debit card. The representative then lead me to a SECOND return policy that was similar but stated that the entire amount would be refunded to the gift card since i used a target gift card for a portion of the payment. Now to get to this second refund, I had to type the URL into the address bar of my browser. The rep was unable to tell me how to navigate to it from their site. There were no links to get to it. It was a static page that required you to type the address in manually. How would I have ever known that??\n\nExperience2 - I purchased some nice metal shower curtain hooks ($16). They kept catching on the shower rod tho as the rod was too thick around. I went to return them. I had no receipt and I paid cash. My fault.  I went to exchange it for a $65 mirror which I was told I cannot do since I didn't have the receipt I could only exchange it for something of equal or greater value (the mirror was greater) and from the same department. IT WAS FROM THE SAME STORE WHO THE FUCK CARES WHAT DEPARTMENT IT WAS FROM??\nOh and I couldn't get store credit I had to use it that same day."
"2","This would have been a 5 star review, but they charged me an extra $20 after check out for no reason! They asked for a credit card when I checked in, \""Just to have on file for incidentals...it won't be charged.\"" At least that's what I was told! There isn't any incidentals to be had at this hotel. No mini bar, no snacks in the room, and no drinks in the fridge. So what was the charge for? I used my own soap and lotion, and even paid double for some drinks and snacks at the snack bar downstairs...it just aggravates me. My friend stayed at the same time in a different room and was also charged the $20 after check out, so beware since it must be standard here!"
"4","You can rarely go wrong here.\n\nLove the chips & salsa!\n\nHave become a big fan of Boneless Buffalo Chicken Salad!"
"4","Love the outdoor patio!  The perfect venue for relaxing with music and a cold beer."
"2","My mouth has a weird aftertaste. It could of been the cockroach that scurried across the floor and ended up in my burger. Free wings on Monday night football. That's cool. \nCheap beer. They raised over$1,000 for a nonprofit one night for local teens in need of help. That's cool. We are in Wickenburg"
"3","I work in Wickenburg so the options for food are limited. I do enjoy the chicken Parmesan plate or sandwich here. The Greek salad is tasty too, but overpriced a bit. I call in my order ahead of time and its usually ready to go by the time I get there. The people are always helpful and friendly. It doesn't get more stars because I don't have much to compare it to in town, I'm a spoiled city girl who is used to a higher level of restaurant, and I've only tried a couple things so I'm not able to give a complete review with a higher rating."
"1","This was a brightly lit place with a trailer feel that had table clothes on tables that filled a plain rectangular single room.  There was plenty of help running around ignoring the four of us for a bit and then the excitement started when we ordered and was told how many things they did not have like bacon, cheddar cheese and the like.  It was a \""steak place\"" and they proved it by charging between $25 and $37.  We had a bad enough feeling about the place and didn't chance that by just ordering hamburgers and fries and with a drink each that came to $31.  Flavor probably would have been extra.  Go anywhere also."
"5","Great food.  Very clean.  If you have special dietary needs they are able to accommodate just ask nicely.  Try them you won't be diss appointed."
"3","Stopped by this Subway on the drive back home to Vegas from Phoenix.  It is conveniently located on the right side of the road heading to Vegas.\n\nI ordered a 6\"" BMT w/Jalapeno Cheddar Bread & had it toasted.  I added Tomatoes, Lettuce, Green Peppers, Pepperoncinis, Mustard, Mayo, Oil, Vinegar, Salt, Pepper.  They made it quickly and I was eating in no time.\n\nThe ingredients were very fresh and the Sandwich tasted great.  A nice snack for the ride home.\n\nA bonus is the clean restrooms....a quick tip is to stop here to use the restroom instead of a nasty gas station....every gas station in Wickenberg was busy with travelers using the restrooms.\n\nWill I return?  Next time I drive to/from Phoenix, I will."
"1","This subway has terrible service. The food is just ok and the space is not well kept."
"1","Food was bland.  Service was slow.  Screwed up my bill - chased me down in the parking lot to get me to come back to pay more."
"5","This is perhaps the BEST chinese food I have ever had.  Everywhere I go I try the local chinese food restaurants.  I have lived in Orlando, Pearl Harbor, Charleston, Seattle, Guam, Flint, near Flagstaff, and now near WIckenburg.\n\nNo one seems to do from scratch egg rolls anymore, not positive these are from scratch but if they are not they are exquisite nontheless.  The crab angels are awesome as well and if you get any of the dinner for 2 combinations you get 1 for each person & soup.   The egg drop soup is blah, but not terrible.\n\nThe chicken dishes that are supposed to be crunchy, are crunchy.  The dishes that are supposed to be spicy, are spicy without being overpowering.   My significant other cant have things too hot, and she enjoyed our spicy dishes.\n\nOnly been here twice.  The food was awesome both times.  The manager/owner was very cordial to us, but did seem on very friendly terms with what we assume were regulars.  Joking and kidding with them.  If they were not regulars, then the interactions would seem quite hostile.  She made me and my fiancee seem like special guests, perhaps even friends of the her family.\n\nOnly thing I have to complain about is the bathrooms.  You have to exit the building.  The bathrooms are not airconditioned, in the summer in AZ that can be quite hot!"
"5","Stopped here today on my way through town on the recommendation of a friend and was glad I did. Had the corned beef hash Anita style and it was awesome! Delicious corned beef hash kicked up with jalapenos. If you like spicy and you like corned beef you will love it! I got it served with some corn tortillas and salsa on the side. Was the best breakfast i have had this month. \nService here was also over the top, they kept my coffee cup full and I really needed it this morning since i had to get up at 4am today. \n\nI'll definitely be back here next time I go through Wickenberg"
"5","There is a reason why this was voted as the best place to stop on a road trip by AZ Highway magazine.  Deb the owner is great and takes you back to a time where things were a little slower and personable.\n\nThere is nothing on the menu that you could go wrong with but the \""El Burro\"" is definitely a favorite when I'm not in the mood for the world-class biscuits and gravy...and yes when she says you really should order the half-portion, she means it."
"3","It's a Taco Bell and Pizza Hut Express combo, what more could you really ask for?!"
"4","ShooGoo was sort of a template 4-star place: good food, American menu, big ole portions, and nice service. It lacked the special zsa zsa zsu needed for 5 starrs.\n\nMy filet with B\u00e9arnaise sauce was excellent. The highlight of our meal, however, was our mushroom with Gorgonzola appetizer. Mmm.\nAnd, of course, they have the nice view, though that was pretty pervasive throughout Sedona.\nsunny az... yow, bill"
"3","Food was absolutely delicious,  but pricey. We were dressed in comfortable clothing (jeans/shorts/sweatshirts) and clearly did not fit in; this is a dressy crowd. We were also the youngest people there... it was mostly older adults 65+. Great views and good service."
"5","We went here again after discovering this great restaurant last time we visited Sedona.  Not only does it have a great sunset view of the beautiful  Thunder mountain but it has fabulous food.  The wait staff is very friendly & professional too.  Both the rack of lamb that I had and the scallops that my husband had were delicious.  The portions are generous and the meals come with soup or salad, hot bread, vegetable and rice or potato. It's a must try when visiting Sedona."
"2","McDonald's will be McDonald's so I've based my review on service alone. cashier had no personality. He didn't smile or even was interested on working. He looked and sounded miserable taking my order. The manager on the other hand gave me my food with a smile and even cracked a joke. it was a morning shift so that employee needs to cheer up and smile more and spread positive vibes especially when people are just starting their day."
"2","Every time I play here something makes me angry. Today was slowness. Usually it's service and miserable people but today all staff I encountered were very nice. We played 13 holes in 3 hours and waited at least 5 minutes if not more per hole. Don't go here if you want to play a quick round and don't use the vending machine on the 4th hole. Wasted half my day waiting so we just left. I will say the greens were in excellent shape which is why I gave 2 stars not 1! I am a self proclaimed golf snob so I may be a little bit dramatic but when I pay $30 and barely get through half a round, this is what I have a problem with."
"2","As another reviewer mentioned, this location is notorious for having out of date items on the shelves. \nI have purchased numerous items that were out of code without noticing.\nWhen you are shopping for a whole week's with of groceries, or in a rush, it is difficult to check the date on every item you pick up and put in your cart (not to mention that the store is responsible for pulling items that are expired for consumer safety).\n\nThe store seems to be cutting back recently as well, and this doesn't bode well for the already sub par service. \nIt means waiting in longer lines, as well as being forced to use the self checkout because only one(or two at most) regular checkstand is ever open."
"2","I didn't think it was very good. We got the chicken fried rice, paper wrapped chicken, shrimp pad thai & sesame chicken - none of which was really good. The fried rice was horrible. I don't know why this place is so busy."
"2","It's just ok.  At first, the food tasted pretty good, but as we settled into the meal we found it to be quite greasy.  In fact, my wife got sick from the meal while I only had an upset stomach.  I think we'll have to find another place."
"2","I am writing this litterally as I eat a piece of their pie. I can not get why people find thing place so good for pie. The chocolate Satin is a little salty and the crust breaks a little too easily for my taste. But you cant expect much I guess since they do not make pies in house.\nStick with small bakeries ."
"5","I went in to John Mario's a bit skeptical - you never know what you're going to get with any given hair salon. This was the first time I'd had my hair cut in Vegas, so I went completely off of online reviews (like this one). \n\nI requested a fairly challenging hair cut from my barber, Bill. I pulled up a photo of the style I liked on my phone and showed it to him. After studying it and talking it through with me, Bill went straight to work. Watching him work with the clippers was absolutely mesmerizing - you can tell the guy is a pro. I watched in awe as he shaped my raggedy mop into a style nearly identical to the photo I had showed him just 20 minutes earlier. The end result FAR exceeded my expectations! \n\nNeedless to say, I highly recommend John Mario's - especially Bill. He's as talented with a pair of scissors and clippers as I've seen, and he can absolutely create the exact look you want."
"3","I came here with my mom to order take out because she really likes this place. I already have a place to eat Chinese, but she was driving. The place was clean. They have pictures of food up, but I couldn't tell what any of them were. \n\nThe service was good. I had a Sprite from the fountain, or what I thought was a Sprite. When I took a sip it was not Sprite. I told the guy at the counter and he said ok and made no effort to check the machine. Then I tried the Lemonade. That was water. When I went to pour it out, there were floaties of I don't know what in my cup. I sat down thinking they would get to the machine, but they didn't. \n\nThey have lunch specials that go till 4p.  Unfortunately, we had gone in the evening, so I'm not sure of the portions they serve, but their prices are reasonable and about the same as other restaraunts. \n\nI had Udon soup which was good. At the same time unappetizing because I kept thinking about the machine. I'm all about supporting small businesses, but first impression is key."
"3","After reading the reviews for this place me and my roommate decided to stop by for lunch. The lunch specials are priced very nicely (6 bucks) and the portions are filling. The service was choppy but the woman had her hands full with her baby girl. I would come back."
"3","My Grandma was looking for a good Chinese take-out place nearby, so we checked out this place, based on the Yelp! reviews. My Grandma got the Lemon Chicken and really enjoyed it. I ordered the Panang Curry with Chicken. I asked them to make it hot (9 of 10). I didn't really like the taste, it wasn't very hot & the consistency was strange. I've had Panang at several restaurants & this was some of the worst, unfortunately. The service was adequate, so I'll probably try it again, but I'll be ordering something else instead."
"5","Great environment and great price. Ask for Zulma or Rachel. Zulma can do a killer fade."
"2","Very poor service at the jewelry counter...I stood there 5 minutes before the clerk \""Sammy\"" even acknowledged my presents. He was walking around the store talking to co-workers. A simple \""I'll be with you in a moment\"" would be a big plus! When he finally did come over to help me he wasn't very knowledgeable about his own merchandise. But he did have very fresh minty breath though...just saying."
"3","Pretty good pizza.  This place isn't far from my house, so I'll probably go back.  Not as good as my beloved Grimaldi's, but it's plenty good for the price."
"4","My parent's love this place and now, so do I.  It is New York Style pizza (thinner crust and longer slices) very much like we got back home in NY.  Dont let their prices deceive you as it is pretty good!"
"3","Good food. It takes a little bit longer for them to make the sandwiches because they freshly slice the meat & cheese, but no complaint there, it's fresh and tastes way better than subway. They are limited on the veggies they offer, would like to have cucumber and bell peppers available.  I really like their mayo/mustard mix."
"5","I love this Port of Subs! The staff is very friendly and make me feel at home. Everything is very neat and clean and I always get what i want. I have been going here for several years now and the staff changes pretty often but everyone is always nice. I would recommend this place over any other locations."
"4","Well I'm leaving the hotel tomorow morning so I guess I'm technically still a guest, but oh well haha.\n\nBeds are pretty comfortable, the shower has decent room and water pressure [I hate when hotel showers just drip, it's annoying n difficult], n my only complaint is that they have the cheapest toilet paper is the world--wtf is that about?\n\nTo get to the pool, get in the side entrance, n use the elevators requires your room key. Kinda weird in my opinion but I guess that's a good idea so random people can't just wander into the hotel or pool area. So safety-wise, a plus.\n\nOh, n there's a Starbucks on the Casino floor sooooo there are NO coffee pots in the hotel rooms and NO refrigerators. Kinda random. At least you have one of those ice cups if you wanna run down the hall to get ice for an ice chest or somethin.\n\nBuffet style eating here is pretty good. They have a whole section for sugar-free deserts if you're concerned about that kinda thing. The buffet line is split into each type of food: Asian, Americana, Mexican, n Dessert!\n\nOur hotel room was on a non-smoking floor which was nice. But there are also floors that allow smoking.....but if you smoke on a non-smoking floor there's a sign that says there will be a $100 violated fee haha so don't do it.\n\nThe pool in the back area of the hotel is about three feet deep but it's designed pretty cool almost like the edge overflows kinda like a fountain.\n\nHooter's, Regal Cinema's, n a bowling alley are attached to the hotel/casino. There's plenty of places around like Walmart n Target or Walgreen's to go get anything you might need outside of the hotel close by. Convenience is always great.\n\nOverall, it's a good place to stay. Good for families n whoever else wants to stay. Oh n by the way, the downstairs casino area is decorated like it's outdoors---reminded me of an old Disneyland ride lol fake sky n etc!"
"2","I'm rating this a three star for my overall experience with this casino in general. The first time I've ever been here was just for the buffet. The BF said he's come here since a child with his family and they had the \""best\"" buffet. EH, yea, I'm sure it was back in the days!! It was mediocre. The reason why I'm giving it a three star instead of a one or two is because they had these two amazing ladies who helped us sign up for their rewards program. They were so attentive yet not pushy like the other \""younger\"" strip casino waitresses. \n\nBesides all of the above, I would not stay at this hotel again. I only stayed in Vegas for one night, it was cheap, but saving the extra $40 wasn't worth it. The bed was HARD, the room service and front desk people were not friendly whatsoever. I mean, what happened to those two ladies a year ago?! They also never explained what the room charges were. There were two different taxes, the $14.99 amenity charge which were DID NOT use - asked them if they could waive it because their WIFI didn't even work!! it was SLOWER THAN A SNAIL..... \n\nOH their shower head leaks and sprays water EVERYWHERE and if you didn't know what the hell to do, you're basically SOL (you had to turn the shower head left and right so stop the spraying. As for LADIES, beware, they have the worse lighting to do make up - it's a incandescent light which makes it yellow, but it was the worse one ever to where, you couldn't even tell if your foundation/powder blended well, so that was a total bummer to go out without knowing if my make up was ok or not. \n\nThe only reason why we really take this 20 min drive out this way, is because we like the outside environment. It makes it feel like you're home because the grocery store, CVS, local restaurants are all down the same street. Beats spending a fortune for one meal. \n\nAlthough, I wish they had a microwave/fridge in their deluxe rooms. EH, like I mentioned before, this was a BUST. Will not stay here again..AND I change my mind, it's now a 2 instead of a 3. That's how sad I am about this place. Such a disappointment."
"2","(My fiancee and I stayed here 3 1/2 weeks ago. I'm just going to be brief and go over the pros and cons of the place because it was nice, but not \""great\""; we'll probably stay here again if we can't find a better option-)\n\nCons:\n\n1.The Weather: \n\nBe warned! Vegas is a *desert*: We went in May thinking it's be cool-ish and mild-ish: It wasn't!! It was very muggy (It rained) and very, very windy-felt like the inside of a hairdryer every time we went outside; the hot, high winds (Gusts up to 60+ mph) made \""walking the strip\"" very unenjoyable. Our bad and we'll more than likely not go there between the months of May-August next time, but still; I hate being cramped up inside! :/\n\n2. Our Trip (Cut Short due to the Weather): 2 stars off\n\nMy fiancee and I were booked here for 4 days but ended up leaving a day early due to inclement weather. I know it's not fair of me to take a couple of stars off, but we had really been looking forward to relaxing poolside and getting a cabana each day, only to find the pool open only 1 day out of what would've been 4: Blah. :/\n\n3. The Weird WIFI and \""Fine Print Resort Fee\"" Charges: 1 star off\n\nAdditionally, they have this Game that they play where they \""say\"" you get \""Free WIFI\"" in your Room but you're charged the fee for it and it's \""taken\"" out of your Resort Fee at the end...something like a charge-back it was explained to us..Yeah, okay, sure sounds shady...BUT I want to clearly state that after looking over our statement after our Trip, we were charged-back the WIFI fees..but we had this nagging, in-the-background-uncomfortable, \""will they charge it back or not\"" feeling, which put a small damper on our enjoyment. I also think that they should've been way, way more \""upfront\"" about the Resort Fee vs. making it a \""fine print\"" item that you kind've..discover upon checking in. :/\n\nPros:\n\n1. The Oyster Bar: Pretty decent, I've had better, but not bad for Vegas.\n\n2. No nasty smoke smell\n\n3. Clean, quite rooms (Albeit slightly worn down)\n\nAll in all, my fiancee adores this Casino and wants to stay here again. Me, not so much; there's plenty of other places to stay that I'd like to check out..."
"4","I totally love Station Casinos!  Bowling alley, movie theater, and gambling all in one place.  What a concept! \n\nSunset Station is in a great location surrounded by a ton of shopping so sometimes we find ourselves just stopping in.  \n\nWe came by with my folks who were visiting and my mother, who will only gamble on ONE type of slot machine lol, stopped an employee to asked if they had any of this machine.  She went out of her way to walk my mother to the other side of the casino to the slot machine she was looking for.  Knowing that I was a local (my mother told her) she asked if she could sign my parents up for their own Boarding Passes so that I could get credit for it under mine. She took each of their ID's, walked away for less than 5 minutes, and came back with their cards.  That was really nice and I got extra points for them signing up... \n\nThe casino (and bathrooms) always seem clean, albeit a little smokey, so I knocked a star off for that.  But otherwise I really like visiting this place!"
"5","This is a great hotel. They have an awesome pool. It is in a good location. The maids are always nice and clean the rooms well. The rooms are nice and comfortable. I have come here with my family 3 times and it has always been great."
"3","Older hotel, but fairly clean.  Just needs some TLC.  Staff and security friendly, restaurants have good food.  Service good.  Games are decent and I didn't feel like my $60 spent on gaming went too fast.  I enjoyed myself.  I'd probably stay here again.  Their $35/night is, of course, loaded up with resort fees, incidental fees, security fees, and taxes.  The cost to stay here is only pennies lower than non-casino hotels.  Just another piece of information."
"3","OK, so check this out.  I know I have been long dormant with the Yelp reviews (bad girl, BAD GIRL!), so to make it up to ya'll, I am now embarking on a casino-by-casino tour of my new hometown of LV, NV, and will include reviews of each as I tour them.  Now, these will not include room stays, but just schlepping around the premises - eating, drinking, and checking out anything that moves or doesn't move.  Got it? OK, let's proceed...\n\nReview #10:\nway out east in Henderson; definitely catering to the locals & elderly, with miles & miles of slot machines, plus a huge bingo room, a 13-screen movie theater, and a massive 72-lane bowling alley; the kiddos are also accomodated with multiple arcades & an amusement rides area; the hotel portion is really set off to the side, so much so that I didn't even realize there were hotel rooms here initially; nice motif throughout the casino, especially the faux-balconies near the restaurants; they also have a very nice & quite large sports book that invites lingering; restaurant & bar choices are pretty basic, but the Oyster Bar is a cut above; overall, would have given them 3.5 stars if I could; best craft beer bet = the Oyster Bar for sure, which recently added about 10 good beers in bottles"
"3","One of the older station casinos I enjoy going to. It's close to my house which makes it a sought after place for gambling, eating or bowling. Parking never seems to be an issue since there are lots around the entire casino and a decent sized parking garage.\n\nThe eateries are nothing spectacular in my opinion. I have tried a few places but never returned with all of the other options in the area. I will find myself having a small bite in the \"" cafeteria \"" are with fast food options for a quick or to go meal.\n\nI mainly come here to play the slot or bingo from time to time. I like the layout of the slot machines and the fact that they are not right on top of one another. Being so close to where I live I will come back from time to time but I usually drive a little further to GVR for my local place to play."
"3","Overall this is a pretty good place. It's located off the strip so it seemed to be a more local crowd. We ate at the buffet which was very good as far as casino buffets go. It had a variety of food, all of which was pretty good. \n\nThe place also has a 72 lane bowling alley, arcade, and kid area."
"2","I came to the buffet for salad. They had spinach and good dressings.  I was pleased with my salad. Anything else on the buffet looked like it was 20 years old. Dry gross and gross.  However, the crowd didn't seem to be starving -- at all.  So no one missed a calorie and I guess all is well that ends well."
"4","Besides the gym, the mall is probably my second favorite place to get my exercise on. Well, that is before I sabotage it with carby goodness. The food court is filled with pitfalls waiting to snag it's next victim. Auntie Anne's would not be so bad until you see them brush a generous application of butter on top. \n\nWith such a critical opinion of their practice, why would I give them such a high rating? Sometimes counting calories and nitpicking is a buzz kill. The cinnamon sugar pretzel is the answer to a sweet tooth. The pepperoni twist is like having all crust with pieces of meat. Some of the more popular items are made ahead of time, but I was told it would take six minutes for mine. Maybe the pizza inspired bread does not sit well and I am glad to have it come out fresh."
"1","CLOSED!  AND THE BIG SLIDES REMOVED??\n\nNot sure what is going on here, looks to be some renovations I'll be totally bummed if they lose the big slides."
"2","In short I would REALLY like to shove my broken ass foot up this UMC's bungholio. Maybe I'm just brusque because I am in no better shape than I was before this visit. Nope, UMC just sucks.\n\nNo Radiologist on site to read my x-rays.....so who read them? Better yet, who did I pay to read them? Maybe it was the manager's daughter in her early 20s in a Walmart sundress who sounded like she was on Oxycontin and just smoked ten packs of cigs. I love when I am at these places and hear such random conversations I shouldn't be hearing. \n\n2nd. I can barely walk. Yes, it's my fault I'm such a clutz. The doctor says it's severly sprained and throws me a script for Tylenol with Codeine and has a nurse wrap my foot and tells me to go buy a cane or my own brace. WTF?! She also says it may be fractured, but I need to see a Podiatrist to find out for sure, oh and I can't workout for 8-10 weeks........Why did I come here again? Ughhh.\n\nThe TWO STARS is because this bullshit only took me a little over an hour and I was out. We all know that deserves stars. \n\nIf you happen to stumble into my office today I am the cranky one drooling with my swollen foot on the desk watching Facts of Life reruns not doing diddly and possibly sleeping.\n\nDO NOT WAKE THE DRAGON."
"1","I came into this office tonight for an abscess tooth. I have had a few so I know the difference. The pain is unbearable and your gums form a pocket after you have had a cavity for some while. I don't have insurance and I do not have 50 or would've went to a dentist. Let me add I came in for antibiotics, not hard core pills. Let me say this place is horrible! After claiming I have gingivitis from the female doctor on staff at 7:30 at night to not giving me a prescription  because I wouldn't pay 50 is basically holding it hostage. I could understand if I was trying to get Vicodin but an antibiotic? The lady in charge of billing kicked me out! I will be going to the director having a law background I know that UMC has a sign on the wall stating that they will help everyone. What they're forgot at the bottom is anyone with money. By the way already at another hospital and have been seen and what so you know I have an abscess tooth, not gingivitis. You will have to pay a copay if they find you as not an emergency, which gingivitis would be considered as not an emergency. The nurse there who has blonde hair I will be writing the director for her because she belongs in a way better environment. Gingivitis is where all your gums are inflamed and your gums are bleeding."
"3","I have eaten here a few times.  At first I really liked the place, but upon reflection I haven't really had anything great.  The portion sizes are huge and the prices are pretty good.  The combos plates offer a pretty good mix, and the chicken katsu and beef short ribs are pretty tasty.  I had the kalua pork once and it was too salty for my tastes.  I know it's Hawaiian BBQ-style food, but I always wish that whatever I ordered had come with some kind of vegetables.  Just eating meat, rice, and mac salad makes for a really heavy meal."
"4","For the price, it's not a bad deal. I got the wings today. 9 of them plus rice and a small amount of mac salad. I normally get the seafood combo. It comes with mahi mahi, teriyaki chicken, and shrimp. I always tell them to delete the shrimp and give an extra piece of fish. Normally the fish is thick, moist and good. Last time over cooked and dry. The teriyaki chicken always good. The shrimp always horrible. Don't get it. Too thin, too much bread, too dry. Step back from their shrimp. \nAll in all, the chicken always good and the mahi mahi most times good. Not great. But good, and enough of it."
"1","I will NEVER  go back!    The food is good, but over priced!\nThey charge you for drink refills, they charge you for togo containers.  The blinds are broken and nasty, the ceiling fans are nasty.  And then they have the nerve to post a sign no plate picking!  Give me a freaking break!  Make your place upscale , then maybe put a sign up like that!"
"2","I know it was like 4 in the morning, but this place had a slow response time over drive-thru speaker - including unexplained pauses - and ran out of rice for my friend's chicken teriyaki bowl. This means that I'm going to pick a different local Jack in the Box to hit up late at night, such as the one on Mountain Vista and Russell. That place totally did have rice when I drove over there, and it was way faster."
"2","I actually like coming to this location although they can get really busy and the wait times can be long. \nThe servers are friendly ... and who doesn't like to write on the table with a crayon?\nI really enjoy the eggplant parmesan or chicken parmesan- their salad is remarkable and fresh with a lighter dressing than that of Olive Garden.\nFor an Italian Chain Restaurant it is really good. \nThe decor is nice with cafe italian style look. \nDefinitely a fun place for a crowd... or an intimate dinner for TWO.\n\nOk Addendum to the above review : Went here last night on a date. He ordered Chicken Alfredo , I ordered Chicken Parm. I liked my dinner ... did not like the appetizer stuffed mushrooms... (crab is usually not that fishy tasting)\n\nAlso the salad had a funny taste.\n\nMy server was nice ... but he was more interested in flirting with my date than serving us. Also getting a refill on water... Good thing I wasn't dehydrated because ... i had to keep asking.\n\nHe did somewhat make up for it by filling a bag full of bread with our leftovers...\n\nWhatever!\n\nWon't be back for awhile!"
"2","I hate to give 1 star, so 2 will do. \n\nMy boyfriend and I came here for dinner around 6:00 on a Sunday evening, it looked a little busy so the 10 minute wait for a booth sounded great! The manager apologized and I assured him we were fine with that.\n\n \nFirst, the poor hostess was so lost and confused,  she was wondering around looking so stressed out trying to help buss tables, looked like her first job. The busser was no where to be found I only saw him twice the whole night, it almost seemed as if he was washing dishes and didn't have time to buss. The whole night we sat with the last tables dirty cups and dishes stacked above our head at the booth.\n\nSecond, Our bartender was our server so I expected a little wait, no one brought us bread until we asked, and when brought out it was just thrown on the table, no oil was served or anything,  nobody even introduced themselves. Meanwhile,  our order went in at 6:20 at 6:50 our main dish was served, it looked as if it was sitting on the counter for 15 minutes and a little cold, but wasn't to big to complain so we just asked for some extra sauce to moist it back, by 7:10 the extra sauce was delivered as well as our appetizer salads... My boyfriend has order the chicken parmesan,  he asked for bowtie noodles and unfortunately got thick string noodles.\n\nHey my pinapple mojito was delicious!!\n\nFinally, our check was brought out our bartender apologized for the horrible service he knew was served and comped everything from our bill except  our salads, I was thankful.\n\nI wanted to add a server in particular,  unfortunately I do not know his name, but I made sure I went out of my way to thank him for everything because he was the one making sure we ordered, our food was delivered, our condiments were brought out, refilled waters, he basically did everything, defiantly the only one who could hold his composure at a busy rate."
"2","How you gonna call it Macaroni Grill and there isn't any macaroni on the menu, WTF?!? I mean the had deep fried macaroni bites but no macaroni & cheese entrees?!? Seriously?!? Very limited on the vegetarian choices too. The service wasn't bad, wasn't superb either. The only good thing is the two of us got full for $40."
"5","Service was great.  Chicken Parm.  was huge.  Great bread with olive oil and balsamic vinegar, yummy.  Wife had chicken fettuccine alfredo.  She was very happy with it. Good grilled chicken and the sauce was really fresh, clearly house made.  Good Caesar salads too.  Didn't have any wine.  Server advised that they have half price bottles of wine on Thursdays.  Might come back for that.  Kids liked there pasta and pizza too.  Pizza was really good sized.  Good fresh brewed iced tea too.  No complaints."
"4","I got a good haircut and style at a decent price. The girl did what i asked when i showed her a picture. Theres a special right now - 7 foil highlights,cut, dry, waxed brows all for $60!"
"2","This Borders closes very early compared to other stores and is always low on stock.  You can never find anybody to help you find something, but the line is short and the clearance section is nice.  The bathrooms are so-so.  The music selection is great and so are the DVDs."
"2","I used to enjoy the store because they had the best newsstand in the area. I don't know what happened but that is no longer the case. There are a lot of empty spaces and the magazines that are there are out of order. The newsstand is practically unshoppable. It's sad when I can go across the street to Target and get a better selection and more up to date selection of magazines. \n\nIn addition to the poor state of the newsstand they no longer carry music and DVDs. It is also difficult to locate new book releases. You are better off going around the corner to Barnes & Noble."
"3","I got my oil changed in 30 minutes.  It was quick, painless, and I wasn't \""hussled\"".  They mentioned I would want to replace something but they didn't try and force me to do it then and there.  I also got my oil change through groupon so it was nice to see a big company like Midas giving out discounts!"
"5","Love it.  I wish there was one closer to where I live, but rumor has it they are opening up on Eastern @ Horizon Ridge in September. I can't wait.\n\nThey have great prices on everyday cheese, tp & energy bars.\n\nI also love all of their seasoned nuts.  Yummm."
"5","This was my first time stepping foot in a trader joes and it's pretty weird for me. I'm just unfamiliar with a lot of their products and all the organic, grass fed, & natural products. \n\nI'm all about being healthy tho so it's just right I come back and actually shop intensively. For they do offer a lot of things that sparks my interest. \nPlus, all natural, grass fed, bone in ribeye. I will cook n taste u soon!"
"1","I had my excursion detailed here for $65 (Dec 2, 2010). It took them over 2 hours and when I got it back it had dirty patches all over.  Especially in the door jams.  But what is worse, that night the truck was stolen from right in front of my house!  The police and insurance both tell me that car wash staff look for certain cars and when they spot one they want- all they need to do is look at your registration for your address. Further, In the 2 hours they had my car it would even possible for them to create a duplicate key and transponder.  If I had another car, I'd never take it back there again!"
"1","No longer a hand car wash place. I had to drive my own car through. (Guess I have to try the 7 Hills hand car wash place.) This place still has great greeting cards, though!"
"1","Not good.\n\nFirst, beware of the scammer who's gonna greet you and ask you if you were interested in fixing \""the chips' on your windshield.\n\nThen, are you interested in paying +$15 for a car wash that doesn't bother cleaning your cup holder or empty your car's ashtray?\n\nLastly, even their express car wash machine is terrible. It left deep scratches and swirls on my car.\n\nThe owners should save their dignity and close this place or consider giving customers better service."
"1","Brought my dogs in here twice. First time I brought my dogs in to stay here for a week, when I picked them up one was limping. Ok whatever stuff happens.  Brought them in a second time for another week a few months later. One of them was limping again and eye was kinda wonky and shut as if had been kicked.  I am never bringing my dogs back here again. I Do not trust these people at all."
"2","I was fooled by the reviews. This was my first time ever going to a laundromat, and from the reviews, this placed seems like they would help me figure it out. \nWell,  I took my comforter in to wash today and the lady working was overly rude when I asked her questions. And if I didn't catch it the first time, she started speaking to me in a slow, degrading manner. She also told me I needed the biggest, $6 washer, which was probably actually a little excessive, but oh well. \nAlso, well over half of the machines are out of order. And the place isn't very clean for a laundry facility. \nMaybe I just didn't come when the right employees were working, but these other reviews had my expectations a lot higher than they should have been."
"4","This is one of the better Barnes and Noble locations in town, not to mention the closest to this reviewer's house. And unlike that one on Rainbow, this one DOES have a video section.\n\nBarnes and Noble carries all things books. Be it reference, works of fiction, periodicals, there is a little bit of everything here. Any subject you could possibly want a book on, there is a good bet you'll find something in here. \n\nThe video section is top-notch selection-wise, but their prices are considerably higher than big box stores. They make up for this with a good selection of obscure titles, but you might just want to go to Zia for that stuff. Still, every now and then they DO have good sales in this department.\n\nAdditionally, there is a small section featuring board games and the like, basically things that can make good gifts. A Starbucks Coffee location is featured here as well, complete with outdoor patio area.\n\nTo be honest, I haven't had to ask the employees for much in here. But when I do have a question, they are generally attentive and help me quickly. I haven't had a problem with any member of their staff, ever. \n\nThe major complaint I have with the store is that they move stuff around every few months. The way I see it, if the store layout ain't broken, don't fix it! This makes it a huge hassle to find what you're looking for if they have just done a renovation. Additionally, their frequent buyer program must be paid for, whereas the one at Borders is free. \n\nAll in all this is a top-notch bookstore, I just wish they had better prices on their (not on sale) movies and that they wouldn't move stuff around so often. The store gets a firm recommendation though."
"2","I love books. I love bookstores. I do not own a kindle or a nook. So i tend to buy real books. The kind made from paper. It is rare though that i get a chance to stop by the bookstore. I wasn't missing anything except a future bodily injury just for standing in the wrong spot. \nI could see that this store was changing the layout of some sections. They were adding a toy section. So\nI guess i don't understand the older gentleman wheeling around a dolly and nearly running over my two year old, twice. No pardon me. No excuse me. Sir i know you are older, so i am sure that manners were around when you were a child. I like browsing \ni do\nNot like almost being ran over!!!!!! There is not an angry mob of early Christmas shoppers just waiting for you and your magic, kid smashing dolly to get all of the holiday crap set up in OCTOBER. Rude. I felt like i was in his way.\n Guess some people don't care about the real human shoppers. I did spend over $100 picking up a few books. The girl that rang us up was less than friendly. Asked if i had a membership card. I said no. That was that. No offer to get a membership. Just a buy my crap and leave attitude.  I believe this is the only bookstore in Henderson now. Love the selection. Guess i will stick to Amazon from now on though. At least I am not in anyone's way while I shop online. The people working there should be a bit more nice to\nShoppers. I could care less about your Christmas set up. Hope you guys got done with whatever it was in time though. Seemed like an emergency. One important enough that you shit on the customers. Me. I spend a TON on books. But seriously am just soooooooo\nOver rude ass store employees. Dont they teach you to be nice or maybe to drive the dolly down another path in customer service 101. Guess going around me would have taken up\nToo\nMuch chritmas display set up time. Those star wars bobbleheads are not going to  set themselves up. Gotta please the angry mob."
"1","The worst customer experience we have ever received! My family and I were going to purchase some new books like we have done many times before but the way we were treated by a B&N employee (older women wearing glasses) was anything but family friendly! If you're a miserable person please refrain from dealing with the public. Looks like Amazon will have to be my new book source."
"5","I donate blood here 3-4 times a year. The staff is always attentive and pleasant, and they make sure you are comfortable. They've always been well staffed so I've never had to wait more than a couple of minutes in the waiting area. They are very well stocked with post-donation goodies: a great assortment of juices, water, and cookies. Donating blood is easy and pretty painless, and it saves lives. Plus afterwards you get to take it easy the rest of the day, and make your next meal a hearty one :)"
"4","No complaints about the quality of the haircut, but during my fourth visit, the barber (Bob) cutting my hair started negotiating price about halfway through the haircut.  Their standard price for a haircut is $15, and on my previous visits I've given him a $5 tip.  He said that haircuts \""like mine\"" are extra work (I have thick hair, which requires using thinning shears), and he feels that I should pay $25 (!) for all the \""extra work\"".  In over 40 years, I have *never* had a barber complain about my hair being hard to cut.  If he had said this up front, I would have walked out, but I couldn't really leave in the middle of a haircut.  Needless to say, I will be exploring other options in the future.\n\nUPDATE - I complained to the owner (Ernie), and he was very eager to make things right.  He said to come back next time and ask for him, and the haircut would be on the house.  I did, and was quite pleased with the result.  After a number of repeat visits over a period of a couple years (until I moved away), I would not hesitate to recommend this place - just avoid Bob (the old guy in the far back)."
"3","I have gone here several times only b/c it is close to my house and they have good beer on tap and well my team won everytime I watched my games there.. Superstition has never been my deal but.. this year when the Cowboys were winning in December I didnt want to break forumula & chance the lost. Strangely the 1st wknd I didnt watch the game there we lost. (coincidence, who knows..)\nOne thing I have to mention, some of the waitresses are nice, some are not. Some take shots while on the clock and spend too much time flirting, and not serving.... That's $ that their business is losing out on. \n2nd..the ladies bathroom has the worst sewer stench I've ever smelled. OMG It smells the same way everytime you walk in there. I even tried to manually press the air fresheners and they wouldnt work. I'd really like to see the restaurant improve some to these things. The avacado bacon burger was pretty good -minus the burnt charred sections of the outside of the patty. the Stromboli was delicious. The calzone is tasty and the wings are pretty good, the hot isnt really hot but pretty good texture wise. Not too saucy and not too dry, just right.  Will I go back, certainly. (more for the bar scene than the restaurant. )"
"3","I just stopped by and the premises were sealed by an eviction order dated 15 June---but then next to it was an order to stay the eviction dated 21 June.  The door was still chained."
"1","Most forgetful server ever! It must have been his first night ever.... he forgot the extra plate, the extra side, chips n salsa, and most bothersome....... our drinks!!!!!! We were eating our meals and our drinks had still not arrived. And our food was spicy so we were in dire need of a drink.... then at the end he brings the bill and forgets to add the coupon we already gave him."
"1","Guacamole is made at the table half assed server is rushed and unpleasant. If  I wanted shitty guacamole I could of made it at home for alot cheaper very disappointed I will never go back and it was super expensive for shitty guacamole"
"3","I am not a good golfer, so it's not entirely my place yet to judge a course's quality.  This is one of the few affordable places for a local to golf without having to drive outside of town, so that makes it attractive.  Even without being on top of my game though, I would tell that the fairways (when I was actually on them) were a little thin and sandy.  The greens (after the 10 shots it took me to get to them) were hard, thin and fast.  I would blame my extremely high score on the course, but I'm quite certain that my horrible skill level had something to do with that.  It was a fine course for it's age, and not entirely unreasonable comparably in Las Vegas.  The golf shop people were friendly, the concessions girl was helpful, and the restaurant was quite good.  I would say something nice about the bev cart, but we only saw it twice in 18 holes.  I think that's not quite often enough."
"5","We were at the Wildhorse for a fundraiser a few weeks back. The course was in phenomenal shape and the team running the Wildhorse was up to par! We had massive requests in which all were fulfilled with a group of 400. A great place to attend a round or organize an event"

"2","I took my wife's 2000 Chrysler LHS to this place for an oil change on Tuesday, September 9th, 2014.  No problems, however they informed me that her water pump had a leak.  It did, and after the leaky part was replaced the next day on Wednesday September 10th, and showed to me, I was satisfied with the work, and paid the $727.00.  However, within 25-30 miles of driving, the coolant began leaking severely, by mid-day, Thursday September 11th.  Alarmed with the timing, since my wife takes impeccable care of her car, and since the coolant had never leaked before, and since the container where the coolant gets poured, was less than one year old and installed by a dealership, I took the car right back to the repair center within 10 minutes of my wife telling me there was now a coolant leak.  I was told by the manager at the Purrfect facility that it is possible to put too much coolant in this car, and that was the problem, and they just needed to remove some.  This was after the leak had started, and this explanation was given to me after four of these guys put the car up on the rack and looked at it with flashlights, with their faces 6 inches from the system.  I watched them do this, and was also walked out there, and the hose where they said the leak was coming from, was pointed out to me.  Anyone who fixes these cars, is supposed to know that this cooling system is pressurized.  The leaky water pump was causing the coolant system to run at less pressure than normal, all summer, and then as soon as the leak was fixed, and optimal pressure was achieved, it immediately caused a crack in the container where you pour the coolant into this car.  The change back to normal pressure was too sudden for the integrity of the coolant bottle.  The Purrfect guys completely missed this crack, incorrectly identified the source of the leak, and gave an explanation, that since, I have re-told to three more garages in three different states, a Chrysler dealership in my hometown, another Purrfect location in Las Vegas, and a Napa repair center, and they all have said the same thing, that the too much coolant explanation is a complete B.S., nonsense explanation.  The Purrfect manager told us the car would be fine, and my wife and I drove it to San Diego on Friday, September 12th, to see her family for her baby shower, because she is 7 weeks from giving birth to our first child.  The first time we stopped for gas in Barstow, and turned off the car, the coolant leaked out all over the ground.  We put a little more in, but barely made it the rest of the way.  During the trip I called the Purrfect place back, and the young man that answers the phone said that everything would be fine, there was still just a little excess coolant in there, and the temperature would not be an issue.  We made it to San Diego running the heater at full blast with the windows down, and at midnight, finally had to pull over on Interstate 5, in Carlsbad, and had to have AAA town the car to my father-in-law's preferred repair center, because the engine temperature gauge was approaching the red zone, and it normally is just below the middle.  By 5pm on Saturday, September 13th, my father-in-law's guys had caught the crack in the coolant bottle, replaced it, gave the correct explanation, and since then, the car has run perfectly, and cruised all the way back to Vegas from San Diego on Sunday, September 14th, with not even so much as a rattle.  My basic 10th grade knowledge if the ideal gas law, is how I smelled a rat after that too much coolant explanation, however, my benefit of the doubt initially, with these guys, caused me to be stranded on the side of an interstate after midnight, with a wife a few weeks into her 3rd trimester of pregnancy, 300 miles from home, and caused me to be at a repair center rather than my wife's first, and possibly only, baby shower.  Thank God I have AAA, and thank God I paid attention in chemistry class, because these guys obviously didn't.  The only two contact numbers listed for this company on the website, also, are not valid.  They are dead ends."
"3","This place beats Taco Bell in the face with a baseball bat. I have a guilty love for Del Taco and I come in whenever I'm in a hurry or on a road trip. The fish tacos are delicious and truly rival some of the ones I've had from real Mexican places. The other favorite menu item is the Big Fat Steak tacos. They're wrapped in a pita and come with a spicy white sauce and finely shredded cheddar."
"5","Extremely courteous and expedient. Fixed my tire for no charge. A+"
"5","These people have had my business for quite awhile now and they will continue to receive all my business.  From greeting you at the door with a bottle of water to the quickness of service, they excel above all others.  I recommend this place to all."
"5","My favorite place to eat in all of LAS VEGAS...! Hands down...\n\nReasons:\nCustomer service is superb.  I have been in Vegas for over two years now, visited this place at least over 2 dozen times but have nothing bad to say about it.  \n\nI love love the Korean Chicken Teriyaki rice bowl..its under four bucks, you get a good amount of rice and chicken.  The sauce is different then your normal Teriyaki sauce at other places. I've asked for extra sauce so many time, pretty much with every order...They give without charging an extra penny. \n\nI've recently tried their normal teri chicken rice bowl, also the same price but the sauce is less salty.  Feel in love all over again.  I don't know how this place stays in business charging as they do, but I think because its family own, quite affordable that the locals always comes back for more, keeping this awesome hole in the wall in business.  \n\nTheir spam masubi is 1.50, spam is decent in size and enough for a good filling snack.  :) \n\nI think what put it over the top for me was last night.  I order my usual, the chicken teri bowl on the phone,  but when i came to pick it up, their person who took my order thought i order the actually plate which was two times the price, I make it known to Matt, and he, without hesitation, gave me my food charging me for the rice bowl and extra side of chicken.  (I also tipped a few bucks for the nice service)  When i opened it, the size of my order was not the bowl but the plate.  I was amazed at the customer service this place continuous to reflect.  I called Matt to say thanks once again.  \n\n\nNo reason to not try this place if you haven't been in before, its worth the time, the drive and the room you have in your belly! :)"
"5","Never disappointed eating here. Friendly service, hot and fantastic tasting food.  I especially like the spicy chicken bowl.  You can have it with a fountain drink for under $6, what a bargain.\nI want to try their breakfast one day."
"1","Ordered the roast pork menehune. Looked like TV dinner.  Not coming back. The Siamin was horrible."
"5","Very friendly staff. Little to no wait time. Helped me quickly get a replacement bank card when mine came up missing. Very easy to work with."
"1","Poor customer service, especially on the phone. I know it's Home Depot, but the least you could do is introduce yourself when you pick up a phone call instead of just saying, \""hullo.\"" And don't respond with \""yeah, of course!\"" when we ask you if it's Home Depot because you didn't tell us where we were calling in the first place."
"2","Just came here looking for an extension for our outdoor misters. They had one left if the item we were looking for but when we opened the box (in the store) to make sure all the parts were there, the box was missing nozzles, connectors, and someone had switched out the tubing. We told the worker that was helping us about it and they took it. When we were leaving the guy put it right back on the shelf! So some poor sucker who doesn't have the sense to open the box is going to end up buying it"
"2","Let's see, I could probably say one associate took genuine interest in my concern, and I am terrible for not knowing his name, so to the slender man with the long hair! Thank you for that. I ordered something online that came to my apartment in my name and because it was a gift I was a little surprised, nonetheless, I opened it, the box was beautiful, but where was the gift message? Oh I don't know, perhaps typed on top of the receipt. Really unattractive, I went to the store just to inquire on how deliveries were, and was told that a separate card should have arrived. Ok, that's fine but I just shared that I was disappointed that it came this way because had it been opened by that person it would have been sad. Moving on, I leave to find out if things remembered engraved the tiny thing, no, so I go back to ask if they do, a different associate helps me and I wondered if she even considered that perhaps this had any importance to me... She dropped the pendant and I said \""wow dropping it\"" she grabs it off the table and says to me, \""sorry, angel\"" in a condescending tone...  My gift was an angel pendant. \n#thumbsup\nThe manager shakes her head both times I was there when the associates had to ask her something, did she try to find ways to help? Nope, an upsale could have happened there, thanks for the outstanding customer service zales! I really enjoyed my experience.\n\n#sarcasm"
"4","Honestly, wings are probably my favorite food on the planet. I'll get them any way I can. BWW always has good variety and plays just about every sporting event known to man, which makes this place all the better for me. I'll be spending a lot of time here during football season. My new love is the Thai curry."
"2","I do not know what it is with all of the restaurants on Mall Ring Circle in Henderson, but they all suck!   This is the third time I've been in this BW3, and it keeps getting worse.  My server today (at the bar) was nice enough, but it took 30 minutes to get one order of 8 traditional wings.  And then, they're going to charge me an extra 60 cents for some ranch to dip them in?!  They NEVER have enough staff.  The person I had today was friendly enough, but most of them in there, look like they work in the worst place on earth.  And God forbid you ask for a game on a certain TV (even when it's slow) and they act like it's a chore.  It's a shame, because the location on Warm Springs and Durango is great.  This location could definitely use a refresher course in customer service from them.  I am done with this location.  And I am done with ALL of the restaurants on Mall Ring Circle."
"2","I never write reviews but this made me upset enough to write one. We arrived for a quick dinner but waited over 30 minutes for our order to get to us (which was two small orders of wings). Our waitress was horrible, she was late getting our order to the kitchen so two groups of people that were seated 5 and 10 minutes after us got their food before us. Then one of the wing flavors arrived wrong, I asked the order be cancelled. One of the managers arrived and said that our order would be cancelled (she did NOT offer any discount). I told the manager what happened and she said that food is served in the order it reaches the kitchen. That basically told me that our waitress slacked off. We asked our waitress to call the other manager over , she first stopped and talked to some of her coworkers never getting the manager. We had to get the other manager ourselves (AJ was his name) he was actually understanding and helpful. I like Buffalo Wild Wings but this experience has changed that."
"1","Bugs in my salad and vomit in the bathroom urinal. After showing the manager the chef came out and half ass apologized and said he's seen worse. Clearly they have high standards..."
"2","This place is what it is.. large selection of obviously use items. You'd thibk they would at least give the shelves a dust off every once in a while. Large selection of furniture, that's mainly what I was looking at, but of you want to sell a coffee table for $50 at least try and clean it and touch up the corners that have scratches, cuz I'm sure I could find something brand new on craigslist or online for same price or a little more.\n\nThis is my first time in here but they had a calendar on the front door saying different discounts for the week and Tuesday happened to be today for military,student,employees and a couple other things (but can't remember). The discount I believe each day was 25% off."
"1","I would much rather give this place zero stars. I scheduled a pick up and they sent me a window when they would be there and no one showed up. However I got a call saying he's running. A few Minutes behind I can understand. Here I am not calling customer service talked to 3 diff people aside from the guy Jason who called me the last guy then told me that the driver just went back to the warehouse then left and the best the could schedule me for was 2 weeks from now. Annoying. Never going to them again now that I sat at an empty apartment and wasted 7 hours of my day waiting for them."
"1","Sorry - an employee can definitely ruin it for me! I used to take my girls into the Sweet Factory at Galleria Mall about once a month. They each have a fave candy so I let them get 1/4 pound each and it lasts them for days. \n\nNORMALLY, the employees are VERY sweet and helpful. They smile, converse, offer samples, recommend items, etc.\n\nLast Saturday, my girls begged to go to the mall just to visit the Sweet Factory. I agreed, as it had been a long time since they had eaten candy.\n\nWe walked inside and were IGNORED by the new, young girl at the register. My youngest (age 5) even ran up to her and said, \""Hi! We are going to buy candy today\""! \nShe STARED at my child and ignored her. I became irritated but I let it go. \n\nWe grabbed our candy and went to the register to pay. She seemed irritated that we were in the store. (We did NOTHING wrong, we were quiet and quick).\n\nAs we were at the register, I noticed a more regular employee, an older woman (older than the girl at the register) and the girl suddenly perked up and GREETED the next customers who came in. \n\nIt became GLARINGLY OBVIOUS that the young employee was only being \""nice\"" when her boss was around. The older woman went into the back and we continued to pay. She proceeded to say NOTHING to us, not even \""thank you\"" when she handed over the bag.\n\nThe only time she seemed alert was when the other woman was around.\n\nAs we excited the store, I was MAD. She was rude, pure and simple. I made a comment to my husband her rudeness. \n\nAt the same time, another customer (a man and his young son) approached us. He was behind us in line. He asked, \""Was she as rude to you as she was to us?\""\n\nI wanted to call the store and complain about her but I felt like giving her the benefit of the doubt. But the more I think about how FAKE she was around her boss and RUDE to my children, I'm over it. We are not going back."
"1","Walked out. An hour wait no food and a rude waitress. This used to be a good place. They removed the bar,put a bunch of tables. Now it feels like a cafeteria will not go back! People sat after us, received their food, ate, paid and left and we hadn't received our food."
"2","When I heard my manager said he was going to \""treat himself\"" by going out to Blueberry Hill, I almost fell over in my chair. I mean, has he seen my other review of Blueberry Hill on Flamingo? Abhorrent! Wretched! This is a treat I would give to a used car salesman. Or Satan. Or someone else who's bad.\n\nNay nay, says he, you have to go to the one on Green Valley Parkway. It's 10,000 times better. I responded with a hearty \""meh\"" and went back to work.\n\nToday, however, I needed something to get the creative juices flowing, so I figured why not put Mr. Manager's words to the test. I got to the Blueberry Hill on Green Valley Parkway, and was promptly greeted and sat. In order to be most fair, I ordered exactly the same thing as I did at the last Blueberry Hill: Mexican-style chilaquiles and a Diet Pepsi. It was the same plate of mediocrity as the other one. I don't see how people rave about these places when I always seem to get plates full of mediocre.\n\nOn the upside, the service was a little faster. Not that much more friendly, but at least I wasn't waiting forever to get a refill on soda.\n\nI'm sorry, I'm still not sold on these places. If I need comfort food ASAP, I'm sticking with Denny's."
"5","The only thing that I can say is YUM! I love the pancakes, the waffles and the service."
"4","Clean place, friendly staff. The only negative thing I can say about the place is they typically have 1-2 printers down."
"5","Other quick-mex places charge you for adding fajita veggies, or extra salsa on the side, but Chipotle lets you ask for extra of almost any ingredient for free (*not double meat or guac.)  The portions are huge and the whole \""ethics of food\"" marketing is terrific.  When in doubt, I will happily eat here any time, with any number of friends.  :-)"
"5","Best place to get a reasonably-priced meal with the freshest ingredients. The place is always clean and the staff very friendly and helpful."
"4","I don't crave Mexican food very often at all, but I think Chipotle is a great fast to-go place when you're just wanting a good taco, salad, or burrito.\n\nI was impressed that despite the growing lunch line forming, the employees at the counter assisted the customers very quickly! I was ordering and had my food in hand within minutes. \n\nWe had the steak salad and taco. Can't complain, it was tasty, custom-made with all your choice of fixings, and wrapped up ready to go. \n\nA good choice for lunch, I'd say..."
"1","I am so upset and disappointed with Chipotle across from Sunset Station on Sunset Road. At 1:45pm 6/24/12, a husky latino young man, gave me the WORST service ever! I ordered a bowl with vegetables and steak, of which they apparently were running out. I get a significantly smaller portion than what I usually get at your restaurant. When I asked for more veggies to supplement the lack of both steak and veggies, the attendant said we are out; I said I would wait; he throws the plate away with an attitude and a dirty look, with no intention of giving me what I asked for. I had to spend my money at Spicy Pickle to get the food and service I deserve"
"1","While perusing I saw this Chipotle and thought I'd share my experience.  I ate here once many years ago and was underwhelmed and wondered why anyone LOVED Chipotle.  Fast forward to last year and I had never eaten at Chipotle again thinking \""gross\""...the more is more concept of globbing tons of food into a burrito that was not dispersed properly and had dried out beans and chicken and charged extra for chips and salsa.  Never ate at a Chipotle again.  Then a year or so ago, I had a weekly meeting and always needed dinner and the only place on the road to my meeting was a Chipotle, so I had NO CHOICE but to eat there.  Well, it was delicious!  So delicious in fact that I ate there 4 weeks in a row and couldn't wait to get there.  \n\nSo I finally go back to my Chipotle in my neighborhood and think I have been missing out all these years.  Nope, still dried out, bland beans and chicken.  This location needs some management intervention because I am now addicted to Chipotle, but not this location."
"1","I can honestly say I have never been so dissatisfied with the customer service of a restaurant as I did with Chipotle. Not only was their service an extreme inconvenience, it was just plain rude. While I was there, the works decided to say each other's names in what sounded like a song. This annoying activity dragged on for quite some time. It continued as I tried to order, and the person serving me decided that it would be a good idea to join in on their singing festivities rather than serving me. They cut me off when I was trying to order and then she ended up getting my order entirely wrong. The burrito I received was tasteless and probably one of the worst things I've ever eaten. It is because of this failure to serve me probably that I did not enjoy my experience and I have not returned since. I cannot believe the workers still have their jobs after being so incredibly disrespectful."
"5","Best gyros I have ever had.  \""thumbs up\"""
"3","I wanted to give this place more stars because of the service. Honestly, its pretty impressive how nice they are considering that they are located in a mall food court and have to deal with rude, hurried shoppers all the time. They were very courteous about my groupon and explained the different pitas they offered over the phone while i placed a carryout order. Service wise, these guys were top notch-- very accommodating, very patient, very polite.\n\nI ordered two of their original gyros, a chicken fajita gyro, and an ultimate chicken gyro which came with feta cheese and lettuce. It's definitely not bad. Their gyros are packed with meat. You honestly shouldn't be ordering fries if you are already getting one of their wraps-- it's surprisingly filling. The quality of the meat was so-so. Better than your average fast food style gyro-- the meat seemed to be more thickly sliced. (Don't ever buy a gyro at a place that doesn't explicitly specialize in middle eastern or Greek cuisine) However,  I think you're better off eating the gyros at nearby Greek Bistro. They added sliced tomatoes--pretty standard stuff. The bread was ok, thick but I would have preferred something that wrapped a bit better. But ultimately, the sauce just didn't impress me that much. I was expecting more of an authentic, cucumber based hint to it and it didn't taste much different from standard plain yogurt. Not saying that it WAS yogurt-- I really don't know what it was. But it didn't impress me.\n\nThe specialty gyros we tried were decent. The fajita style gyro is definitely different. They used what tasted like yellow american cheese and grilled bell peppers and onions. A tasty alternative to a chicken burrito you might find at your average fast food mexican place. But just ok. The ultimate greek chicken did have that tasty feta cheese in it but it didn't blow me away. The chicken was plentiful but could have been juicer. I think it would have been preferable if they had used chicken kabob instead of sliced bits of chicken breast. \n\nAt no point during the eating of the aforementioned products did I think this place was bad or regret my purchase. At the same time, there was no point at which I found myself moaning in delight over the flavors. These guys are probably a good bet if you find yourself in the mall food court, but I otherwise wouldn't recommend them as an outing when there are noticeably better greek places nearby in Henderson. Despite my lukewarm review, I WOULD come back here again in the future, but probably only with another groupon, or to try some of their dessert options."
"1","Worst place ever. Not only did they get my order wrong, they didn't put CHICKEN in our chicken sandwich! All it had was cheese and bacon between two buns! Our sodas were filled with ice that the straw would not fit and they were flat. The girl working the drive thru seemed nice, but I would have preferred to have gotten what I ordered."
"1","If I could give this place a negative rating I would. My wife, 4 year old daughter and myself stopped in for lunch expecting a nice lunch. Well, as we all know they play Latin music in their establishments. On this particular day they decided to play whatever they wanted. While eating I noticed that there were F-bombs ad S-bombs being played over the speakers. I asked for the manager to complain and he gave me some excuse that they have no control over the music. BULL SHIT!! I asked for the corporate number and gave them a call. Turns out they have assigned stations that are to be played.\n  I have no complaint about Baja itself, I do have an issue with this location. AND for the little sharpy eye brow wearing Mexican bitch. Who the hell are you to tell my wife that my daughter doesn't look like here? you might want to keep you papers near by just incase a few of my INS buddies decide to stop by for lunch."
"3","I was really hoping to order one of my favorite salads but since we were at a different location, different menu items. Not everything was different, but it forced me to try something new, which wasn't bad. \n\nI ordered a Thai Chicken Salad (I think) which was really good and my boyfriend order a hawaiian pizza with sausage and jalape\u00f1os. We both enjoyed our food very much.\n\nThe strange thing was the service. It was kind of on the bad side. There were probably 4 groups outside (including us) and 2 inside, so it wasn't very busy. And we waited a long time to get our waters, get our food, refills, and our bill at the end, we became impatient and got up and handed our waiter the bill as we were leaving. Eh. They were nice, but slow.\n\nLuckily the food tasted good."
"4","Fat salad is a fat ripoff.   So is 2.50 for a drink"
"2","Nothing spectacular about this burger. I used to love fat burger for the food, not the prices but my meal was not as I remembered. The burger was under seasoned and the egg was wayyyy over cooked. Even the onion rings were nasty. The only thing that made it worth while was the shake, still one of my favorite fast food shakes and probably the only thing I will return to get."
"2","Sport Chalet only gets two stars from me because they do not carry ammunition which I was looking for on Saturday. I must say though, the staff was very friendly. The gentleman I spoke to did not hesitate to refer me to Dicks Sporting Goods. I appreciate the honesty and lack of excuses."
"1","I have to say I really am disappointed in Sport Chalet.  There are few stores who have bad customer service as well as just a messy store.  \n\nWe went in looking for a few camping items.  The store was messy and a little more than a tad disorganized.  It wasn't cheap either.  Really no sales or discounts at all. \n\nMy comment about customer service?  We tried to find someone to help us with a question in the camping section and found no one in the store except up at the front of the store where there were 3 people just standing around talking and joking with each other.  The check out line was 5 deep with one person doing check outs.  The 3 standing there just didn't really seem to care nor want to help anyone. \n\nThis place is a no go for me to go back."
"2","It started out really well. Was seated in less than 10 minutes and our server started out great, but it went downhill from there. \nThe food was great but they forgot our appetizer. Trying to find our server was impossible. Had to keep asking for refills n they forgot to bring out the dessert for my friends bday. When it came to paying the check....once again had to find the server. Keep in mind it wasn't that busy.  Got the busboy to finally take our check. Maybe ill just try another location."
"2","I honestly do not understand the popularity of this place. It's a chain, nothing is cooked up by someones Great Grandma with a secret recipe.\n The Salad and breadsticks are fine. The food seems to be mostly heated up frozen chicken patties etc. Can't I just go to Costco and get the same stuff???\n The pasta is a joke ( seriously how cheap can you get? Pasta is what 99 cents a pound!?) . We ordered Chicken Parm and thought the pasta portion was hysterical for the price. Mainly because a real old school Italian place will give you enough to share with family or just take home. So to us it was pricey for 12.00 or whatever it cost.\n The waiter was fabulous, he was really on top of things. The atmosphere was great, the seats are uncomfortable.\n What Olive Garden has is an A+ in marketing. They stuff you full of a simple salad, and bread so you won't notice dinner is kind of a rip off. The salad bowl is shaped a certain way to make it look huge, all kinds of stuff like that. I have to hand it to them though they are a total genius at making people thrilled over very little. For the Olive Garden fans glad you enjoy it, but it just does nothing for me. Admittedly I was spoiled by old school Italian cooking from my Grandfather."
"2","All I can say to sum it up is long! I got here around 7:45 and it's 10:00 and I'm still here. Not to mention that the waitress/waiter (and yes we had a multiple of servers) did not attend to us. People that got there an hour after me received their food before I."
"2","There are only 2 reasons I come here - okay, one big reason - Shellane! She is the best hair stylist I have ever had. I have never once had to bring a picture of what I want. During our first appointment she asked me a lot of questions about my morning routine, did I use product or not? Do I want to use product? How much time do I have to spend on my hair? etc. She then created this gorgeous look that I was able to recreate perfectly again and again afterwards. Every time I see her, I am soooo happy  with the results - she gets me. She is very hard to book, so if you are lucky enough to get her - make sure you book your next appointment right away and don't miss it (more on that later)!\n\nThat being said, this isn't a review on Shellane, it's a review of Ulta. This particular Ulta's customer service SUCKS! When you call the salon nobody EVER answers. I tried at least 5 times over a couple of weeks to book my appointment and nobody ever answered the phone. So I went in-store to book my appointment with Shellane. I waited for 5 minutes at the counter and nobody came to help me. I figured maybe the receptionist got pulled away for a minute, so I walked around the store for a few other items I needed. I came back, waited another 5 minutes and still nobody showed up. I had to go to the front counter and complain to get someone to help me. \n\nI missed one appointment with Shellane and it took me a month and a half to reschedule (after trying to call several times and going in-store I finally got an appointment). \n\nAlso, there is nobody on the floor to help you shop for products and if you're lucky enough to catch someone as they're speed walking from the front to the back, they have no knowledge of the products!\n\nHonestly, if Shellane wasn't the best hairdresser I've ever had - I would have started shopping elsewhere months ago! \n\nOh and if you're wondering what the second reason was - They (meaning corporate Ulta) have a pretty cool rewards program."
"2","Register service was not pleasant. I'm not sure if the girl who rang me up just didn't like me, but she was nice to everyone else until I got up to her."
"4","Being a fan of the $2.99 crispy chicken deluxe, which comes out to $3.87 when I upsize to medium, I made it a lunch stop. It served its purpose by filling me up at an inexpensive price.\n   On my visit here, the service was fine. The restaurant was also clean."
"5","Stevie at the print/copy shop is awesome! She bend over backwards to help me and got me out of there quickly with exactly what I wanted at a price I fully expected."
"2","Stopped going to the Sunset road location in Las Vegas about a a year ago because food was not good anymore. When the new one opened up on Stephanie St In Henderson, we'd thought we'd give it one more shot. BIG MISTAKE! Steaks were not cooked as ordered, even when cooked a second time. Service wasn't the best either. Only thing good was the bread & salmon. Big disappointment Outback....."
"1","Why can't establishments higher qualified employees?  This is by far the worst experience at an Outback I've ever had!  Went to eat dinner early at 3pm on 9/21 (Sun.)  Our waitress Melanie A. is the worst most miserable server I've ever seen!  She was so rude and unfriendly....I was almost waiting for the hidden cameras to come out and say it was a joke!  We had the steak and all you can eat shrimp.  What a TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!  Save your money and go to a buffet!  The steak was like shoe leather.  We ordered it Medium rare and it was Well Done and about 3 bites!  Both our baked potatoes were only half cooked!  The shrimp with garlic/herb was so disgusting that I can't even express it enough!  It was like salty mushy shrimp you buy in a can!!!!  It was not even edible!!!!  So we changed it to the fried shrimp.....after waiting 20 minutes for our server to be seen!  I still can't get over how rude she was!  Finally after 35 minutes we get 6 small fried shrimp in a dish!  Wow!!!! Don't hurt yourself Outback!!!!!  Usually \""fried shrimp\"" come with cocktail sauce.....but nope!  Our server Melanie A. didn't bother bringing us any!  I am floored that they can hire such incompetent people to run this place and think it will succeed!  I can tell you that we will never be back here again!  I use to go to the Outback in Detroit.....and it was excellent every single time I went!  So I have to assume it's the people running it in Henderson....that will run it in the ground.  The quality and quantity of the food in Henderson is pathetic!  And almost $4 for a soda?  Are you kidding me?  And NO REFILLS?  You can go to any crappy buffet in this town and get way better food and service!  This place is an over priced joke!!!!!!!  Oh and before I forget!!!!!  The bathrooms were filthy and the floors in the restaurant were horrific!!!!  This place needs to shape up bigtime or ship the hell out!!!!!!"
"2","Hair in my salad. No refills. Didn't ask how my food was or how my steak was cooked. Unpleasant waitress. Need I say more?"
"5","If you're looking for a great, casual but fun and friendly place, you've come to the right place. The owner, Rick, is generally there and loves to talk to the patrons. The pizza, hands-down, is one of the best in the entire city - thin crust is excellent! You have gaming machines at the bar, a juke-box, and t.v.'s. There will be KARAOKE on Sunday night's starting on 4/22/2012 at 8:00pm. The bar tenders are trying to bring some extra fun by having movie nights!"
"1","Really poor service, I fixed an appointment for test driving 2 cars. After being made to wait for over 90 minutes, they informed me that one of the cars has been sold and the other one cannot be found. Worst experience ever"
"1","Where do i even began, I would recommend  for no one to purchase any vehicle from ANY CarMax! I purchased a car from them and I believe it came with mechanical issues and of course CarMax in my opinion did not try to fix the issue they just brushed it off. The worst part about it is the car salesman that sold me this vehicle after me calling him multiple times telling him the issue DID NOT DO ANYTHING! And his name was RICKEY JORDAN. They are quick to take your money, but when crap hits the fan no one is there to help. No one should buy a car from this place because you might have to deal with headaches and stress!  I would just recommend getting a car from a big car dealer as in Findley or Fletcher dealerships. I put so much money into this and no one there is qualified to help besides take your money that you worked HARD for and run off without a warning. IN OTHER TERMS THIS PLACE SUCKS! I REGRET EVERY SINGLE DAY EVEN STEPPING INTO THIS BUILDING!"
"1","I actually took in vehicle today because my window wasn't going up. This is not only a mechanical issue but a safety issue as well. Someone could break into my vehicle! I did not make an appointment because it had happened the night before. I get to Carmax and after I explain my situation the woman I spoke to says \""so did you make an appointment?\"" Of course I didn't it just happened. The way she said it made it evident she didn't care about my situation. After asking her if there was anyway they could at least take a look at it she told me if I wanted they could tape up my window. That's ridiculous. When I purchased this vehicle the service was great. But now that I have a simple issue with it I get treated like crap. This definitely makes me reconsider my future business with Carmax when they gave me a hard time about a window."
"4","One of my favorite places to eat when I'm in Vegas! I love the reuben, especially how it's packed with corned beef, light on the cheese, and kraut. The portions are big, and I never skip on ordering the Matzo ball soup. Nice, casual place to eat."
"2","My food was just ok. Not exactly what I ordered. Asked for ham but got bacon. The service was very bad. I had to flag them down to fill up coffee and they acted as they were doing me a favor. But the coffee was good. I may give them another chance."
"3","Decide to whip out a magazine or your MacBook, and voil\u00e0, you WILL stop receiving coffee! They weren't even subtle about it. Eye-rolls and whispering about it among the waitstaff. Wowsers!\n\nThat's exactly what happened to us. And we weren't even there for 25mins at that point. The impressive waitperson-to-table ratio makes this a turn-and-burn establishment that clearly does not want you to linger. Eat and run, or else!\n\nI guess that's OK because Weiss's 1970s decor, cramped booths and low ceilings do not inspire a lengthy meal anyways. You get the feeling that by 9AM the rent has been paid; the rest is gravy.\n\nFeeling 3-star-nice because the food was pretty good. But it's true that bad service keeps you from going back. Too bad - when we're recording at the studio on East Sunset Road, we're there for 3 or 4 days in a row for at least 2 meals each day. Still looking for our go-to spot in that neighborhood!"
"5","Breakfast, brunch, whatever; be ready to enjoy an absolutely delicious meal. The customer service is outstanding and the food even better. This place has a family feel to it. The Hall-ah french toast could not be more heavenly. The tongue sandwich: tender. Their latkas: luscious. Even their coffee will satisfy your cravings. Go there and be ready to be happy."
"5","Excellent in every aspect.  Had the White Fish platter, comes with 2 bagels, cream cheese,choice of salads,6 sliced tomatoes, capers, green and black olives, lettuce, pickle, etc.  Too much.. will be back without a doubt.  $16.95"
"3","We went to Weiss' for brunch on Sunday.  We had not been here in years and it seems like it may have gone downhill a bit.  Per other guests crammed into the waiting area, there was a 35-40 wait, but no one came to put our name on the list until we were standing there for 15 minutes.  He actually started taking the name of the group that just walked in the door instead of us and the others that came in before that group.  Unimpressed with that.  \n\nWhile I was waiting, I noticed that this place needs a major overhaul.  It looks really old and run down.\n\nWe were taken to a table after about 35 minutes and the chairs had standing water on them.  I asked the waitress if I could have a towel to wipe it down, but she was too busy filling the sweetener containers and was rude.  She never brought a towel so I had to ask a bus boy who brought some napkins.  Of course, she ended up being our waitness...figures.  \n\nI was torn between breakfast and lunch.  But I went with lunch and ordered the French Dip.  The meat was fantastic and would have been good on its own, but dipped in the au jus it was heavenly.   The pocket bun looked good, but it was so massive I just eat the meat with a fork.  The awesome food is the only thing that saved me from giving Weiss' one star because the experience was utterly lacking."
"5","Overall, it's the best deli in Vegas. Huge portions, fresh ingredients, courteous and efficient staff, and reasonable prices. Open faced Reuben is a fantastic meal sure to promise a full second meal's worth of leftovers, although it's not a perfect \""Reuben\"" sandwich per say. I've never been a huge fan of eating chicken salad sandwich's from restaurants, but their's is outright amazing and is in my usual rotation. Matzah ball chicken noodle soup is always the highlight of the meal for me, and I always get an order to go whenever I start to feel sick; it's the closest thing to \""mom's\"" you'll ever get. For breakfast, it's always hard for me to try anything other than the \""Ceily's Stack\"", it's savory breakfast heaven with massive latkes and meat covered in cheese and gravy.\n\nHas a nice family diner atmosphere, and service is definitely focused on efficiently turning customers over quickly; which feels nice when your from the Midwest or East Coast like I am. Get in, be smiled at, eat, get a refill, finish eating, and then leave. The way it should be; no lollygagging around with laptops out or any of that nonsense."
"1","Never will I return here.   Eh food and rude management!! Willing to lose a customer over $2 well he succeeded!!! Internet here sucks so I checked in on four square 2 min after I paid when I sat down.    I went up to the manager with my receipt and showed him the four square check in special which is $2 off a $5 order , we spent almost double that.  He refused to honor it because the transaction was done.  It was done 2 min ago!!! I won't be back and I told him that.  It's not that he couldn't do anything it's that he didn't want to.  Horrible management and customer service here.   My first and last time here.   They lost me as a customer."
"1","Imagine going to McDonalds for a Big Mac and finding out they've decided to only serve that particular sandwich (their most popular) once or twice a week.  That's what purchasing bread at Great Harvest Bread Company is like.  Well, no...that's what Great Harvest would be like if the girl behind the counter was flipping you off with a smile on her face at the same time.\n\nIn my opinion, their best item (besides their oatmeal chocolate chip cookies) is their loaf of Cheddar Garlic bread.  It's quite possibly the only reason why I still stop by this place anytime I'm in the area.  However, it's been a few years and I figured they may have replaced that item in that time.  So, I called one of their locations and was told that they still serve that particular bread on Wednesdays and Saturdays.\n\nThis past Saturday, my father was looking for breadbowls for a soup his wife had prepared and I suggested Great Harvest.  We walked in and each got our complimentary piece of bread by the rudest girl that I have ever been helped by.  I looked at their racks and noticed a lack of Cheddar Garlic bread.  At this point, my sister asked the same girl if they had any in the store to purchase.  She responded with a scoff...\""I only make that bread on Thursdays.\""  Trust me when I say that you informing me that this item is unavailable will hardly lead to a meltdown on my part.  What I can't handle, however, is your show of annoyance at my inquiries and complete lack of customer service.  I not only won't be back, but I'll make sure to provide any friends, business contacts or general aquaintances with an alternative business that is only too happy to treat their customers as if they're actually wanted."
"5","Love this place!!\nWhen you go in wether  it is to look or order they give you a slice of homemade bread with butter as your there!! I have had sandwiches, rolls and bread from here and they all are fantastic..\nThe service is always great and this time we were welcomed by the store owner in which he told us how they make the breads. They do the whole wheat there where in back they have an area where they grind the wheat etc by hand!!\nAwesome place and will always go back"
"3","I've only frequented the one in Henderson on Sunset and the one on South Rainbow, both have been great for breakfast, the steak and eggs especially.  The happy hour at the South Rainbow location, with $2 drafts and 1/2 price appetizers. fantastic.  For that, these two places get an \""A\"".\n\nBut as someone noted, their reward card is now pretty much of a joke.  They changed the earning levels so dramatically, it would take me years to get a $10 credit...so on that, and for doing so without any advance notice or taking into consideration past credits earned, they get an \""F\"".\n\nSo they have 3 stars, the average between an \""A\"" and a \""F\""."
"1","Hadn't been here for a while and decided to get some food to go.  Fish and chips was good.  Wings tasted like they had been cooked in old oil and the French Dip was horrible - the meat was as tough as shoe leather!  Will NOT eat here again!!"
"5","Took my daughter and her friend to get their nails and feet done.  The two of them had so much fun picking out what they wanted to do.  They chose ladybugs in a pink flower for the fingernails and ice cream cones for the toes.  She even put on SpongeBob on the TV for them too.  They had so much fun."
"1","Horrible job on my nails!! Never go there! I had a smudge and the fixed it by putting three extra coats on and then the polish still smudged!"
"3","From time to time I get into a hobby that will keep my interest for a little while. Most recently, it is jewelry making. Gentleman's accessory tend to be bland and cookie cutter, so the best remedy is to make your own. The act of sitting down and working on something is also good for the mind. It provides time to just sit back and concentrate on your hand/eye dexterity. Mine are as efficient as a toddler's, but that does not deter me from trying. Look in the local newspapers or mail for Michael's 40%-50% off coupons. Twine, wire, beads, clasps, and other jewelry equipment are inexpensive. It just takes some time to weed through everything."
"1","I ordered for delivery, they did not include cheese on my sandwich, the pizza was stone cold, but the worst part was how rude the worker was when I called.  I will never do business with them again even if they gave me everything for free, HORRIBLE"
"3","So I want to give this place 7 stars because they have zeppoles (and amazing zeppoles at that!), which I've found are hard to come by outside of NY.  But unfortunately I can't rate an entire restaurant on those, can I?  My husband ordered a meatball hero and fries, which he said were both awesome.  The garlic balls are delightful and, did I mention the zeppoles?  LOL.  And the prices are totally reasonable!  Now the not-so-good stuff: pizza was too salty and service was questionable at best.  We waited a long time for food to come, and when it did start coming, we waited longer in between each item!  Also, it came out in kind of a weird order.  Zeppoles before meatball hero before garlic balls before pizza?  I was so confused.  Our fault for not specifying \""appetizer, meal, dessert,\"" I suppose.  I noticed a family who came long after us had food before us!  Anyway, the prices and the zeppoles will keep me coming back and for those reasons you should give it a try too!"
"1","I would not go to or order a pizza from this place. Raw pizza when asked for well done. Employees have a bad attitude the worst pizza restaurant in Southern Nevada. I will never go back to this place."
"5","One of the best pizza places in town great food! good value! Im from the East Coast it's really hard to find a good pizza place tastes as good as theirs!"
"5","I can only say good things about Napoli Pizza! Lord where do I start?! Well first off the prices are amazing! Even getting a medium pizza for a family of three feeds us for more than four days. The mushroom and pepperoni is mouth watering good! We usually order our pizza for pick-up or delivery, but going into the place is nice as well. The place is very quaint, and very nice. They have a couple of big screen TVs as well as a nice dinning room. Their staff is also friendly, friendly and extremely patient. Napoli will always be are go to for pizza, and I dare another pizza joint to even TRY and be better than Napolis!"
"5","I've been taking my dog to GVAH since he was 8 weeks old, for about 2.5 years now. I've been completely happy the whole time! Both vets are so nice and totally understand the \""pets as kids\"" thing. They are very calm and are open to questions any time. Walk-ins are welcome and there is rarely  a wait more than 5-10 minutes, even on the weekends. All of their shots are $10 and the rest of their prices are very reasonable. I love these vets and won't take my dog anywhere else!"
"4","Allow me to start this review by introducing my partner in crime to the Yelp community; everyone meet Ashley D!  Ashley D was my date for this brunch meal at Mimi's about a week ago.  She enjoyed her previous experiences with Mimi's and recommended we try it out.\n\nMy initial impression of Mimi's for Sunday brunch was pleasant.  The decor and setting was fast paced and friendly.  The Cafe offered fresh coffee while you waited to be seated as they were slammed when we arrived.  We  were seated shortly and our waitress was easy going.  \n\nBoth of us being benedict fans couldn't resist the plethora of menu choices in that category as you can tell by the photo I submitted.  The food was all enjoyable and we had a great time.  I'm definitely returning for my Sunday brunch with my partner in crime real soon."
"2","make sure you check the price on the shelf AND when they ring you up. very misleading and disappointing."
"1","It sounds like the food here is spectacular and I wish I'd have been able to try it. Unfortunately, I'm not cool with being pointedly ignored when I walk in somewhere and say hello to the person behind the counter. \n\nLong story short I walked in, was ignored. Went to counter, was ignored. Got order taken, tried to use a coupon, the lady said \""No.\"" \""I can't use it?\"" \""No.\"" \n\nOh. Alright.\n\nI was ordering the daily special and wanted to use an Entertainment coupon. I'd have understood if she had been really nice and just let me know that she would be losing money on a coupon. Then I'd have pocketed the coupon and went about with the order. I just don't like being treated like a stupid jerk. I get ignored and given attitude like this when I wear a name badge, I don't need it when I enter an establishment to spend money. So I told her I'd just go somewhere else and she shrugged.\n\nNo big loss for either of us, I suppose!"
"1","I'm always at Smith's Grocery store in the same plaza and am always curious about this place, so when my parents were in town visiting, I suggested we check it out because it just looks HUGE from the parking lot and plaza.  Umm not the case. It's a really small casino, and you're lucky to get a machine. We went on a Wednesday night and found it difficult to find one. Stayed maybe 15 minutes and decided to head to Sunset Station. Won't be back."
"1","Me and my wife stopped by the place because of a 20 dollar groupon that we bought because we were checking out that sweet theatre next door. So we went to there cafe. After being seated we were ignored for a good hour. Even trying to flag anyone down was impossible. The waiter just walked by us as if we weren't there. Finally a bus boy took our order. Salad bar was good. Then they messed up on my check and charged me full price on my card. Completely ignoring my groupon. I will never come here again. No wonder there so dead inside."
"4","We really like this place.  The bartender introduced herself, and shook our hands!  We started talking about the beers they had.  So we decided to go with there special beer....I can't remember the name of it.  But they don't have it all the time. The brew master was present, he introduced himself to us as well, and the hubby and him started talking beer.  We tried a sample or 2 of the others, but didn't care for them.   As long as they still have the one we were drinking we will be back.\nThe menu looked pretty good, our hearts were set on something else for dinner.  But this was a nice change of pace.\nBefore we left, the bartender started telling us about there happy hour....SAY WHAT!  $2.00 beer....I'm not talking about Budweiser!  Premium beer 20 oz!  Yes, you will see a check in tomorrow!  lol"
"1","Worst. Barbecue. Ever.  We have been told by employees how great this Saturday night \""all you can eat\"" barbecue is for at least a year or so.  So we decided to finally try it and made a huge mistake.  We got there early, and waited while they brought the food to the steamtables - it must have been cold, since they were just carrying the metal pans and setting them in to warm up.  Then, when we finally got to eat - well, everything (except the chicken, which was swimming in sauce) was dry.  Dry ribs, dry brisket.  The brisket was also fatty and tasteless.  No real flavor to any of the meat.  Pulled pork was flavorless.  I guess they cook the meat, and then since they have a pan of barbecue sauce at the end, you're supposed to add all the sauce yourself.  How is that barbecue? It was way overpriced for the quality of the meal.  The only good thing was the coleslaw and cobbler, and that's not worth $13 a person."
"2","I went here on recommendation of friend of friend. I missed lunch and crave Mex carbs. Traveling to LV I know this town is a virtual wasteland when it comes to good Mexican food.\n\nAs I walked in I had the feeling of deja vu knowing I had been here many years ago but no recollection of the food. There's a reason I blocked it out. \n\nDecided to sit at bar. Bartender was attentive and best part of the experience. Great chitchat and good Margarita. \n\nI had the (recommended) enchilada and chili Verdi burrito. The burrito was ok. The pork was pretty tender but there was potato chunks as filler. The beef enchilada was cold. She took it away and said they would put it in the microwave... Says it all there.\n\nWon some money in the bar slot machine and no charge for the drink. So the meal was cheap. No repeat"
"5","One of my most cherished spots for the last 15 years and home of the Best Margaritas in Las Vegas.  When you walk in prepare to be hit with an authentic Sante Fe New Mexico feel and a southwestern food with a slight twist. Free chips, salsa, and re-fried beans wet your appetite for an experience that is sure to lift the spirits. I normally stick with the carne asada or flautas but I've never had a bad meal in 15 years at this place."
"1","I haven't been here in a really long time. This place has been in Green Valley longer than any other place I think. It was just terrible.The walls are a dingy yellow, with plaster repair spots all over. The plastic holder on our table was so dirty it stuck to my fingers, and you could hardly read through it. I ordered the crab enchilladas. They used mealy ground up canned crab meat that tasted like crap. Stale old rice and beans. None of the food at our table looked good, my friends said it was OK. There are many mexican places in town, I won't be coming back here. The best part of the meal was the margarita, large is $13, no thanks."
"5","Ah, yes, Bangkok Orchid...My family has been coming here for the best local Thai food since 1994? My father found this place and we loved it ever since!  We sometimes go there when my mom doesn't feel like cooking...sorry Mom!  We seem to order the same thing everytime.  Mom orders the Glass Noodles with Chicken, Dad-Spicy Beef Salad ( and he orders them really spicy!), lil brothers likes the Satay Chicken and Red Curry Chicken, and I like the Pad Thai and Spicy Fillet Fish(I think it's catfish).  At the end of every meal, mom orders the Coconut Ice Cream in a real halve Coconut! Which is heaven!  The service is great , the crew is really nice, and the price is reasonable.  If  you never been to this place, try going there during Lunch time for their specials!"
"1","Went for lunch recently. The appetizers were good, but the main course was terrible. The beef broccoli was extremely bland and thee pad Thai was simply disgusting. There are several other Chinese and Thai places in Henderson that are far better."
"4","I thoroughly enjoyed this place. Really nice people run the place and it's relatively inexpensive. I had the pad see ew, the mint chicken and the tom yum soup. Their soup is probably the best tom yum I have had in town."
"2","Not impressed with this Walmart McDonalds. As the cashier told the two customers that asked for a Frape Caramel, \""This is the only location that doesn't have Frape Caramels (not sure about that ).\"" The tables were also dirty (felt consciousness about taking a picture with the customer there). With an In & Out Burger in the parking lot, I would have to be craving a Big Mac or not want to deal with a walk in hot temperatures to eat anything more than $5 here."
"5","We recently discovered our sectional sofa pieces were on sale and excitedly decided to add another ottoman to our collection.\n\nMacy's makes it so easy to shop over the phone, and they even went out of their way to try to locate the piece locally to save us shipping (darn, it's coming from CA).\n\nThe quality is very nice, especially for the price point (we purchased the Vice Versa leather sectional after much research and trepidation).  Can't wait for the new piece!  We'll be able to configure the pieces like a large lounge/chaise - or any other way we want."
"2","Shopping in a mall has become a thing of the past for me, but I have a gift card that has been burning a hole in my pocket so we decided to do some good old-fashioned shopping in a department store. The store is pretty outdated and I was little disappointed by the lack of inventory to choose from. \n\nI was pretty sad by how little enjoyment I had in this shopping trip. It felt like more of a chore than anything."
"3","Draft shouldn't be blank."
"1","Terrible wings and service was not great. Waste of money the waitress was nowhere to be found anytime we needed anything.  Also she was too busy rubbing her stomach to pay attention to her customers!  NEVER AGAIN HOOTERS!!!"
"3","We love Hooters!! Wednesday Wings day is awesome and the peanut butter pie is to die for! Girls are cute, but not amazing..  All in all it's a great place though I wish it had the same menu as the Hooters in California. Lemon pepper wings... Just saying!"
"3","I was in the area after getting my car serviced and I needed to pick up a couple of things for my wife.  Siri led me here.  Almost all Walmarts are the same unless they're older one.\n\nI found what I needed quickly, went to one of the quick checkout lanes that had NO ONE in line, and I was out the door in no time whatsoever.  Not bad.\n\nThe woman who checked me out was very pleasant.  I'd come back here if I happened to be in the area and needed something but it's the opposite side of the valley from where I live."
"1","Whoever came up with the solution for checkout for Thanksgiving Day should be fired.   The lines were crazy.  I stood for 30 minutes in a line to checkout just to find out that the line lead to NOWHERE.   People were leaving empty handed because they could not figure out how to check out.    There was no way to get from one side of the store to the other because of the way they had the lines winding through the entire store.    People opened the 6pm things way before 6 and since people were still in line at 7:30 they went ahead and took what they wanted from the 8pm release since they would not be to the register until after 8.    I did not get out of there until 9:15pm .  It is my opinion they tried to over organize it and they made shopping crazy.     I did like that they had added security that they hired.   I also thought it was cute that McDonalds had a cart that they were selling things from in the store.  But the stuff was cold if you bought it.  (Great idea in theory but a hotbox would have helped.)    Maybe next year have numbers that people get when they are ready to check out.    Call them by the 100's   all of the 100's please come to the register area.   If they are not ready   too bad they need to get a new number.     That will teach them for getting a number before they are ready.    All the 200's your up.    This would keep people from standing in lines and they can maybe use that time walking around the store buying other things."
"2","So I responded via email per request to the CSR rep below and she was concerned and courteous.  I emailed her maybe twice and another corporate rep also emailed with concern and humor.  I was then told that the local district manager would be contacting me within the week.  That was a few weeks ago.  I am really over a bad customer experience a month ago, but it is a shame the disconnect between local and corporate.  I need no further contact from dsw, but did feel the need to update the review."
"3","Went to Men's Wearhouse today to rent a tux with my friends for my good friends upcoming wedding.  The store was good sized and all the dress items were evenly spaced and very easy to peruse.  \n\nThe service was great, I would definitely recommend looking online and taking a printout of what rental your like so they can match it up and give feedback.  The tailors were thorough and concise.  I must say this place is great when it comes to the value and service."
"1","My husband has a certain brand of pants he needs for work.  Before moving here we've always shopped at Men's Wearhouse.  Unfortunately this location has failed us.  \n\nWe have stopped in here a few times. Each time the items we needed were out of stock.  Each time the customer service was well below par.   I would always try to make eye contact so they would acknowledge us but no luck.  \n\nThe bottom line is to save yourself the aggravation.  Just order online if you know specifically what you need.  Plus we found sale prices online that weren't advertised in the store."
"4","only been there once and have no complaints.\nim not a huge fan of sushi, but actually tried a variety of things at this one and LIKED them. \n\nthe service was SUPER good. The lady that served us talked like she knew us for years. we were also there till closing and the rest of the staff started conversations and joked around as well. very easy going there. which is a big plus.\n\nits a little tiny cute place tucked in the corner.\ntheir prices arent bad at all.\n\nstacie roll, YUM."
"2","We normally enjoy Red Robin and one of our favorite things is the fries. We had never been to this location but stopped for a quick lunch. The fries were terrible. They were mushy and we didn't even finish the side order that came with our burgers. We won't be visiting this location again."
"3","I've been to local Red Robin's in the Bay Area and considering that it's a franchise, they make everything the same at all restaurants. Needless to say, this place isn't all that great. I can come here to eat every now and then, but it's not off the wall where I tend to want to come back more than often.\n\nWe ordered an onion ring tower which was HUGE! and ok tasting. I'm not much of a onion ring lover and that might have an impact on why I didn't think it tasted great. Me and the wifey also shared a chicken pasta which wasn't all that tasty in my opinion, probably won't ever order it again. But what I do like about this place is their fish, fries and shrimp sampler appetizer, although we didn't order it at the time we came to this place, I did have it a few times when coming to another Red Robin and I do recommend it to others when coming here.\n\nAll in all this place doesn't deserve more than 3 stars as food wasn't that great here when we ate. Sorry Red Robin I just know you can do better."
"3","I happened to be in the mall of all places while on vacation in Vegas.\n\nDecided to pop in and relax while I had a little lunch - seeing how shopping can really drain your energy as well as your wallet.  I know what you're thinking - Red Robin? There's a TON of great places to eat in Vegas - why the hell would you end up there?  Well- I was craving a great burger, and I needed one FAST.\n\nThis RR is probably just like all the other RRs you've ever walked into in your entire life.  I was seated in a small table near the window, looking into the busy Galleria mall.  After checking out the menu, I decided on a \""Keep it Simple\"" plain burger.   The server apologized for the longish wait and took my order.  It took what I thought was a long time for my food to finally arrive - but I was pleased with both the quality and how large my burger was.  I wasn't in a big hurry, so the wait didn't really bother me.\n\nIf you're in the mood for a gourmet burger, check out RR in the Galleria mall.  I'd like to explore the menu and try different burgers the next time I'm there.\n\n3 outta 5 stars from me - worth checking out if you're in the area."
"4","Well for gourmet burgers it was ok. The server Dominic was pretty awesome. The establishment is clean, friendly, and family oriented. I know this review is coming a few months late but I honestly have nothing memorable about the food except for the bottomless fries and I do remember the burger I ordered was a bit dry and thinking if I come back here I'm never ordering THAT again. Wish I could remember what it was called...That was a plus. I will come by again if I'm in the area...have to give the place a second try. :)"
"2","Waitress and waiters are really nice but other than that this place is not the best service.\n\nOur table had no drink menus. Our cheese sticks were not hot, warm but the cheese wasn't even melted. No utensils or napkins and took forever to get one. Main dish wasn't hot. \n\nMy main thing was hot food! Probably coordination between when to take the food to the guests needs help!!"
"3","We never, ever have good service here.  About a year ago, we waited at the hostess stand for so long that we decided to leave.  When we got to our car and put it in reverse, all of a sudden, a waitress comes knocking on my window!  It scared the living daylights out of me and made me almost feel sorry for her.  I guess times really ARE hard when a waitress comes outside and figuratively begs for her lost tip.\n\nAnyway, I was dismayed when that same waitress ended up at our table last night.  It was obvious why we waited so long to be seated during the previous visit.... she was slooooooow and seemed completely oblivious to my agitation.  There were only two tables in the whole restaurant, so a glass of water shouldn't take 15 minutes to deliver.  Ugh.  \n\nThe three stars are for the STEAK TIPS.  Oh my, they are good.  Whether you get them as a breakfast platter or a dinner platter is irrelevant.  The sides don't matter at all either way.  I haven't actually had more tender, flavorful, and consistently good steak tips anywhere else.  I don't say that lightly either - I'm a carnivorous sort of lady.\n\nSo come here if you've got all night to waste, because it's probably gonna take that long to get your order.  But if you order the steak tips, it'll be worth the wait!"
"2","Our server was pretty cranky. We have a large group (8 adults and 5 kids under 4 years of age), which I know can be stressful. But the service was terrible and the food mediocre. There weren't enough table settings (and they never got us any more, so none of the kids had silverware). The only upside is thy the food came out of the kitchen fairly quickly."
"1","What a terrible experience at this one! I have never seen a worse ran store of any type. If you are a regular you get to skip non regular's in line because they walk in the door get their order's made skip you in line and you don't even get asked what you want until that regular has their food and has paid! We were in line before three of these regulars walked in and they had everything and paid before we were spoken to. I called the area manager Rosita and didn't even get a call back, too bad that this area of Einstein's has failed miserably! I was a huge fan of Einstein's in other cities but will never visit another one again. I know these are very strong words, but they are very well deserved!"
"2","I use to actually work here a few years ago when the economy first tanked and I had to do something outside the scope of network engineering/administration. I saw first hand what it was like at this auto center, and besides the fact that the meager commissions I made were often times stolen by one of the other associates, the customer service here is just typical of a large corporation attempting to service the public. Let us continue.\n\nI too purchased tires here because of the warranties. However because of the tire size on my car I had to go with some BF Goodrich traction T/A's. They're not the best tire out there by any means, but they should be good enough to not have to worry about cracking and other things. Well, my rear tires are now cracking all over the place, and regardless of what anyone tells you, tires should NOT crack after a year or less of owning them. That doesn't typically happen until they've been on your vehicle a few years. And yes the incredibly hot climate in Vegas might speed this up a tad, but these tires were cracking far too prematurely. \n\nSo I went in to see if they can swap them out and give me some type of manufacturer defect (premature cracking) on the tire and just swap them out with new tires of the same brand. Well as it turns out these particular tires were discontinued but they did have some Goodyear tires in the same size, but they were of course more expensive. After all the tread depth discounts were put into the system the total still came out to $211 for new tires. That's unacceptable. First off, its not my fault these tires are discontinued, that's BF Goodrich's fault for making garbage tires. Secondly, in the case of customer service, I should've just been refunded close to the full price of what I paid originally. This did not happen and yet Sears again fails on customer service. This is probably why so many of their stores have closed nationwide. Their craftsman warranties are great (lifetime) but dealing with many of the associates there can be an uphill battle. (I worked for Sears Auto Center in California for 4 years while I was going to school and management just makes one bad decision after another which ultimately effects you, the customer)\n\nIf you are intending on visiting this particular service center, only speak to one man by the name of Rick. There's one other gentleman I've had good luck with there but I'm unsure if he even works there anymore. The rest of the sales associates seem like they're just passing time there before they die. They have a very lackadaisical and cavalier attitude toward work in general (remember I've worked with these people, I know them more intimately than an average customer) and they just really couldn't care less about your customer experience. \n\nAs an aside, my mom brought her car here to have her alternator tested because it literally died on the freeway while she was driving. After they tested it they said the alternator and battery was fine. This was not the case. Sears likes to tell people that they can test for these things but they have a cheap, piece of junk miniature sabre voltage testing machine for this that doesn't even give accurate details about your vehicle. Long story short, she took it to MY mechanic at T&M Automotive and of course it was a simple alternator swap. She had it replaced and its been months without a single issue for her.\n\nSo perhaps Sears should seriously evaluate the people whom they have interacting with the public, both behind the counter and in the shop a little better. I know they're bordering on Chapter 11 bankruptcy, but surely you can do better than this. Furthermore, instead of having their vehicle technicians sit behind a computer and take multiple choice tests on vehicle diagnosis to get the job, (yes, aside from brakes and such, the guys back there are just techs that take a test on a computer to work there, none are ASE certified) maybe an in person interview with someone actually asking questions about car symptoms and what the likely remedy is would be more constructive. Also gauging how they are with customer service may be helpful as well. I've seen so many managers fired from Sears Auto Centers who have actually done the RIGHT thing for customers, its not surprising why these places run as poorly as they do."
"3","Not bad for the prices- we happen to be in the neighborhood and the mister was crazing \""olive garden\"" so we decided to try this instead.  They have a spaghetti and meatballs special for $6.99 that includes a salad and bread so I decided to get that.  The mister got the chicken piccatta and we ordered dipping sauces ( marinara/alfredo) for the bread.  I also ordered the minestrone soup and Caesar salad.\n\nThe caesar salad was good- they were a little heavy handed with the dressing but at least it did not taste like the caesar in a bottle- tasted almost homemade with a slight anchovy flavor.\nMinestrone soup was also okay- had plenty of vegetables, beans and was not too salty.\nMy spaghetti and meatballs was, well, spaghetti and meatballs- something I could've made at home.  The meatballs were nice and moist but had an odd flavor to me, tasted like they seasoned it with alcohol or something but it was fine after a few bites.\nThe mister's chicken piccatta was actually pretty good, plenty of mushrooms and capers.  Just the right amount of lemon too.\n\nOverall, I would say it was a success. Not sure if I would make a special trip back but if we happen to be in the casino and craving italian, we might venture in again..."
"1","First off I have to give this place 1 star but if I could give it NO stars I would! \n\nA group of us are in town for a bowling tournament at Sunset Station and decided to have dinner at this place because its inside the casino and convenient, and the decor looked like it would be a nice place for a nice dinner with friends. About the only this this restaurant has going for itself is the appearance. The furniture is nice and modern and the restaurant itself looks remodeled. But don't let that fool you, what comes out of the kitchen is terrible, but more about what they call \""food\"" later...\n\nWe had a reservation for 12 people at 8pm. We arrived early and requested to be seated, it was about 10 mins before 8pm. It wasn't like they didn't have the tables ready because we did make a reservation and no one was sitting at the tables we were going to, but nonetheless we sat down about 10 after 8pm. Because of the size of our group we had to split into 2 tables. We sat for about 10 mins before anyone even came by to greet us or offer any drinks.  The water boy finally came, then the waitress about 10 mins after him. We were starving so we ordered our drinks, appetizers/salads, and entrees at the same time. I wish someone would have told us that it would take over 30 mins to get our salads and another 45 mins to get our food. In fact people who came in after us, ordered their food, got their food, ate their food, and left before we even for our entrees. Bad, bad, bad service only gets worse.\n\nThe food was terrible! Overall it was just bad. Only 1 person out of our entire group was satisfied with the quality of his food, he got the steak. I ordered the veal scaloppini, and when it came it was a disaster! I asked what was in the sauce because it looked creamy and I'm lactose intolerant, the waitress said it was lemon butter. I made my bf taste it, he said it wasn't good and had cream in the sauce, so I sent it back and asked for just some plain pasta with marinara sauce. The veal was pounded super thin, and it was hard to cut through and tasted really bland according to my bf. The waitress didn't even know what was in the food she served, SMH. After waiting for another 20 mins without the food coming I decided to cancel my order all together because everyone else was done with their meals. My bf ordered the chicken marsala, which was so gross that when I took a bite I chewed on it for about 30 seconds before I had to spit it out! It was BAD!!!\n\nWe had to call a manager come over because everything was so bad. But he must know how bad the food and service was because it seemed like he heard it all before. He wasn't apologetic or seemed to care at all. He did say, however that our waitress Jessica is one of the best they have, which didn't mean much because she wasn't great and our service sucked! I asked for a split check, she acknowledged it, then brought one check with everyone's meal on it. Ummmmm... Hello?????\n\nFood service was terrible, food quality was worse. Oh BTW, I should mention that the same jerk manager who did nothing for us ordered his food after us, sat down and ate it at the bar in front of us, and finished before we even for our salads. You would think that at some point he would've looked up and said, \""hey they've been sitting there for a while without any food, I should go see whats going on...\"" but no, he sat there watching tv, eating his food.\n\nI should mention that the restaurant was a little busy when we first sat down, but after an hour of us being there, only 4 tables were seated in addition to ours. So it wasn't like they were busy and that's why the food and service were Bad...\n\nI wouldn't recommend this restaurant to my worst enemy!!! DO NOT EAT AT PASTA CUCINA UNLESS YOU WANT TERRIBLE FOOD AND EVEN WORSE SERVICE!!!"
"1","Horrible service, 30 minutes to get dry steaks and it was not even crowded in the restaurant! What a waste of money to dine here! Trust me people do not waste your time or money at Sonoma unless you want your night ruined"
"3","The place is beatiful, the food was ok, nothing spectacular...  The service was SLOW!!!!!  we all got rather irritated over how long it took to get our food, and we all ordered the same thing, the steak and lobster, we must have waited almost 30 min... \n\nI doubt i will be returning."
"4","3.5 stars\n\nI had seen this place driving by but found out it was an in network benefit when I checked my insurance website.  I'd been sick for 4 days and was in denial that it was anything more than an upper respiratory infection, or a cold.  I finally decided to head in knowing my symptoms weren't ER worthy, but realizing that my primary care wouldn't be able to swab for the flu.  \n\nWhen I walked in I noticed a very strong scent.  Being sick, it was actually a little unbearable.  I wasn't sure if it was a strong cleaning product or a room deodorizer but I was really bothered by it! \n\nWhen I checked in at the front desk I asked the woman if they swabbed for the flu.  She said yes but that I'd probably be there for hours.  I wasn't sure if she was just informing me of the long wait, or discouraging me from waiting, but I proceeded to sign in.  \n\nThe good: I was only there a couple of hours in total, which was better than I though with how badly they were playing up the wait time.  The place was clean.  Plenty of seats in the waiting room.\n\nThe bad: One of the techs or medical assistants didn't introduce themselves when they came in to do a test on me.  When I received my discharge papers no one went over the prescription (side effects, how and when to take, etc.).  I'm not sure if this was because they knew I was in the healthcare field or not, but either way I would never hand my patients a prescription and then say, \""you're free to go.\""  \n\nIt's never fun to have to go to Urgent Care but if you really need to, this isn't a bad place to go.  It's better than waiting 8 hours and clogging up a busy ER with flu-like complaints, and it's probably more beneficial to you than waiting a few days to see your doctor.  I'd go again if needed."
"3","Had the Crunchy Chicken Spinach Salad while waiting for my oil change and it was totally great. Service was fine, though the place was nearly empty.\n\nThe decor involves a lot of red, black-and-white checkers, that nostalgic glitter diner furniture, and a bit of automobile nostalgia. My coffee was slightly stale, but that's any diner for you. I could have asked for a replacement.\n\nThis is also the first place I've seen in Henderson with an actual lunch counter, if that's your thing. I'm sure there's gotta be more lunch counters in Henderson..."
"1","liars, thieves, dont keep their word and are worse in customer service. i will never return again and neither will my friends or family. i love toyota vehicles, but i will have to invest in a honda."
"1","I took my car into the dealership to get the first oil change (new FR-S I bought in February). I also mentioned that the air pressure light would randomly come on but it was no longer on and the tire pressure was fine in all of the tires. The service staff member carefully looked at all of the tires and also stated they look fine, no noticeable issues with pressure, and he did not see any nails. He said they would change the oil and look at the tire pressure light issue.\n\nAbout 45 minutes later he approached me in the waiting area stating that there was a nail in my tire and that they took it out and tried to fix it but then they realized it was a little close to the wall of the tire and they could not repair it so I needed to purchase a new tire. Then he handed me an invoice for almost $300 for one new tire. \n\nI explained to him that I did not authorize anyone to take the nail out of the tire and asked him why they would do that without first consulting me? I did not authorize such work in the service agreement I signed. I have never had a situation where a service shop would do something like that without my consent. I explained to him that Findlay's actions were not authorized and that I am now being forced to purchase a new tire which sounds a little like a scam to me. His response was that if I didn't purchase a new tire they could put the spare on for me and send on my way. I asked if the spare was a true spare or a donut and he said he would go check.\n\nAbout 30 minutes later he came back and guess what.....all of a sudden the story changed. Seems the service guy did NOT take the nail out after all and he is just going to pump the tire up and put it back on the car. Without even getting into how much of a SCAM this is, I told him the tire was not flat, or even low, when I brought it in so I don't understand why the guy had to \""pump it up\"". He had no answer for me.  \n\nI fully believe this was a scam to lead me to believe that I HAD to buy a new tire. Had I not questioned the actions of the service and blindly took them at their word that the nail was removed, they tried to fix it but after it was out they couldn't, I would have been forced to spend $300 on a new tire for THEIR unauthorized work. To further my belief that this I a total scam, only after I refused to blindly pay $300 and questioned their actions did it come out that in fact they had NOT done the work they originally claimed to have done.\n\nI don't know if it was because I was a single female and they thought they had a sucker on the line, or if this is status quo for Findlay but either way it is so wrong.\n\nI got my car and I left.  At that moment they lost me as customer and forever lost my recommendation."
"5","Love Honeybaked Hams... and their Turkey is excellent too!  \nYou can even get sides for a complete and delicious meal!\nOR... you can go for lunch and order a tasty sandwich and side.\n\nSuggestion... call ahead and order the size ham you want.... especially if you are ordering during holiday times."
"1","Worst bank/cu I've ever used. Fees for everything!! They're just crooks trying to rip off hard-working people."
"2","It's been a long time since I've been here.  I will have to edit this once I figure out what I ordered, I can't remember what it is at this time. But I didnt like it!!!!! I should have ordered what my husband got was the pastrami, it was huge!  looked just like the picture!"
"2","I have been to this Jasons Deli several times, it has always been good.  We have ordered delivery from here several times, it has always been very delicious.  I ordered delivery from here today, and it was very forgetable.  The butter croissant that held my turkey sandwich together was really dried out, it was actually breaking as I ate it, it was that dry.  I have said before that they have the best brownies I have ever had....... Just not today. The brownies were overcooked,  one of them actually tasted burned.... they were very dry, not moist and fudgy the way they have been, when I have had them before.  Everything was disappointing about this meal...... it might be awhile before I order from here again."
"1","My credit card information was stolen after I purchased lunch from this location. I called the manager the next day to simply alert her that there may be an issue with their machine. She absolutely denied any possibility of the fraud charges coming as a result of her store, she even went as far as to tell me that \""None of my employees even know anyone in California\"" (CA is where the fraudulent spending came from). Her reaction to my call was that of a remarkably poor manager, particularly considering that I didn't call to complain, just inform.\n\nBe warned-- fraudulent charges appeared on my card after paying for a meal at this Jason's Deli. That, coupled with a ridiculous reaction from the manager are enough to keep me from returning."
"1","worse than the garbage they call their enchilada sauce.\nMy husband and I went there this evening, the man who took our order (finally) spoke one word the whole time we were ordering which was \""combo?\"" To my request for the #3. We got home to discover his beef nachos filled with bell pepper and onions. No big deal, maybe we should've asked. We go back, I explain he doesn't eat this and ask to exchange it. The man has to call the manager (while I'm at the car explaining to my husband that ALL their meat choices apparently come with the peppers and onions) I come back and he gives me his phone so the manager can explain that her employee told us there would be peppers and onions in the meat. I asked if she would just refund my money and she very condescendingly said \""well just this once\"". No apology, no customer service  .\nI would rather drive the extra 10 minutes to the next closest one than go back."
"5","I have been coming to this salon for about 2 years and i have always been extremely happy with their work. My hairstylist, Valerie, is super. She is great to talk to while I'm getting my haircut and is really great at doing my hair. During the shampoo she does scalp massages with mint shampoo that relax even the most stressed person. If I wasn't moving I'd still go there for every haircut."
"5","I called in an order after leaving a near by tanning salon. I arrived earlier than my estimated pick up time by 15 minutes. Instead of making me wait, they got my order together right away. Very fast, friendly service. \nI've never been disappointed with their food. They are consistent with the quality and quantity every single time I eat here."
"5","Among my favorite places to eat. Fair price, great food, outstanding service, \""hot\"" means hot. The staff is always friendly, my glass NEVER hits half empty and I drink ALOT of water. They also almost always give my kids free desert. They are awesome."
"4","This restaurant is one of those strip mall hole-in-the-wall types.  It's tucked away, unseeming, and with little character on the outside.   Frank chose this place on yelp and, to my dismay, we sat in the car justifying our choice for eating here.\n\nWe hesitated a bit while walking toward the door, unsure of what lay ahead, but we sucked it up and entered the front door holding our breath and expected the worst (dirty floors, bad service, poor food).  Thankfully, we were wrong.  This cute restaurant has the old school bamboo chairs and tables with menus ready to go.  There are a few servers ready to take your order and watching each table for refills or other needs.  We were seated promptly, received our drink order within a minute and took a good look at the menu.\n\nTheir lunch menu is simple--choose a meat, choose a sauce and it's 5.95. We wanted the regular menu, though, so we glanced at it and discovered some interesting dishes we never heard of; two, in fact: Bangkok 9 stripped crispy chicken and the beef.  They both had the same finish--a sweet chili sauce with garlic.  I decided to jump in and try something that sounded different to me, and we ordered off the regular menu at 8 dollars a pop.\n\nThe food didn't take long at all, and we were occupied with their lovely steamed (by request) vegetable dumplings that had the thai flavors mixed in.  The sweet soy dip was great, too, and judging by the appetizer we assumed that the lunch itself would be great.  We were right.  First off, the food was beautiful.  The chicken dish was shiny and glazed over with this transluscent, orange chili sauce.  It smelled fantastic.  Although flour coated fried stripped beef doesn't look as appealing, it didn't taste anything like the visual expectation of it.\n\nTheir sauce on these dishes are great; sweet, slightly spicy (you can order no heat) and had a garlic (subtle) finish.  The chicken and beef remain nice and crispy despite the sauce, which is something I always look for in fried dishes like that.  It was like eating crispy light pieces of chicken heaven drenched in sweet love.  The plates were piled high, too, so sure enough we had leftovers for lunch the next day.\n\nThey provide a bowl of rice enough for 3 - 4 helpings between 2 people, and because the sauce is slightly tangy and sweet (it's really like a thai version of a sweet & sour, but better) the rice is nice to cut that while eating.  By the time we finished the rice bowl was cleaned out and the leftovers neatly packed with more rice (they did it on their own, which was nice).  We patted our tummies and paid a 20 dollar bill (not including tip) that includes 2 dishes, an appetizer and drinks!  Their lunch menu, although cheaper, was good, but I'm so glad we tried their Bangkok 9 dishes instead.\n\nIf you're looking for cheap eats in a place where two worlds collide on a plate, try this hidden restaurant in Henderson near Hobby Lobby.  It's good, it's filling, and it doesn't put a hole in your wallet.  You know how I know it was good?  I dreamt about it and craved it the next day.  As a matter of fact I'm going to end this now so I can drive down there for dinner.  Ciao!\n\nPS: If any Guam people read this review, remember House of Chin Fee?  The chicken dish I refer to tastes like their sweet & sour chicken.  I grew up on it, so I'm a fan :)"
"1","Lunch specials & staff have always been consistently good, but we ordered dinner for pick-up and it was awful, just AWFUL.  Two noodle dishes were overcooked to a stuck together glob. Just over-spiced with hot sauce and had almost NO veg mixed in.  Spring roll was tasteless & poorly assembled too.  It was so bad we have decided to even stop going at lunch as we will not support a restaurant that would put out as sub par as we they gave us tonight."
"2","Boy how things have changed.  The staff and menu are the same, but the way the food is prepared is completely different (not in a good way) and the service has become very slow.\n\nI'm not sure what happened, by I hope they get their act together."
"3","Lunch with my mom\nNot Thai spicy\nOK\n\nSo, last Saturday, I had lunch with my mom at Bangkok 9 while waiting for the dealer to finish up repairs on her car. We were actually heading to L&L but when I saw Thai, she didn't argue with me when I suggested it. \n\nNice, clean place. Open dining room - friendly staff. It wasn't very busy but it was a little on the warm side and if I lived in the Las Vegas Valley, I'd be out on the lake cooling off.\n\nAnyway, I opted for the Pad See Oew and I asked for Thai spicy. She didn't understand my request and asked me for a spice level from 1-10. I told her a 9 or 10. When my dish arrived, I was excited because it was steaming hot and it looked to be spicy as I could see the pepper flakes on the noodles and even on the vegetables. \n\nBut it wasn't. That was a big disappointment for me because I wanted and I asked for really hot. Either they didn't feel like I could handle it or they just don't make it Thai spicy. Otherwise, the food as far as taste goes - was ok. It wasn't bad and I actually finished off the entire dish. But it wasn't so good that I'll make a trip out to Henderson to order that same dish again. \n\nDecent prices overall. Decent service as well. My mom really appreciated how they packaged up her to go container with the left over Mongolian Beef and white rice she didn't finish. They actually separated the two selections using foil in the same container. Attention to details like that got them the third star for me."
"1","Absolutely disgusting.  Ive been here before and it was good. I just tried it again and got pad thai. The chicken was old and smelled and the shrimp was overcooked and not cleaned. I will never return and wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
"1","We ordered to go, and the food was not great. We will not eat here again.\n We ordered the red curry chicken. It was watered down like soup, and other than the hot chile, there wasn't much flavor in it.  We ordered the chicken satay. My 6 year old said,\"" How am I supposed to eat this, it is so hard?\"" It was so hard and dry she couldn't even bite into it. We ordered the ginger chicken- again watery broth and you couldn't even taste the ginger."
"2","Awful customer service.  They swear they are a high end store.  All I did was ask for a military discount and they swore I was robbing them or taking it out of their paychecks...come on!\nGEEZ..."
"1","I had a horrible experience here! I am from Hawaii and usually get my nails done there but I am often in the Vegas area for work so I thought I would give this place a try. I am sorry that I did! I needed to take off and do a new set since my french nails had grown out. Instead of telling me that they did back fills, she took them off. First of all though, they did my pedicure. Normally, while doing my pedicure, most places that I have patroned will soak my nails to make it easier and faster to remove them later. Not this place! So, she starts to take off my nails using another nail tip. The place where I get my nails done in Hawaii does a really good job of bonding the acrylics to my natural nails so she had a hard time with taking them off. I have a pretty good tolerance for pain but after a while, I couldn't take it! She kept saying over and over again how this was the first time she had had any trouble taking off nails before. I mean constantly saying it to the point where I started to get irritated! I wanted to tell her to just shut her trap because she kept saying it like it was some excuse that she sucked at this! I told her that normally, nail salons would just soak my nails and sand them down until they were gone but she kept on trying to pry them off. I couldn't take it any more! It hurt so bad that I pulled my hand away and yelled in agony! She still didn't get it so I had to raise my voice a little and tell her to stop doing what she was doing since it wasn't working and it was extremely painful. I told her to just soak them and sand them down because this was obviously not working. When she finally got them off, She did the acrylics and she did an ok job. I did have to tell her to fix one that she had made crooked. Finally, I get gel overlay, so after they were dry, she noticed that there were bumps on most of my nails. So she files them down and puts gel on only one nail! I didn't understand why only one when there were others that were scratchy on the surface! I told her that I wanted them all smoothed out by putting another coat of gel but she said they were on the sides and I didn't need it. By then her appointment had sat at her station and I didn't want to make a scene. I will never go back to this place for my nails! The next day, one of my nails started lifting. A few days later, More than half of my nails started lifting. By then I was out of town already! The pedicure wasn't the best I had but it was still good. I felt rushed though. : ("
"1","This place is HORRIBLE. I went in for a set of French gel nails and they looked BAD. The nails weren't painted all the way, the white lines were crooked and uneven. They chipped within the first 15 minutes. I went to another salon because I didn't want to complain and they said it would be $15 just to remove the gel. I went back and waited for the lady who did my nails (no trying to make a scene or get her in trouble) and told her I didn't want my money back and to please just take it off. At first she said no they look fine. Another girl looked at them and I asked to speak with a manager. I was told no manager would be there until tomorrow. The original lady then kept saying I am too picky and that I want to look like a model, but can't so I blame her.. (lol really?) At that point I said either have someone fix them or take them off and refund my money. The other girl finally got the manager on the phone and said they would remove them and refund my money. Then the original person began drilling so quickly that she was hitting the skin and making me bleed. I asked her to slow down and that it hurt and she's rolls her eyes and says or what are you going to call the manager? She doesn't care. She also said you can't be a model and I bet you do this all the time. I said no, I went somewhere else to get it fixed first and told you they were full of bubbles.  I asked the other girl to finished. They refunded my money and I gave the girl who finished $10. I went without my nails done and returned without my nails done. $10 to fix her mistake. NEVER AGAIN!!"
"2","We have gone here a few times. \n\nMy gf being a vegetarian really loves the fresh salads and vegetables they have, It is a good selection and it is always fresh, but dang, its expensive for salads. \n\nService is always prompt. They also walk around with cookies and offer them to the tables, my kids love it of course, who doesn't like a nice warm cookie???\n\nAnd something else I hate is getting banged for drinks. I think they were 2.50 or 3 bucks. For soda fountain drinks???? \n\nIn the back section of the restaurant it always smells like feet too.. Just an observation.. :)                    \n\nThe pastas are just OK. Sometimes the soups are good. A friend of mine told me there is no way you can eat as much food as you paid for. I kind of believe that every time I go there.. \n\nThe funny thing is, with all this mediocrity, the place is always packed! \nI guess people love a so so place.\n\nI dunno, Sunset Station is just down the road, its cheaper and better and drinks are included!!!! \n\nI'm just sayin,,,,"
"4","I love Sweet Tomato. This place is always first choice for my mom. There salad bar is so tasty with different vegetables, fruits and salads. Often there are new combinations available. Recently, they added premium choices to the salad bar. I'm not a fan because I always get edamame when I go, and now it's $2.49 in the premium section and you only get 1 serving, so make it good. I was quite bummed. But, I love Sweet Tomato too much to stop going. The mac and cheese here is so creamy and good! I always eat more than 3 bowls of mac and cheese. The soups taste very fresh. Most of the time I get the chicken noodle and just eat the fresh egg noodles. My mom loves clam chowder and broccoli cheddar. The pizza bread is baked just right- the bread has a nice crunch while being soft. \n\nThe price is not that bad if you get your money's worth. They have senior and military discounts too.\n\nThe service is great too. They are always willing to help. My sister brought her baby one day and they seated us where we wouldn't be in the way of those passing by with the baby chair. The workers came around often and cleared our table, so we could indulge in even more tastiness. At one point they walk around and give everyone complimentary cookies. Although the new premium menu is a bummer, I will not turn down a trip here."
"2","Oh Sweet Tomatoes how I USED to love you... Seems like this location has gone way down hill. Went for dinner with my hubby on a Thursday night at 445pm to try and beat the crowd. So many veggie bins on the salad line were empty or looked less than appetizing since someone would spill other stuff into another bin. Yuck. There were tons of kids running amuck thru the line as well putting their hands on everything. One kid had an entire plate full of just boiled egg crumbles and was running up and down the line with no parents in sight. Where are the parents or management/staff to control this kind of stuff? Putting hands on everything is so unsanitary, which is why I usually stray from buffets... When paying, I was shocked at the prices now. I haven't been to a Sweet Tomatoes in about a year or so, but $28 for 2 dinners and 2 drinks at a salad bar seems way ridiculous. Another $10 or less and I could have gone to Outback and we could had some steak with our salad!\nAfter seating we went to get drinks and I was so disappointed that their tea was empty and they dont have apple juice anymore since I am not a big soda drinker. We then ventured to get some bread and soup to go with our salad. Almost all of the soups had that crusty layer on top from sitting so long. There was no butter for potatoes or bread. The foccacia and pizza bread was just the crusty outter layer that no one ever seems to take. The pastas were crusty and dry looking. So much for my appetite. After eating our salad and little bread/muffins that weren't old looking we went in for some of their gooey chocolate cake. Again only the outside rim of it was left and it was rock hard. The guy behind the counter said it would be a while before a new one was out. He just stared at the kid who was digging around the cake and using his finger to scrape the cake off the self serve spoon. Gross. We then just settled for a dry brownie muffin and ice cream. We never did take anything from the fruit/pudding bar since that was covered in kids as well and all the bins were almost empty. \nKnowing that I am pregnant and hormones are raging, I decided not to complain since it would probably turn out ugly with me either screaming or in tears. Just left hungry and disgusted. I will not be back to this location. Too bad the express location is closed now since I did frequent it all the time. Guess I will head back to the 215/Flamingo location with higher hopes. That one always seemed to hit the mark."
"3","The locations in phoenix have chicken we can add to our meal. This location does not. We drove an extra 10 minutes to get here  to find out they don't have chicken was not a pleasant surprise."
"1","Never again , crab cake salad tasted like vomit , crawfish was way to plain and flavorless . Not worth my money sorry ."
"3","Have been to Joe's a number of times and enjoyed their food.  We have had terrible service every time, though.  It's worth going because the food is good and the atmosphere is fun.  Just be patient, and your night will be fine."
"4","I have been to a Joe's Crab Shack in New Jersey, but the experience we had at the Henderson location was very surprising.\n\nFor one thing, I don't recall ever seeing the staff dancing at a Joe's. I have seen it at Johnny Rockets locations where the staff half-heartedly does performances every so often. There is a clear difference between what I have seen there and the staff at this location; the staff members here actually seem like they are enjoying themselves. If they really aren't, then they are adept at making it seem that they are. Even the \""Happy Birthday\"" routines were different from table to table. For such things that the staff is required to do regularly, I could see how difficult it is for them to be \""convincing.\"" I give them quite a bit of credit for that accomplishment.\n\nFood and service were top notch here. I would consider returning to this location in future trips to Vegas as an \""honorary local.\"""
"4","Great atmosphere.  I like to visit once in a while."
"4","We went to try there Fish fry for $10.99 available Monday, Tuesday & Wednesday.\nI have to say, you get a lot of food for the money.  But the fried calamari was the best.  The plate was full of calamari & frys.  Could not finish it all.  One of has the fish and the other the shrimp.  Also comes with green beens, onions rings, hush puppies & coleslaw.  Signing up for there club also gets you $$ off coupons almost weekly."
"5","Two words: KIDS SUITE!\n\nThe kids have an area all to themselves. It is cute and clean. Staff was kind and helpful. Aaron did a wonderful job before we even arrived by checking us in (as we were worried that we'd arrive too late - and lose the room)! Inexpensive stay but it feels comfortable.  Great hotel!"
"2","Service is good not to be confused with great, the happy hour specials are awesome draft beer for 3 bucks you cant go wrong , clam chowder is dismal , overall it is ok , waitress could have upsold the beers and explained all the specials a little more .."
"1","A friend and I stopped here after a movie. Walked in the front door and the place was nearly empty (3:00pm Mother's Day!)\nWe were told we would have to wait fifteen minutes to be seated! Honestly, the place was half full and plenty of tables were available. \nWe asked if we could sit at a small table in the bar area (which was TOTALLY empty) and were told we would have to wait fifteen minutes to be seated.\nA little puzzled, we asked about getting food while sitting at the bar. Hostess told us that would be fine.\nWe decided to leave. Before we left I asked the Hostess , \""Why the wait? The restaurant is half full?\"" \nHer response was, \""Because my kitchen is backed up\"". I said, \""Wait, we can get food without a wait if we sit at the bar, but the kitchen is backed up and you are half full.\"" This does not make sense?\"" She just got mad so we left. Went to Sammy's Pizza in the same area, great food, great service, even a glass of champagne for Mother's Day. We called the manager of TGIF from the restaurant and asked her about the \""wait\"". She told us there was no wait and no back up in the kitchen.\n\""You need to let the hostess know there is no wait\"". Manager did not really care.\nThis place should be packed on Mother's Day-every other eatery on Sunset was packed.\nThis TGIF's is on its way to closing unless the owner gets a grip on his staff. ..Call in the Restaurant Recovery program! This staff is killing what should be a successful franchise!"
"5","KIDS ZONE! Enough said, they will babysit your children as you gamble. IM SOLD! Hotel is clean and the rooms are amazing!"
"2","This place is super sketchy! \n\nI met my friends here for lunch since it's about the half way point for her and I. We went to cabo, the waitress was excellent, the food was great... just the other customers....ah, something  interesting to see. I wouldn't come here alone at night."
"4","I think for the price of the rooms it is a great place it is very clean and the costumer service is great. Wish the buffet lines weren't so long though!"
"4","Never stayed in the rooms I eat there and the Grand Cafe is fab, the price is okay, the portions suits the price. However the food tastes great. \n  I don't do the buffet often but when I do I have never had any complaints. Nice selection. and if you have a Players Card you can get a good deal. \n  Yes its a casino so its smokey and there is no real non smoking place. The smoke is everywhere, its Vegas Baby.  The machines are pretty good, run when you win is my advice. Lol. \n   As for the service Its not easy to find someone to help, the cutbacks seem to still be in effect. Little tip, those guys in suits with badges, grab one. lol.\n   The Station Casinos love Locals!!!"
"1","I stayed here Labor Day weekend 2013 and had so many problems from  being given a room that was occupied , locked out of my room, no maid service, double charged on two credit cards and told that I had two rooms reserved instead of one. They offered me a free upgrade which I decided to take for the same weekend this year, Just four days before I am to leave I just got a call rescinding the same offer that they offered and set up. \n\nI was offered food and beverage comps that do me no good unless I cancel other reservations. They also offered to pick me up at the airport and that does nothing for me as a friend I am meeting is picking me up. I don't think a hotel could do any worse than last year but they topped it by ruining my vacation two years in a row. \n\nMy past stays had been good but they wiped out years of good stays with these two and I think it is time for me to stay where my business is appreciated. I would never recommend staying here to anyone for fear they might get the same treatment."
"1","Avoid this Kidsquest Boulder Station location and go for other locations at Las Vegas if possible!\n\nI was extremely dissatisfied about the child care service provided to my 19-month old baby from this center. First, during her 5-hour stay, not food nor drink was provided or attempted to be provided to my baby. My baby was crying like crazy when I picked her up. I need to give her formula immediately. She consumed it non-stop and stopped crying after that. I read the check-out form and no meal/snack/fluid was noted. Second, when I checked her in, the staff said a meal will be given to her since she will have a 5-hour stay from evening around dinner time. Obviously, it was just a lie. In addition, I was not reminded at all about the additional charge if I pick the kid up late. I was charged $25 even I was a few minutes late. Finally, the staff over there were totally unfriendly. I was treated like I have been giving them trouble. Their attribute was unacceptable and they were irresponsible for my kid's stay. I called the customer relations department and told them all these. They said they are going to research and talk to the director of this center. I will wait for their callback and may need to escalate this to Nevada Department of Health and Human Services of their inhuman treatment to my baby."
"3","BLUF: You get what you pay for.  Excessive Chip Repair = Excessive Orange Peel\n\nTook my car here to get a paint job.  I had no significant body damage other than minor chips in the paint.  I did have significant oxidation to the hood and the roof.  I was painting the car the same factory stock color.\n\nThe positive: The cars paint job is a vast improvement to what was on the car prior to the paint job.  \n\nThe negative: Massive Orange Peel all over the car!  The excessive chip repair I paid for only covered most chips according to the informative panel on the wall of the shop which they were happy to show me after I showed them the remaining \""excessive\"" chips.  In fact, I'm convinced that the excessive chip repair is done by fixing the big chips, and the smaller chips are fixed by spraying on the paint on thick which causes for excessive orange peel which help to hide the chips.  Since I didn't pay for the \""deluxe package\"", I'm stuck with the orange peel paint job.  They took off the emblems and didn't put them back on.  I asked the manager if they kept them, he said they were in the glove box.  I should have checked it before I left, but I didn't.  I came home, checked and of course they were nowhere to be found.  Contacted the manager multiple times and they have yet to locate them.  They also pained over my plastic air dam at the front of the car, which was black, but now matches the car color.  \n\nI understand that when I go to Maaco I can't expect the greatest quality.   But I feel like they didn't care about me or my car to do a thorough job to where I would feel I got my money's worth.  These guys need to know that it's the attention to detail that really impresses people enough to recommend their business to others.  Unfortunately, I cannot.  The car's badges are going to cost almost $200 to replace if they don't find them.  If they find them or replace them, I'll up my rating to 3 stars.\n\nUpdate:  They found them.  I had to show up so that they would take me seriously.  So I'm upping it to 3 stars."
"1","Horrible service!!! Why even have an appointment if you are not going to be seen for HOURS after?! This is absolutely ridiculous!  Just because I don't have the best insurance,  doesn't mean I deserve to sit around for hours! I WILL be finding another doctor TODAY! Anything is better than this!!!"
"5","Highly recommend anyone to go here!:) the staff is really nice and Dr.Goldman is a very good doctor and he's honest,prices are also reasonable. He saved my dog did surgery on her and I'm so thankful for his work!"
"5","Very polite service when I called Rakeman plumbing yesterday.  Charlie was at my house within the hour without having to pay a diagnostic fee as with two other plumbers I called.  Fantastic service, polite, efficient and knowledgeable.  Will definitely use again.  Thank you Charlie!"
"4","Always excellent service and food at this location."
"3","Super disappointed w/civiche de camarones.  Seriously lacked flavor other than lime.  Nice server, loved the tableside guac & all the chips and salsa.  Entrees took forever.  Exc margarita!  I would eat there again, everyone else liked their food."
"2","Slow service. I thought the food was kind of tasteless. I had to smother it in salsa to taste anything good."
"5","The hubs and I were there for dinner last night and it was amazing! The service was impeccable, the were very attentive to us, even thought there were some large parties seated near us. The servers were not wandering aimlessly throughout the restaurant, they were on a mission to please the customers and make sure that they felt as though they were the only guest in the house! Jose, our waiter was excellent, his other server-bus was literally running throughout the tables cleaning up, serving chips, and checking on tables...Our food came out in a timely manner and was excellent! The homemade flour tortillas are outstanding and the manager inquired as to how our meal was @the end of dinner and was genuine about it! It is close to nellis afb which was perfect! We may have to go back for cinco de mayo!"
"5","First of all, I live in Henderson and come to this place when I am craving authentic Mexican food. In other words, I travel about 30 minutes and pass a lot of restaurants along the way. I have tried a few dishes that have been really good, but I think I have a favorite- the pork marinated in Coca-Cola. The pork is tender (not fatty), and is covered in a sauce that will make you slap your momma. Oh, did I mention there is a lady in the back making homemade tortillas? Please remember to tip this nice lady -- she is working hard back there. The staff is friendly and attentive , and there is a good chance you will catch live music while enjoying the best Mexican food in Las Vegas."
"4","There are a couple of things that make you realize you are at a LEGIT mexican place.\n\nMenu has lots of things that you have no idea what it means\nThere is a random guy that plays a guitar in the corner\nAnd the most important : there is a chubby nice mexican lady making tortillas ..fresh ones \n\nThis restaurant was amazing. Service was impecable. Drinks , salsa and chips NEVER went below half before getting refilled.Impressive!\n\nI am not giving 5 stars because of its location. Why so far?? and why behind a truck stop?? \n\nWhat would i recommend? The coca cola steak, carne asada and the refried beans. Epic win plates!\n\nWe were a group of 12 and the food came outstanding, service was impressive, ambiance was legit and overall experience was great. Check it out !!"
"5","Fantastic atmosphere, great service and the food was delicious. I've finally found a good Mexican restaurant in Vegas!  3 years later..."
"4","I think I was the only person in Vegas who has not part-taken from this hidden local gem.  I've heard all great things from everyone over the years but never had the chance to experience it.  \n\nWe met some friends there on Friday night.  The parking was a nightmare.  They had a huge section chained off where I believe alot of their customers usually park.  We ended up parking at the 7/11 and our friends had to park across the street in a vacant lot.  There was a 20 minute wait and there were people everywhere inside and outside waiting.  We decided to get a drink at the bar.  The bar is big however every seat was taken.  There were some 2 seat high tables on the side so we decided to grab one and just order drinks at the bar.\n\nSo taking a look around I felt like I took one step into Mexico.  Colorful flags draped the ceilings. The d\u00e9cor is fabulous.  I was already sold one minute into the place. There were a couple large parties which occupied a lot of their tables and a lot of their attention...which is probably reason for everyone waiting in the front.\n\nWe were finally seated and immediately served fresh chips, salsa and bean dip.  All of it was fantastic.  The warm bean dip was my favorite.  The BF and I ordered the chicken fajitas to share and the tortillas were fresh and homemade.  It was just enough food for us with all the chips we ate! ;).  \n\nAmbiance - Beautiful authentic Spanish atmosphere!  Service - as quick and attentive as they could be being there was a full house and large parties.  Food - a definite score.  And Parking - a bummer but we lived.  Overall good time had by all!  It wasn't just a meal it was an experience!  Totally whole heartedly recommended!\n\nWe will be back soon."
"5","Ate dinner here tonight. Sorry that we didn't take any pictures of our meals. The food and drinks were delicious. Especially the Queso Condido con Chorizo. Our server Ramon was excellent, and so was Osmani. Will definitely be returning. \nGood service, good food, good drinks = A GOOD TIME !!!"
"1","Went out with some coworkers last friday to chicas bonitas. We had a pretty good time,  with the exception of having to wait 20 mins for a jager bomb. I proceeded to wake up with strep, shoulda skipped the bomb. I may go back, but i will not touch the glassware"
"1","Order 2 large Chilis\n2 spicy Chicken Nuggets\n2 large Drinks (Fruit Punch and Diet Coke)\n\nSimple order you would think...........NOT\n\n2 large chilis were filled only half full\nNo spoons to eat it with\nDoes Diet Coke sound like Regular Root Beer?\n\nI will keep writing reviews on this place until they change their ways. Give someone else a job if you don't want to work there."
"4","Great college! Many people resort here if they can't get into UNLV. \n\nThough it has enough credentials to educate and produce successful and driven people.\n\nOnce pass through the \""beginner\""/\""intro\""/\""101\"" classes to the upper \""pre-med\""/\""transfer\"" classes, is the change in atmosphere with the type of students. Great people who are hoping to achieve and succeed. \n\nMost the student staff are not helpful or informative, don't let them hold you back in going to this college!"
"3","I ordered the 4 pc fried chicken (I think it was $5.29). It came with fries and a couple rolls. The chicken was ok. The fries were too salty. There was a lot of food for $6.\n\nYou probably want to phone in your order before coming here because it's kinda greasy inside. \n\nI'll probably come back and try their philly cheesesteak."
"2","The fried perch came pre-battered out of a box in the freezer.  The fries came out of a box next to it.  I saw the chicken strips on another table that looked like your basic freezer strips also.  The burger reminded me of my high-school cafeteria except with three times as much mustard as was necessary.  The hot wings were your standard deep fried with a sauce that I'm sure was straight from a jar.\n\nThat said, it was all pretty cheap.  However, I don't think it deserved the rave reviews.  I might try the fried chicken if I happened to be in the area but I'm not going out of my way for it."
"4","Good find in the North! \n\nFried Chicken - best tasting fried chicken I've ever had! Nice size portion for 2.\n\nCatfish - very good, just wish they gave a little more.\n\nBurgers - ok. tasted like a regular ol' hamburger to me. Which brings me to my next question, why is it called Hamburger Hut when they're burgers are mediocre as hell? Haha\n\nIt's a convenient store/restaurant. But more of a restaurant. It seems busy all the time and I hear people always ordering the fried chicken.  That's all imma get here too. \n\nParking is limited. Like, only 7 spaces limited."
"1","The only reason I am giving this a one star is because this was my second time there, and this time, they messed up on processing my credit card and charge me $84.01 for my chicken wings. the lady said she voided it, then swiped my card again and fixed the price, 5 days later it was still taken out of my bank account. My bank is going to fix this for me, but I should not have had to go through all this hassle just for these dang wings. Because of this mistake of theirs I will find another wing place. I mean what if I had needed that money for a bill or something. Get it together."
"4","Great instructors, spacious well equipped gym. My 4 yr old daughter attends weekly in the firecrackers class. I love that they have many different class times to choose from. They offer gymnastics classes for every age and experience level, cheerleading, adult gym time, parties, and different camps throughout the year. I'm so glad I found this place for my daughter, she absolutely loves coming here!"
"2","This was my 3rd time trying to win any money at this place.  What a rip!  Didn't win a thing.  The sad thing is that the Station Casino's are geared towards the locals.  They don't even give any play anymore.  Just keep taking money from the people who live there to build more casino's...\n\nTwo stars for Fatburgers within the casino."
"1","We are LOCALS. Station Casinos SUPPOSELY love locals. We are not pleased. We were ripped off by a bartender. I will NEVER walk into that dump again. GAME OVER."
"1","Texas Station or bust -I'LL TAKE BUST\n\nTEXSH#T Station - I use Yelp all of the time, but have never before left a review.  I am writing this one while in my room at Texas Station.  PLEASE heed my warning and don't stay here!  This place is disgusting!  There is a stench outside of raw sewage that permeates throughout the hotel and smells sooooo bad it was hard to sleep in the room with window shut and AC running.  We were forced to stay here with son's hockey team and even for one night it is AWFUL!!!!!!  Spoke to the manager and he ignored me and said I am only one who complained of the stench.  I doubt it since every parent on our team has complained when they step outside how awful the smell is.  The sink, tub and shower  have such slow drains that you are standing in 6 inches of water before you realize that yes, the drain is open!  If there was actually any water pressure, tub and sink would overflow before water drained out.    They ought to implode this place, but it is in such a bad area that no one would buy the property!  Any positive reviews are obvious plants by hotel staff.  Y'all Come Back Now - I think NOT..."
"3","No bad room. Ideal size for two people with king size bed.  Looking forward to show tonight. Clean with plenty of amenities."
"2","I have came here a few times to play craps.   Some of the dealers are extremely rude.. I dont know how they make it through there shift with out getting knocked out.   \nBuffet is okay..  oyster bar is great. Movie theater are decent"
"3","I love this place, not sure why but hey it's Texas ;) this is simply my best buffet. They have Mexican, Italian, Asian and American...everything I like. I have always had a great dining experience at the Texas buffet and will be back, time after time!"
"5","I simply have to write about Neil Smith's Vegas Guitars Custom Shop.  I have many guitars, and have been disappointed that I could not find a high quality luthier to address setup work on instruments.  I am no longer disappointed!  I found Neil Smith using an Internet search, and found his site to be of interest, since I had a Les Paul which seemed to have some high frets, but I was too afraid to take it anywhere local.  I set up a time to bring the guitar in, you can't just 'walk in,' as his shop is small, a one man operation, plus his assistant, Susi, who is also wonderful!  When I got to the shop, I was astounded at Neil's obvious attention to detail.  He was anxious to discuss all aspects of guitars with me, and his years of experience gave me that \""warm fuzzy feeling\"" I'd never found in a Las Vegas luthier.  While I had not been expecting to have this particular guitar receive a total setup, after talking to Neil, I was convinced that that is exactly what it needed.  Not to say I was talked into something, just that his logic made complete sense to me.\n\nI was not in a hurry to get the guitar back, but I got a call in less than a week, telling me it was ready.  Now, I must tell you that this guitar already had super low action, even with the fret problem.  I had not expected that the action could have gotten any lower.  But it was, indeed, amazingly lower!  The nut slots were perfect, the frets were crowned and smoothed and look like jewelry.  It felt like a different guitar, and this from an instrument that was already outstanding!  \n\nI have taken one other instrument to Neil, a Gibson Historic Korina Explorer, and it, too, got the same setup, simply perfect!  I plan on having many more of my guitars set up by Mr. Smith.  Oh, and if you're in the market for a new, custom guitar, he does that, too.  Spectacular work, from the few of those I've had the privilege to see.\n\nIn the interest of complete transparency, after my first experience, I've since done some photography work for some of Mr. Smith's guitars.  However, this took place only after that first Les Paul was completed, and had no bearing on how well that guitar work was performed, or on my opinion of that work."
"2","Staff is nice and friendly but the car wash did a terrible job. They had employees dry my car but when I got home I discovered spots all over. I'll stick to Fabulous Freddy's from now on."
"1","I was there today and there was only one person running the store. After 15min trying to find what I needed with no help I went to the check stand and there was a former employee complaining with a store associate about how bad it was to work there and that she had quit her job there, and I just wanted to buy my stuff and leave but the only checker was busy with another customer. Point is there are people who really want to work for this company and do a great job, but when employers become picky and will only hire because of  your looks or your friends or employees with benefits, the business will suffer badly.  This Petco is dying a slow death because of very bad business practices. It wont do any good to contact the EEO about this, they just turn the other way. Sorry Petco you've lost my business permanently!"
"3","This place gets a 3 star because they've never blown my socks off with anything, but I've never had experience with them that made me want to quit pizza. It's pretty close to my house and my nephew loves pizza so I'm here a decent amount. They're very consistent, very friendly and my food is always ready on time. On the single time my order was messed up, they were very quick about fixing it,  which was majorly appreciated. To be honest I have nothing bad to say about them at all. They get the job done"
"1","As usual they slop a whole bunch of secret sauce so you can't taste the beef or the rest of the sandwich.  I had the new advertised Rueben and sure wasn't impressed."
"5","Probably in my top 10 things I have eaten in Vegas. I love the Bobbie and probably get one every other week. I did branch out and get a Slaw B Joe and that was unreal too."
"3","This place is small, located in the strip mall on Craig, next to the Pets Mart. After picking up some doggy items my boyfriend and I stopped here to grab some sandwiches to go on a Saturday afternoon.\n\nI went in to order while my boyfriend kept our four-legged friend busy outside where they have some tables set up for out-door eating. Um, too bad it stinks outside right around the area of the store though. Definitely not appetizing to eat sandwiches around a sewer-like smell.\n\nI have given Capriotti's a 5-Star Review before, but this was kind of \""meh\"". I'm bumping it up to 3-Stars though because the Bobbie was yummy per usual. Unlike a lot of people, I'm not a regular at Capriotti's because I'm more of a Port of Subs girl for my go-to sandwich. However, Capriotti's hits the spot sometimes.\n\nThis location is tiny by the way and there's not much seating to speak of inside. Also, the set up to pay/get your sandwich/get your drinks is a little clumsy to say the least."
"5","Had the carne asada burrito. Excellent service from Ernesto and Gabe. I like the fresh made chips and salsa."
"1","I currently go to LVAC but my dad goes to 24 hour fitness. When he came to town he wanted to take me to one. So we went to this one and were sad we did. \n\nFirst strike: They refused to let me as a guest try the gym without paying. Seriously ten dollars. Weird because I thought every gym had a 7 day pass to try the gym. Nope.\n\nSecond strike: He told my dad he needed to sign the parent/guardian portion of my guest paper. I was like I'm 28 and the reception guy said oh you look really young. Seriously I don't look like I'm 16. He was also very rude about it. I wanted to say \""dude not only do I get paid a whole lot more than you but I have my flippin masters so suck it\"".\n\nThird strike: I was trying to figure out out to watch the TV since there wasn't a plug in on my machine. Tried to find another employee to ask but no one was around. Of 3 of there TVs were out anyway. OH and no FANS!!!!!\n\nMy advice go to LVAC this place was so unfriendly."
"2","Also known as stab mart in the military circle this Walmart is not the best by any means. However, I must admit with the increase of security recently it has made me comfortable with once again shopping there. \nIt has been a welcome change to not have to travel all the way down Craig to the next Walmart to buy things. \n\nThis Walmart does offer some things that other Walmarts' do not normally offer. In example, around holiday times and season changes you can snag some great clearance items. They almost always have some kind of clearance specials going on in buggies along the backside of the cashier stations and have a clearance aisle behind the jewelry department. \n\nA couple of downsides to this Walmart is that the service is very limited. They have minimum cashiers and their deli department always takes forever to service you. However, the service you get is rarely bad once you get it. The people tend to be friendly.  \n\nI would also never recommend buying produce there. Their fruits and vegetables go bad super quick. During strawberry season I purchased two large flats of strawberries for a dessert I was making. The next day when I opened my 2 flats I found that 90% of my strawberries were ruined and molded toward the bottom. I had looked the day before and had not seen this. I have also had this issue with some of the bread products I have bought there so beware on fresh products. \n\nOverall, this Walmart could be better. There are some things such as cleanliness that could still be improved but in the 3 years I have lived in the area I have seen major improvements to what it was previously."
"2","I'm only giving this location 2 stars for being open 24 hours and having merchandise although I'd rather go with Eh, Me thinks NOT!  \n\nI absolutely HATE this location. I refuse to even shop here unless I am in dire need, which I make sure doesn't happen. \n\n This place is so Ghetto, it's dirty and there is no customer service. Spare yourself, if you live in this area travel over to the 215 and Decatur location which is cleaner, quiet and a lot less hassle."
"5","Was recently in town on business and stopped by for lunch. Pad See Ewe Shrimp. It was amazing !!! Good portion size as well.  I liked the food so much I went back the next day and tried the Pad Thai - equally as good !!  I will definitely come back here on my next trip."
"2","This location may be too busy to get some real service.  The last couple of times I've gone my orders have been messed up.  They have two kinds of fries, but even if you ask for fat ones your getting skinny.  Don't bother asking for condiments when ordering because they are not going to be there when you get your food.  Maybe it's just too busy for them to get it right."
"3","My guy had his Christmas party here.\nWe had the dining room exclusively to us.\nWe were served buffet style. With salad, (ranch or italian) \nchicken tenders, and chicken wings (with hot sauce available)\nspaghetti, chicken Parmesan , and toast.\n\nI thought the food was fair..It was decent. The chicken was cooked well..Tender and juicy. There just wasn't any WOW factor to any of it.\n\nThe service staff was nice and attentive. However, I just think that their drinks are slightly overpriced. I ordered a margarita, which was VERY strong, and my guy ordered a beer. Some how, these two drinks came out to $11.50"
"4","Sadly in this part of own there are not too many steakhouses and over time even restaurants have been going under.  This Outback's food has been consistently good and the service is always on point."
"5","Yes, you can find a cheaper tire. I like this place because they offer a warranty and a bunch of other services with your tire purchase.\n\nAnother great thing - I was literally out of there in less than 15 minutes! Extra star for their awesome service!"
"4","I just bought my third set of tires here.  The price is always good compared to other competitors, and the service is swift and friendly.  On the phone, the manager said my 4 Michelin tires would be at the store in one hour, and I would be out the door in 30 minutes.  I would receive a $100 rebate to boot.\n\nI arrived at the business in 1 hour and 15 minutes; all new tires were already there; and, despite about 10 people already in the waiting room, all tires were quickly mounted on my car and I was out the door in 29 minutes, with the $100 rebate processed online by me without any glitches within an hour after that.  So why the loss of half a star?\n\nI was asked by the manager if I had picked up a complimentary bottle of cold water, and I responded that I had helped myself to a free bottle, but it was not cold.  Although several salesmen were moving about, no one had apparently noticed that the refrigerator was totally empty; only warm bottles rested in cases on top.  As I was leaving, I saw an employee start to restock the refrigerator with water bottles.\n\nMore importantly, when my car was returned to me I noticed that visible white lines (probably from sealant) had streaked all four tires.  It took me less than 5 minutes to wash all the streaks off with water at a nearby gas station.  But it should be obvious to the service techs that when a car owner spends several hundred dollars to buy new mounted tires, he or she would like to see them looking better upon receipt than the old worn ones that were just removed.  I feel that the technicians should spend a few extra minutes making sure that the tires are properly detailed before presenting a car for return--even if that might throw off the 30-minute promise a bit.  Speed is much less important than mounting and tightening the tires properly and presenting a nice-looking final product.  \n\nI know these particular tires were all properly mounted and tightened because I just arrived intact in southern California without incident after driving at high speeds from North Las Vegas in the middle of the night (to beat the heat) following an enjoyable UYE at Settebello's in Henderson.  So, I highly recommend this store to others overall, despite the two minor gripes just expressed."
"1","DO NOT SHOP HERE!  My wife bought hair for my daughter, and the size was not what was indicated on the package.  They refuse to allow a return or even an exchange because they have a no return policy.  We are out over $100."
"1","Ordered a pizza to go very light on toppings and sauce asked to reorder said no not very good customer service"
"5","UNBELIEVABLE!  I'm not talking about the prices!  Forget the fact that a suit is $5 and they do it onsite!  I am a magician and have some tough suits to clean with special pockets and all sorts of stuff.  The real problem is that my suits are made of shiny material with a really tight special weave.  Stains are hard to get off.  The first time I went in they didn't notice there were a few stains that stayed on (you have to look at them in the light at an angle anyway to see through the shine of the suit sometimes.)  They happily and gladly redid it twice, until the spots were all off!  When it came time to pay (The stains and suit are my fault not theirs) they asked for $5.  I thought they were joking!  All I can say is GO HERE.  I've paid $25 to $45 at expensive places and the service was not this good!  These people are amazing!"
"4","I remember when Krispy Kreme Doughnuts opened on the west coast.  I remember these doughnut shops were found in almost every city.  One thing about a Krispy Kreme, the quality and taste is consistent.  \n\nFirst from the inside, you get to witness how a Krispy Kreme donut is actually made.  It's actually pretty cool to watch the process. Because of the assembly line process, it's no wonder why their donuts are always consistent.  \n\nService here has always been great.  When it comes to their donuts, the glazed is what they are known for.  \n\nTIP:  Whether you're going ordering inside or drive thru, request for their fresh batch. Nothing beats a fresh hot glazed Krispy Kreme Doughnut."
"1","Crappy service."
"3","I recently went to this restaurant to celebrate my coworkers birthday. I have never had any problems with Applebee's; however, this particular time, I ordered the shrimp and spinach salad and found some type of plastic in my salad. Both the manager and waitress apologized for the incident and were very quick to fix the problem. I was offered a new salad (which I took to go because my coworkers had finished their meal already) and when the food was brought out to me, the manager came back again to apologize. My meal was also free. I gave them a 3 because of how both the manager and waitress quickly fixed the problem. I don't think it was their fault but rather the fault of the cooks who were preparing the foods. My salad was also very good!"
"2","Wife and I had dinner on 9/18/13. Usual service was good for the establishment. We tried the new additions to the menu. I had the Honey Pepper steak and the wife had the Honey Chicken Shrimp. The honey really overpowered the dish. The steak was cooked how I ordered. I tried the wife's shrimp and thought I was eating candy. This dish will never be ordered again. The onions and jalape\u00f1os were smothered in the honey syrup. It should have been fried and placed on the steak after it was cooked. That's how it looked on the menu. On a scale of 1-10 I rate this dinner a 2. This Applebee's is In my neighborhood and we will keep going but will not be trying any new dishes especially if honey is added."
"2","Pretty bad.  I was given 2 Applebee's gift certificates, meaning I've been forced there multiple times.\n\nThe Food: It's typical Applebee's food, not great, just good...although, my coveted artichoke dip was cold last time.\n\nAlcohol:  The bartender's suck, I ordered a \""Long Beach\"" two separate times and the first time it tasted purely of tequila (WTF?), the second time I ordered it with a kicker (that the bartender recommended) but it tasted purely of sugar...and I don't mind sugary drinks but this was bad.\n\nThe Service: Probably the best part of the restaurant, very friendly in my experience (the reason for the second star).\n\nManagement: incredibly unorganized, managers clearly disliked their jobs, one told us how ghetto the clientele is...which is probably true considering some of the stories I've heard...\n\nIn essence, the food is hit or miss, the alcohol sucks, and literally most of the management hates their lives...do yourself a favor and go somewhere where there's a little TLC put into the place..."
"2","In person, the staff can seem friendly or helpful. But over the phone, they don't even bother. They've called me to show up early only to switch doctors on me. The office isn't very clean. I had hoped to never go back, but they wouldn't respond to prescription refill requests and I had to go in person to fix the situation. First they told me I would need to come in and be seen every three months for my refills, but when I began to question this they folded and gave me my prescription. They seem like they want to force you to have as much done as possible to line their pockets with your insurance (hopefully) money. I'm back to hoping I never need to go back."
"5","This FBO is about as good as it gets...especially for a county owned facility.\n\nEver since this ramp and terminal were remodeled it is the only place we have gone.  I think i have only been into KLAS once since then.\n\nMost think it is too far from the strip, but honestly it is only a 10 minute drive.  For how low the ramp fee is, and the fuel price, we are more than happy not to pay hundreds at KLAS each night just to save a 10 minute drive.  The fuel price is also worlds lower than vegas.  Even in a small jet...if you are taking only a few hundred gallons, then add in the ramp fees, we are saving around a thousand dollars every trip.\n\nEvery employee we have met is been super helpful.  The line guys are always there to help...and let me tell you, when there is a big event in Vegas this place can be hoppin and they still manage to give you a piece of attention.\n\nThe staff on the inside is helpful too.  We used to come here A LOT, but we don't make it to vegas near as often and Donna and Scott still always treat us like we are in big iron instead of just a small CJ.\n\nThey aren't open 24 hours, which has been a problem a few times, but the security officer that is on duty is one of the best i have seen anywhere.   Usually these guys are unfriendly and wont get out of their golf cart.  this guy acts like he owns the facility, and helps you out with anything he can.  It is refreshing to see someone who takes so much pride in their job.  I wish i could remember his name to give him due credit.\n\nTHERE IS NO FUEL AFTER HOURS.  this is the only negative.  We have had to make some special routing arrangements at other local airports to get fuel before we could make it home because of this.  I would say this is the only negative and honestly as long as you put in the fuel order before you leave (or call in during normal hours) it's no big deal.\n\nthere is a restaurant upstairs and their food is pretty good.  Not the best i have had, but not too shabby for a small airport place.  I had the roast beef once, and ham and cheese a couple times and both were good.   The restaurant hours are very limited though, which is annoying but that doesnt effect the FBO score since it is a seperate place.\n\nanyways, i guess the point to all this is.....why would you fly into KVGT or KLAS when you have this option??   yeah...i can't think of a good reason either.\n\nN525HS"
"5","I wanted to take off a star for the weird bendy line that I always have to wait in when I go through the drive thru. However, the truth is that if I simply parked my car and walked my lazy a** inside, I would not have to wait.\n\nSpeaking of their drive thru, wow. You could be in a line all the way out to Eastern and you would be through that line in 5 minutes. They really have an operation going on there. This is what happens when you have the budget to hire sufficient amounts of employees.\n\nOne time this one girl was kinda mean to me...but I can't blame McDonalds.  It felt like an anger caused by something such as a breakup or a stressful issue with not paying rent, so I let it go.\n\nHAVE YOU HAD THEIR FRIES?!?!!?  I don't care what people say. I think are putting crack in those. Salt and crack. If one day down the line we find out that McDonalds fries were so good because they were laced with something, I won't be shocked."
"3","I will start out with the disclaimer that I lived in Italy for 6 glorious months and, consequently, I am a total Italian food snob. I found out about this place from a friend and I was especially pleased to find them on restaurant.com. So my husband and I printed our $50 gift certificate and headed out on a Friday night. I started the meal with the best cosmo I have ever had, it was definitely strong but I didn't taste any alcohol. The bartender is masterful! I then moved on to the bread basket on the table. The regular bread was delicious and warm. There was also an herb, almost pizza looking bread that I was not very fond of, but I am sure somebody enjoys it. I did notice that other tables were getting bruschetta as well as bread, but I got the feeling they were \""regulars,\"" but it made me feel left out! We moved on to appetizers. I had the caprese salad, which has roasted peppers and onions on it. I was surprised how well the whole thing worked, given its non-traditional nature. I would definitely recommend it! For the main courses, I had the papardelle with filet and my husband had the trout special. The pasta was delightful and the filet was melt in your mouth delicious, but the dish was missing something. It was earthy and rustic but there was a flavor profile missing for sure. The trout was well cooked, but the skin of the fish was not at all crispy and we felt it should have been. It came with a side of pasta that was delicious! Since we had the restaurant.com coupon we decided to go all out and get a dessert. We decided to go out on a limb and try the Sicilian cannoli. The cannoli was almost inedible. It has an overwhelming lemon flavor and is just very off-putting texturally. \n\nThe service was wonderful, until the end of the meal. The restaurant had filled up very fast and people were asking to be seated in our server's section. The poor man was running from table to table! It took us over 15 minutes to get someone to swipe our credit card so we could leave, but other than that small ordeal the service was impeccable. Overall, it was a mixed bag for us. I have had better Italian food in Las Vegas, but I may give this another try sometime in the future."
"4","I've been here twice now and it is phenomenal. I'm so in love with pasta, and I would way way way rather eat a $20 plate of homemade pasta from a locally owned business than eat a $15 plate of Olive Garden pasta with bottom of the barrel ingredients, crapola service, and a host of corporate BS. \n\nThe first time I went was spring Restaurant Week. I have to say that I wasn't overtly impressed with the meal for the price, but I did enjoy it enough to buy the Groupon and try it again. Last night I had the fig appetizer--goat cheese, balsamic, wrapped in proscuitto ($14 for 3, noooot worth it but still good) and the butternut squash ravioli. That dish is absolutely superb. The portion size is perfect. My mom had a marsala special which was also absolutely incredible....we cleaned our plates and then some. Dessert was the tiramisu, which I didn't really have room for and didn't need, but I still enjoyed the dessert like I do. \n\nI would definitely come here again or recommend it to someone who wanted good, high-quality Italian food and didn't want to venture to the Strip for similar quality at twice the price."
"3","We had a $40 Groupon for the restaurant and went last Saturday evening.  Our reservation was for 5:15 and we were right on time.  The place was almost empty at the time and we were shown to our table.\n\nThere is a Yelp check in offer for free bruschetta but you can't double dip on the coupons--either the Yelp or the Groupon--so of course, we went with the Groupon.\n\nWe were brought iced teas and a bread basket shortly after being seated and ordering.  The bread basket was a let down.  The one piece of lavash was more like pressed cardboard and the two types of focaccia were merely OK.  We did not get butter but rather a mixture of olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  I have to remember in Italian restaurants to tell them to hold the balsamic.  It's just to sweet for me.  Give me plain olive oil and a salt shaker.\n\nWe ordered fried artichoke for an appetizer.  It was very good.  The dipping sauce was quite good.  There were 6 pieces of artichoke.  For mains, we each ordered ravioli.  I got the Lobster stuffed ravioli with lobster sauce--a house special for the evening.  My wife got the ravioli stuffed with butternut squash.  We both enjoyed our ravioli.  The serving size was just right.\n\nFor dessert, I ordered a cannoli and my wife got the vanilla cr\u00e8me brul\u00e9e.  Both were good.  The cannoli was fairly standard but I didn't taste any of the pistachio nuts that were supposed to be in the cream.  The cr\u00e8me brul\u00e9e was the winner of the two desserts.\n\nI think Gaetano's is overpriced.  It only makes sense to go here when you have a coupon of some kind.  Service was good.  It was pointed out when the bill was brought that gratuity had automatically been added because of the Groupon.  I'm not a fan of that.  Actually, the server lost because he got a lesser tip than he would have gotten had I made the decision and not the restaurant.  A good meal but a bit of a drive from Summerlin.  I can get equal or better Italian closer and for a better price."
"5","My friend/ex-roomie and I love this spot for our QT dates. We've always had a great experience but this last one was the best by far. We had a restaurant.com certificate, so our bill for a bottle of wine, an appetizer and two entrees came to $40 each (including tip). That's a great deal for amazing food and fine dining service. \n\nWe got the eggplant app this time, and it was so good. It's like a cheesy crunchy layered veggie lasagna with light tomato sauce. We devoured it. I couldn't decide between the mezzalune or the special italian sausage and shitake mushroom ravioli so the server offered to have the kitchen make me a half order of each. I was amazed by this generous offer!  And when I got my food, I was so happy as each dish was so delicious. I ate my entire plate.  My roomie got the fettucini alfredo and she too finished her entire plate.  \n\nThis is just one of my fave restaurants when I want to splurge on calories. If you have a Groupon or restaurant.com, it's a steal for the quality of food and service you get."
"3","Way too expensive for the quality & quantity of food you get. I had purchased a groupon & we went last Friday. The place was not very busy which was surprising for a Friday night but according to some of the other yelp reviews, not unusual. \nWe ordered the calamari & fried artichokes for our appetizers. The calamari was $13 & the portion was tiny. The fried artichokes were either canned or jarred artichokes which I could not believe. At a restaurant like that, it's completely ridiculous to use any kind of canned ingredients. My husband got the veal with mushrooms & I got one of their specials, Chilean Sea Bass. My husbands veal was nothing special & the sauce had a weird texture to it. My sea bass was good but the accompanying side of orzo with different veggies in some type of sauce was very boring & unimaginative. \nVery forgettable meal & we won't be going back. I can think of at least 3 other Italian restaurants that blow this place out of the water."
"2","Dang how in the heck can you work in a theater and not know about the movies playing.  Its 2011, please stop being cheap and have paper towels in the bathroom. Popcorn was ok i should have went to Popcorn girl and brought my own(pissed i couldn't really eat it due to the smell). The only thing that was good was the movie hangover 2. I enjoyed the movie but since it was packed and some *ick-head had his feet all on my seat. (yeah i gave him the eye several times but I guess he was to dum to figure out  the deal-he got me on a good night). The smell was so foul he had my eyes and nose burning. (Man he needs to spray some big Oomp spray or something on those dogs, and the theater @the same time.) All and all i may need to continue to drive to fiesta or go early on tuesday.  \n\nThey better be glad i don't know any movies man around here- because I could have gotten the 2 for 1 deal on the streets.(jk)"
"1","Overpriced with a moody staff. Far more expensive then south point with bad service.  It was dead when I went, and for good reason. GVR is the only theatre I've ever had problems with the staff. Plus it's ridiculously over priced (even though all theatres are) at most theaters it's about 45$ for me and my boyfriend to see a movie and get snacks but here it was 55$ and we didn't even get candy. My boyfriend got a hot dog that the staff shoved into the bag so the bun got all ripped up and they shorted him on his 6$ small drink. It had an inch and a half of space left when he recieved it. I wouldn't normally care that it wasn't all the way full but when you pay 6$ for a drink you expect it to be filled. Then the girl checking us out had no people skills and kept looking at us like she wanted us to leave.  But we finally get into the movie and it's a good movie but the usher kept patrolling constantly through the movie and he was distracting. He walked through the theater at least 4 times clicking his counter each time. The movie was great but I don't think I'll be back at GVR again I'm gunna stick with south point and save 10$ and not have to deal with an usher who doesn't know how to do his job well enough to not distract people from the movie they payed good money for. It might have been nice and clean but the service was severely lacking."
"4","Fast cheap Mexican food. Very addicting. Love the chicken bowl from there. Pretty decent healthy option as well, as long as you don't add the sour cream and cheese. Only problem I have with Chipotle is that the amount of food you get each time is different, depending on the server."
"2","We love Chipotle and this location used to be a great weekday lunch destination. Lately we've tried it on the weekends and probably won't go to this location anymore. The food is still OK, but the service has gotten slow and the restaurant is generally messy or they let the fountain drinks run dry. One time we had to stand and wait while an employee held up the whole line as she ordered food for her family members - and for some reason this confused the rest of the staff and they had to re-make a couple of other customers' orders. Maybe they don't have a weekend manager? Not sure. The location on Las Vegas Boulevard & Warm Springs is where the A-Team workers are. We'll keep going there instead."
"2","This is the worst chipotle that I have been too! The service wasn't all that good, and the portions were the smallest I've experienced. \nThe chipotle Location on Sahara is much better!"
"5","I have to admit I have minimal yoga experience (basically prior to this I just did the p90x yoga video.). I just go to the beginner classes and they are great. The classes aren't so packed that the instructors don't get time to come over and help with your poses (trust me I always get special treatment as I'm particularly retarded.). I go primarily for relaxation but I always end up with sweat pouring off of me. Highly recommended!"
"5","Found this place on Yelp by accident and what a happy accident it was!  Arrived around 7:30 on a Friday night and there was a very short wait. We waited in the front by where they make pizzas and that was interesting to watch - also looked delish.  We got the last table in the back which was very cozy, warm bread with olive oil and vinegar to dip,  Waiter Dave Z was delightful and joked with us throughout the meal, as well as being very attentive.  Wine all around - now we were set to read the menu.\n\nI had the Chef's signature eggplant and it was outstanding.  My husband had the penne pasta with broccoli and chicken, which was also excellent.  My friend had spaghetti with meatballs which was very good, too.  But my friend Coleen had the sausage and mushroom rigatoni which was out of this world.  All the portions were heaping and I was amazed to see her all but finish it - I have NEVER seen her eat that much!!  She's an awesome cook in her own right and could not stop saying how incredible this dish was.\n\nThe owner came over and shared some of his thoughts and stories about his business - this was truly like having dinner with an extended family.  We are sad that this place is over 2 hours from home but we plan to stop in each time we have to visit Vegas.  Had no room for cannoli so we took one home and shared it for breakfast.  Yummmmmmm.\n\nHere's the hard part - I easily give this place 5 stars and that's uncommon for me.  Usually something about the restaurant turns me off or isn't what I thought it should be.  Not Buon Gusto.  And if I give it 5 stars then I'll have a longer wait next time I go because all of you want to try it, too.  Hmmmmm.  My karma would be all FUBAR if I gave this place anything less than a five - so have at it!"
"5","I come from a big Italian family and I am grown to my family's cooking. I must say that it is very difficult to find a place that serves food as good as Buon Gusto. I have been to so many restaurants throughout my life. I lived on the east coast and the west coast and been to so many places that just served mediocre food. Some of it was good, but not great. I remember my cousin went to Buon Gusto and she told me about it. She said to me that she could not believe how authentic-tasting the food was, and how it was just like our family's cooking. My mom is such a wonderful cook so I know the difference between Italian food and great Italian food. Everytime I come here, everything is on the money. Every detail, ingredient, and server is incredible. The place is so welcoming, warm, and so intricate. The food is TO DIE for. And I don't know about you but if the food is this good, I don't care how much I pay for it. This place has yet to disappoint me or anyone that I recommended it to. I honestly feel like I am eating right out of my mother's kitchen. Incredible food and service, and I highly recommend this place to anyone who wants great quality and great, authentic Italian food. You will not be disappointed at all. I will be coming here for as long as I am in Vegas. There is no other Italian place in Vegas that can fully incorporate true  quality Italian food the way these guys can."
"4","Finally had the time to try this place since it's been in my bookmarks for quite a while. It has a really casual feel to it and was really clean. Their menu had a lot of different options of pastas, entrees, pizzas, salads and sandwiches including 8 lunch specials for $8, Tuesday- Friday, 11-4pm. I wanted to try them but I  was craving pasta and for some reason I'm really weird and feel like if I have pasta without any meat/chicken (what all their pasta lunch specials were ), I feel like my meal is incomplete. I know I know, I'm weird lol. Sooo I ended up trying the sausage and mushroom rigatoni and my boyfriend tried the chicken trieste. It took a little long, about 20 minutes for them to come out when there was only us and another small table dining. Oh and all entrees come with a salad and fresh baked  bread but just like Jill D. said in her review they didn't bring us any bread so we asked for it since my boyfriend's entree didn't come with any pasta and he needed something to soak up all the delicious sauce! Definitely ask for it if they don't bring you any, it's a little bread loaf of perfection; warm, chewy and comes with garlic evoo! Yum Yum!!  The main thing I was surprised about and not expecting were their rich and creamy sauces and the fact that they definitely were not skimpy with it or their ingredients. And thank goodness their sauces actually stuck onto the pasta and didn't slide right off.  Usually when I order a type of sausage pasta in other places,  I'll get like 5 pieces of sausage perfectly placed on top and we call it a day but this pasta here was LOADED!!!! I feel like there was 3 links of chopped sausage in there and same with the mushrooms! The pasta also was cooked well, not too mushy or too hard. Sometimes I feel like Goldilocks describing porridges lol but really, it was \""just right\""! :) My boyfriend's dish was also a little plate of perfection! The flavor of the sauce was just soo delicious! Yes I know, I'm sprung on their sauces lol. It had a really nice wine flavor and was loaded with artichoke hearts and mushrooms on top of two chicken breasts. \nWhy is there missing one star you ask? Well, it's because of the service. Everyone was really nice and professional yet I had to request our waiter to fill my water after waiting a few minutes and after he visited our table and didn't notice. I also had to request for the bread. I hate requesting for things, I mean if it says it comes with it, then just bring it out! I also had to request extra silverware when he took it away with our salads but didn't bring any new ones to us with our entrees. However, we didn't have to request our check lol. Don't get me wrong, these people weren't just standing around being lazy, they were all doing tasks and were hard working  but you can't forget about your customers! Overall, better than I expected and will definitely be back especially for the price! :)"
"1","Chicken(Country)-Fried Steak, To Go!\nDrive Home took approximately 45 seconds. Upon opening container and cutting first piece, the entire breading-type covering, which was over and inch thick, completely came off the McDonald's Hamburger-sized beef patty. I even had gravy on the side, so it wasn't soggy from the gravy. \n\nAre you kidding me? How difficult is it to fuck up a Chicken Fried Steak?\n\nTotally ruined and a waste of time & money. Threw it away!"
"1","We asked for table side guacamole and our waiter said \""I'll make it for you then bring it out\"" then I said \""no, we want TABLE SIDE GUACAMOLE\"" he again said \""trust me on this. .. I'll make it for you then bring it out and I won't charge you the table side price.. we are too backed up in the kitchen.\"" I told him to go tell his manager what he told me or I was going to tell him.... judging by the managers reaction when he came to our table... he most likely told all his servers to do this on their shift. Eat at the one on Las Vegas Blvd or go elsewhere."
"1","Yikes,  the memories of DQ.  You know, ice cream, treats, a nice nostalgic feeling of the past for kids.  What happened to this place?  I haven't a clue.\n\n1.  Ambiance - Been here several times now, and always the same, bland, not exciting.\n\n2.  Service - Hmmm, perhaps they should turn this one to a self service facility, this would definitely improve the service. A guy was there waiting for his kids sundae. The servers assisted and prepared orders for two other customers that came in after. The guy goes to the server to remind them, they said it was almost ready. Then I put my order in, the guy starts to make mine and I remind him about the guy's kid from three orders ago. So, they start to make it and it takes like 10 seconds. Poor kid.\n\n3.  Service Part 2 - they make my order and the shakes are like slightly thicker than milk. I said no whip and guess what, whip. I ordered one dipped cone and guess what, i got two. I guess you can say that this ying yang approach is balanced???\n\n4.  Air Con - What the heck happened here? No air, no fans, hot and stuffy?  Hmmm, what would a normal store do? Offer free dipped cones!\n\n5.  Service Part 3 - to use the toilets, you have to get a key from the cashier. Guess what, they cannot find the key.  I wonder what the dealio is since this place is usually empty anyway, no need to manager the bathroom.\n\nThis is not a bad place, the cones and stuff are decent, but the service and customer care is not in existence."
"1","What a mess. \nAfter making my pumpkin blizzard. They tried to use a regular soda lid on the large then forgot the whip cream.  Next after asking for whip they forgot the pumpkin spice.  Asian guy working was on the side using his cell.  \nHad to ask for the spice in another container so I could put it on the blizzards myself for the kids.  \nWtf?????  It was soo freakin messy and it looked like an ice cream shoved into a cola container at first. \nThis place needs a serious employee training so they know never to serve something with less quality to the customer."
"3","Fado seems to be the default hangout for my friends and I.  Basically, if we can't think of anywhere else to go, and we don't want to think too hard about it, we go to Fado.  It's close and it's not too pricey.\n\nThe beer selection is not fantastic, as far as I'm concerned.   I end up drinking cider half the time, which is a far cry from the usual ambers I tend to enjoy.  The do have Smithwicks, which is a decent amber, but not much else I'm excited about.  Of course, they've got the British/Irish kinds of beers, but not as many as I'd like to see.\n\nTheir happy hour appetizers are very good, and fairly cheap.  The crab and cheese dip is tasty, as are the beef curry bites and the guinness mac and cheese (all are 3-5 bucks).  \n\nOh, yeah, FYI, there is absolutely nothing healthy at all on the entire menu, so...be aware if you're into that kind of thing.  Tasty, but not healthy.\n\nThe ambiance here is nice, and it's what keeps me coming back.  The bartenders and servers are very friendly, and there's a laid back vibe about the place.   Basically, it's as close to a decent neighborhood Irish pub I'm going to get in Henderson."
"3","I've been to see a lot of urologists.\nA lot.\n\nI'm not a fan of male doctors, but it seems that most of the urologists or kidney specialists in this town are men.\n\nI attempted several times to set up an appointment or consultation using the web form on the website, and never received anything...not a call or an email.\n\nI called on Thursday, after noon, and was able to schedule an appointment for Monday. \n\nWhen I arrived, the staff was polite, and quiet.  \nThe paperwork was a bit much...I was literally filling in paperwork for a half an hour, but I understand that new doctors need to get information.\n\nThe nurse was nice, and made me feel comfortable while I was getting my bladder ultrasound done.\n\nDr. Kaplan was nice.  He seemed a little abrasive at first, but later it seemed he was more...appalled at the fact that previous doctors hadn't done much to help me.\n\nHe's the first urologist to offer me a preventative antibiotic, since I get frequent UTIs.  I'm not 100% sold on taking an antibiotic every day, just because of super bugs, etc, but at least he offered.  No other doctor has done that.\n\nHe's also the first to offer me a medication to help with the other bladder issues I've been having, that are starting to cause problems with my job.  \n\nHis office staff filled in paperwork for me, for help with work.  The woman I worked with was absolutely wonderful.  \n\nI like the office.  I'm not in love with them yet, but I'm always VERY cautious about feeling out doctors and their staff.  I have a follow up appointment next month, so we'll see how they do then, too."
"1","So you're not into gambling and you're not much of a shopper and you're looking for something equally as wasteful to do with your last $20 or $40, set up an appointment at this dermatologist office! \n\nI'm pretty sure the only thing redeeming about this visit was the front office staff that checked me in (shocking for a doctor's office, I know). \n\nI merely wanted to check in with my epidermis, being the sun bather I tend to be in the summer months, I made my appointment. I showed up early and they were able take me in early which was fantastic. \n\nLet's just say that I have sneezed and it has lasted longer than the time the doctor spent \""evaluating\"" my flesh. \n\nUnless your face, or body is covered in undefinable matter, painful to look at or abnormal in a major way, don't waste your time or cash at this joint. \n\nNo care, no time and no concern was shown to me during this visit; rolling down my car windows and letting go of the $40 would have even sufficed as a more rewarding experience in my opinion."
"2","Not very impressed. The crust tastes like something you would get from a bargain frozen pizza. The sauce was not very flavorful and didn't have any spices to it. I had to add a bunch of crushed red peppers to get some kick into it. The cheese was good and tasted real, but the mushrooms seemed like they were from a can. $23.78 for a 13\"" medium pizza to go, was way more than this was worth. Disappointed."
"4","What a great pizza!! We had the thick crust pepperoni, sausage and garlic pie with a couple of appetizers. First appetizer was \""Bosko sticks\"", they are cheese filled bread sticks topped with garlic seasoning and served with marinara for dipping. The second appetizer was an order of chicken wings. Every thing was great, pizza was very flavor full with crispy crust. The Bosko sticks were great and the chicken wings were cooked perfectly.  If it was closer to my home I would be a regular for sure. I do agree with some on here about the price how ever, 65 bucks for an 18\"" pie two orders of the cheese bread sticks and 12 wings!!!!  OOFFF"
"2","Went here for drinks on a Saturday night and the place was not extremely busy but for some reason it was like pulling teeth to have my beer filled.  Maybe the bartenders were having an off night but after 5 minutes of the bartenders walking by i had to flag them down for a cocktail.  \n\nWe ordered 12 of the boneless wings that came out extremely quickly...maybe 2 quickly.  The chicken totaly dry, the sauce didn't even seem present.  Perhaps said chicken had been from a previous order or cooked before ordered. \n\nIf you're just looking for a place to watch a game and do not care about service, food, and drinks this would be a great choice as they did have many games on."
"4","My boyfriend and I were torn on where to go for a bite to eat and have a casual nite out.... and we decided Buffalo Wild Wings- this was a great choice! We had a fun time! We sat at the bar and Jason was our bartender/waiter, he was great! We had great conversation, and then my boyfriend and I were able to play the silly trivia game they have and enjoy some good competition. The food was good, but chicken wings are their specialty here- so they know how to make them!"
"4","Hubby and I happened across this place while I was 7 months pregnant and seriously craving some good Chinese eats. We didn't want to go far from our new house, and we found a coupon on our doorstep a few days earlier for free egg rolls with a $10 order, so we thought we'd give China A Go Go a try. Thank heaven for pregnancy cravings!! This is our new go-to Chinese place. Everything is hot fresh and tasty. \n\nThe Hot Garlic chicken is my favorite, and they even substituted vegi chowmein for one of our white rices. Nice!! The Chicken Mu Shu is super yumm, and their prices are on point. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed. :)"
"1","SHUT DOWN as of 3/31/2014 by Southern Nevada Health District for having 46 outstanding demerits. I will most likely never eat there again."
"1","These people butchered our poodle. If I could add a picture to show you how terrible she looks, you would think that these groomers had no formal education and I brought the dog to supercuts for $10 trim. \n\nWe will be taking the poodle to another groomer to fix her haircut and for them to shave the spots that Hap E staff missed. \nThe poor dog is sleeping underneath a pile of blankets because I'm sure it was a traumatic experience and she is exhausted. \n\nThe Rottweiler that we brought was fine, because she just got a bath. Don't go here. If there was a zero star possibility, they would get it.\n\nF rating and the business is run by a bunch of no-talent hacks."
"1","Never once has my prescription been ready when I'm told it's supposed to be.  EVERY SINGLE TIME I'm told it's going to be 10-15 minutes. I don't have time to sit around and wait with two kids in the car. I so wish I wasn't pigeon holed into using this pharmacy. I miss Walgreens!!!"
"4","I live next to a different Smith's so when I walked into this one and saw how neat and clean they keep it, I was jealous! Freshly baked bread, deli counter, friendly employees and even hot soup that you can eat in the store! Wish I lived closer to it :("
"5","Our son was never interested in any sports.  When a friend invited him to an open house at Rico's he really enjoyed it.  For this summer we thought we would give him a few weeks to decide if it was for him.  On his first day of instruction it was clear it meant he fit in somewhere and was welcomed.  Now he's learning respect and honor and his behavior has really improved.  He is not only learning self defense but gaining the confidence that will keep him from being a target to be picked on.  He comes home from school every day with the focus to work on his studies so he can get to class at Rico's Martial Arts.  I could go on and on about the many things our family has gained in such a short time with Ricco's help, but what I love most is how all the instructors and even the parents of all the kids are so pleasant and really make your whole family feel like you are part of something great for all the kids."
"4","It has become quite difficult to find an old school barber shop that uses straight razors.  I'm an old school kind of guy.  It's a haircut, not a spa day.  I don't need my hair massaged and shampoo'd or any of that junk.\n\nVillage Barber does a good job.  I've had 3 different people and all have been fine.  An older gentleman, a man in his forties, and an Asian woman.\n\nRating a barbershop can be kind of hard as everyone who walks in the door has different needs.  But yeah, no problems with this place at all.  The price is reasonable.  The only downside I can think of is that they don't take debit or credit cards."
"1","just ate here tonight. this place sucked big time. everything was so soggy! first off the diet coke was flat and too much syrup. my friend ordered the caterpillar roll and the rice was so soggy. i ordered the cali roll and yuck....too much rice vinegar & crappy fake crab meat....the tempura i could not believe they served me what they did.... the tempura was not crispy at all, it was mushy, almost like it wasn't cooked all the way! the oyako donburi was aight but too much rice and not enough chicken! this place is outrageously over rated! will not go back. Brians Beach is da bes if you want fresh ass sushi!"
"3","I was craving sushi, my fiance was craving teppanayki so Osaka seemed like the perfect place to have both. \n\nI liked how they seemed to purposely make sure each teppanyaki party got it's own table and chef. This could have been because they were mostly empty, but I did appreciate having our own table. \n\nSushi was just OK. It was tightly rolled and they had a nice selection, but the negi hama I had was just OK. Not rotten, not super fresh.. just eh. I did love, however, that they offered half rolls. It was great to be able to get some variety. For ~$15 I was able to try 3 1/2 rolls.. this worked out really well. The rolls with all cooked stuff (shrimp tempura, etc) were great.. but that's hard to screw up. \n\nTeppanyaki was pretty good. Filet mignon was off the hook - seriously the best steak I've had at a  teppanyaki place..very tender and cooked really well. The chicken, sadly, was random end pieces and not too great. Lots of chewy grisley pieces.. eww. The fried rice and veggies were just average. \n\nOverally not a *bad* place , but nothing special. As teppanyaki and sushi are pretty expensive, I'd probably only come back here for the lunch specials. I'm not sure the quality justifies the dinner prices."
"3","Love the teppen grill lunch special! Lunch special comes with salad, soup, fried rice, and your choice of chicken or beef all for $8.95! Definately a good cheap lunch and fillllling! \n\nAs for sushi: MUST HAVE: Roppongi, and Oh My God rolls, they are amazing, other good ones include japanese lasagna and 911 rolls. \n\nSushi can get a little pricey compared to most other places, if you drink definately try the lychee saki! Really good!\n\nSIGN UP FOR THEIR EMAIL TO RECEIVE AN INSTANT 10% OFF.  For larger groups definately worth it!"
"4","Found this restaurant a few years ago when I moved to this area of town. I'm glad to have found a Japanese restaurant actually owned by Japanese! Most of the Japanese places here in Vegas are run by Koreans, which I can't complain about, but I like the authenticity of REAL Japanese food like my mom makes! :) Osaka was also the first Japanese owned restaurant in Vegas!\n\nI love the late night menu. Since Osaka is open until 2am and I'm up late, it works perfect for me! The late night menu is large with great prices! Half size/priced suchi rolls, low priced apps, and great drink specials as well! \n\nSome of my favorite items are: udon, zaru soba, shabu shabu, katsudon, katsu kare, and their selection of fish! Their soups and sauces are very good and similar to how my mom makes!\n\nThe sushi chefs are very nice, friendly and Japanese. They are great at recommending menu items and love how creative they are. \n\nThey feature teppanyaki (table grilling) and tatami tables by request and live music certain days of the week."
"1","We are regulars here. On may 2. 2014  our usual party of five showed up for my sons birthday. Now we love eating here but as we were seated in the back at the teppan table a large cockroach crawled out from the side of the grill and headed toward my daughter....the manager just smiled said he would kill it and moved us to the next table! No offers of any kind followed! This was disgusting and will surely end our  twice monthly dinners there-gross!!!"
"5","Best green tea! Garlic tuna nigiri. Yellowtail w ponzu n jalape\u00f1o nigiri. Wild salmon. Best spicy tuna rolls. Asakusa roll is redic! Dessert great too!!!"
"4","Stopped in with a group of 5 guys who love this place.  We basically told the sushi chefs to have at it and make whatever...everything that came was very good.  Sashimi was very fresh, rolls were excellent with some interesting flavors and the sushi chefs were very fun.  If I could find this place again, I'd certainly come back for the creations."
"5","Great sushi, first place i goto when i get into town, all you can eat is awesome. The staff make you feel wecome and also give some great suggestions if you cannot make up your mind from the vast selections of roll's"
"2","Average food. Lack presentation, ingenuity, and tasty. Taste like something I've picked up from a grocery store."
"3","Looking for a good place to go when you're craving authentic Mexican food but don't want to pay high prices at some Mexican sit-down restaurant or pay really cheap prices for questionable Mexican fare at a fast-food establishment? Search no further because Fausto's is that place plus more. The employees are nice, the food is made-to-order, the menu is simple and inexpensive, and there's a complimentary condiments bar complete with pickled veggies (jalapenos, carrots & onions), fresh cucumber & radish slices, and two types of salsa (mild tomatillo & a spicy red salsa). Sure, the ambiance may be lacking, but that's okay because you can just order your food to-go. You can order food a la carte (located on the menu above the counter) or you can order a combo which comes with an entree and sides of Mexican-style rice & refried beans. The combo menu is posted on the side wall adjacent to the counter, and it is composed of images of the food, making it easier to choose what you want to eat. I've been here multiple times, and everything that I have ordered so far has been good. Here's what I've ordered:\n\nChimichanga combo plate: A humongous flour tortilla burrito stuffed with shredded beef, onions & bell peppers, then fried to golden perfection and topped with sour cream on one half & guacamole on the other, along with a nice layer of melted cheese. The plate comes with a side of rice & refried beans, as well as a small serving of pico de gallo ( I assume to bring some sort of healthy to the dish). \n\nShredded Beef combo plate: The shredded beef is the same concoction as the shredded beef inside the chimichanga, but instead of it being encased in a fried tortilla, the meat is served all by itself with sides of refried beans & rice, and your choice of freshly made corn or flour tortillas, which you can use to make mini burritos. The tortillas are wrapped in foil to keep warm. I prefer the flour tortillas over the corn because they have better texture, are bigger & taste better. Store-bought flour tortillas can't compare to the fresh-made tortillas at Fausto's. \n\nSuper Nachos: Heart-attack on a plate! But so addicting & super good. I usually ask for the toppings (meat of your choice, guacamole, sour cream, lettuce, tomatoes & cheese; I may be forgetting something) on the side to prevent the fried flour tortilla chips from becoming soft. The chips are oily and they layer on the toppings, so be warned- Addicting, yet so bad for you. \n\nTacos: I love the tacos because of the way Fausto's prepares the shell. I think they fry the whole taco after stuffing the tortilla with meat & cheese, resulting in a very crispy shell. They then take the fried taco and add lettuce & a another type of cheese (crumbly, reminiscent of feta). I like to add salsa to the taco, which makes the taco juicy & yummy. \n\nI haven't had a bad experience with Fausto's yet, so I do recommend this place. The next time you're searching for good Mexican food at inexpensive prices and large portions, then stop by Fausto's and try some of their menu items."
"5","I know I gave Roberto's 5 stars but Fausto's is way better. They are just a lot farther away from my house. I love their carne asada and chips and cheese. Great place for a quick bite of tasty and blessedly unhealthy Mexican food."
"1","f I could give them no stars I would, but for the sake of the rating system, one star it is.  While I did like their selection of glasses, the place has less than mediocre service.  The doctor's appointment was fine.  All I wanted to know was if my glasses prescription needed to be increased.  The final bill was for more things than what I needed, which meant I paid for more than what I'd hoped to receive.  Also the glasses I purchased are transition polycarbonate lenses.  Up until a year into it, they were fine.  Since then the transition film has become covered in tiny cracks covering the entirety of both lenses.  Naturally they only guaranteed their work for 1 year.  \nBeware of the transition lenses from this place.  Do your research first! Transitions Optical, the company that created these lenses that darken in sunlightt, says you should get a certificate of authenticity at the time of purchase and are warrantied by Transitions Optical for two years.  I did not receive a certificate of authenticity.  The multitude of tiny cracks going across my transition lenses make things appear blurry, as if I weren't wearing glasses!   I wouldn't advise doing business here.  Although I still like the frames, I'll get my lenses replaced elsewhere and make sure the customer service is better if I should have problems later!"
"5","Staff are very friendly and pleasant. Doctor genuinely cared and did not rush through the appointment . Great eye ware selection, a little pricy, but you get what you pay for. I highly recommend doing business with Seven Hills Vision Center. The office is clean and inviting. I have only one suggestion, and that is to repair or replace the carpet behind the front desk, this is the first thing I noticed when walking in the front door. Everything else was great and state of the art equipment was maintained and in good condition.\n\nIt's great when a business gets it... Customers just want to be treated with respect I know a few businesses that could learn this basic philosophy.\n\nCheers,"
"1","The apartments are very nice but the management rips you off!! It's not worth the money to be there."
"3","Even trying to make an appointment at almost any of the locations never seemed to work with my schedule. ..so I did a walk in at this location while in the area for work. It felt crowded and people kept coming in with appointments, pushing me back in line but it wasn't all that long of a wait. The clinic is small and seems unkept, but the workers I encountered were all nice and did their jobs well. I used the bathroom while I was there...it was in need of a cleaning."
"4","Played this course on day 1 of our 3 day golf adventure for 2013.  \n\nRate we paid was $199.  \n\nCourse has a nice layout just 25 min from the Strip with some scenic views from a bunch of the holes!  Much of the course looks like it could have been a rock quarry!  Lots of nice homes wrapping around the course.  Some challenging terrain!  A very nice Rees Jones Design!\n\nHole # 7 is the Million dollar hole challenge.  Basically you place a wager and if you get it on the green your money is doubled in pro shop gift certs.  If you get a hole in one then you come back for a second chance to hit for a million!  \n\nOnly challenge for us playing was that we were behind a slow group!  \n\nCheck out the Tee mates program if you want a sexy girl riding with you replacing your divots and raking your bunkers all day! :)\n\nOtherwise a great round!"
"3","As a restaurant owner, I am always looking for places to get food/supplies. This place is good for some things, but not for others. Do not go for beverages. There is no deal whatsoever here. Really? A case of vitamin water for $32? It's cheaper buying per bottle at the grocery store with a rewards card. U usually can find deals at Vons, Smiths, etc. for like 10/$10. However they do have items that you can't find at those places like 50lb bag of flour, deep fryer oil, and paper products like take-out containers, 18\""x1000' aluminum foil and quantities of cups etc. Their BBQ sauce selection is a bit lacking, but I am a BBQ sauce freak. The condiment aisle is my favorite one in a grocery store. On the plus side, no membership is needed. It's definetly worth a trip. I will be going for the paper goods."
"5","Came here because dog became sick while driving from LA. Gave great, friendly service. Walked in but did not wait long to be seen. Got examined, medicated, and bloodwork all done within an hour. Reasonably priced too."
"5","Reviewing an animal hospital is a challenge, but so necessary! I've never been a fan of hospitals that have a multitude of vets on staff because of the impersonal atmosphere but several years ago, when my pet was sick, I felt it best to have several vets available to give second opinions. Could not have made a better decision with choosing Sunridge!\n\nWe have gone through it all here and, no matter what doctor we see, we have been happy owners. Our primary vet is Dr. Snead (who reminds me of a sensitive Chris Rock) but we have had several mini-emergencies where Dr. Rosa tended to our care and she is FAB too (reminds me of Chef Lorena Garcia a bit). \n\nAbout 9 months ago, we had a BIG emergency...hesitant that the Animal Emergency Center would charge us thousands I took a chance and called Sunridge at 9pm - the answering service was on the line and 20 minutes later an emergency doctor was unlocking the front doors and provided stiches and xrays - having us to return the next day for payment and follow up, etc. WOW! Unbelievable!\n\nA few flaws is that it is generally crowded with staff frantically swapping computer terminals, no separate entrances for dogs/cats/exotics (yes, they service exotics), and sometimes it takes a minute for your payment to be processed and file to be found. But the care you receive in exchange is worth it!"
"5","I honestly never thought it was possible for a gas station to get 5/5 stars. I really didn't, but this place is great. \n\nThe staff here is super friendly...every time you walk in you're greeted with a \""hello\"" or some other salutation. In addition to everyone just being nice, the store is oddly clean, INCLUDING THE BATHROOM! I have never been into a cleaner gas station bathroom...EVER! I always stop into this gas station on my way home from Henderson to Los Angeles, and I will continue to do so.\n\nIf you are driving down St. Rose and need to fill up, grab a drink, or just \""walk the dog\"", this is definitely the place to stop!"
"3","I have to give it an extra star for not being McDonalds... Panda is average at best. I love their orange chicken, but sometimes it can sit there too long and it becomes in edible. Service at this location is hit or miss and usually the early afternoon is the best time to go... Sucks if you really felt like going for dinner."
"4","3.5 stars\n\nIt's fast asian food so what can I really say that you don't already know?  Their new dining room is very nice, comfortable, and clean.  They have outdoor patio seating, which is cool.  Decent options as far as entrees go and I've never had any surprises in my chicken lol.  I think it can be a little expensive for what it is and the fried rice is a bit bland.  But when I'm looking for something quick but different than the typical burger, this place is a strong option."
"3","We used to go here all the time, but then we found out how much cheaper it was to shop at Walmart.\n\nAll in all the service has been pretty good at this location, but the last few times I have gone in it looks to be a whole new crew... Wonder how that's going?"
"5","I was diagnosed with Celiac Disease (Intolerance to Gluten) in December of 2010 and the first thought that came to mind was \""Oh no, how  can I receive the Holy Eucharist?\"" St. Francis of Assisi has gluten free hosts! I was so happy to hear that, because lets be honest, during cold and flu season we are hesitant to receive the wine. Talk to the sacristan about 10-15 minutes before mass, tell them you need a gluten free host. The thing is, is that you must receive it from the priest because the Eucharistic ministers don't carry it, and you must sit on the right hand side of the church to ensure you get the priest. Nice parish, nice people, and gluten free hosts, are a win -win in my book. :)"
"4","On my previous visit to this Starbuck's, they were experimenting with Dutch seating (a large table). Obviously it did not work. The upshot is that this Starbucks got another makeover. There are now four seating arrangements: 1. square tables, 2. a bar facing the shopping center, 3. cushion chairs arranged in a circle, and 4. an outdoor patio. Regardless that this cafe is over six years old, everything appears new."
"3","Nice location with tough parking and a great patio. Staff is friendly but this location is pretty packed."
"5","Love Love Love. There's not much to be said. If you make my coffee good I will love you forever. end of story.\n\nSuper fast service, clean quiet environment. They never make a mistake. I got free coffee from their drive through TWICE =-) because they said I waited too long. Thank you!!"
"5","We came here for an informal inexpensive meal with another couple. Normally I get the Cuvee salad when I come to Winchells . But tonight they had a Tuesday night special for chicken fajitas for just $11. I couldn't resist. They brought out a huge portion of chicken, stir fried vegetables that are typical for fajita. They also had a very large portion of guacamole, sour cream, beans with melted cheese, and slices chili peppers. The portion was huge. I wasn't able to finish even half despite the fact that I came in hungary. The chicken was moist and very flavorful. The combination, in the tortilla (still warm), was excellent. As good as anything I've had in a Mexican restaurant. All of this for just $11. A great deal. I certainly will come back."
"2","Trying to figure out why they charged me $14 for two pairs of dress pants. They did offer me a 10% off coupon bringing the total down to $12.60. Still not good enough."
"5","Nothing Short of a Miracle!! \nI had a beautiful, very expensive, cashmere sweater that had 3 holes from a moth. Two of the holes were fairly large. I thought it was ruined, I was heart-broken as replacing it was not an option.\nVillage East Cleaners not only repaired it so no one can tell (and I mean not even me) that there was ever a problem but they reassured me it would be alright when I called worried the repair would be unsightly if not weaved properly. \nThese are talented people who know their craft. Do yourself a favor go see them for your most precious alterations/repairs!"
"4","My first time at a Carrabba's and it surprised me in quality and service.\n\n The dough wasn't good for the pizza, and instead of serving sub par stuff to my friend the GM came out and explained what happened and offered any other entree. It was classy and put a restaurant that can get mixed in with other mid-grade italian places that extra star. We came on Wine Wednesday and had the Sangria which was delicious."
"2","My sister and I took my mom out for her birthday.   They changed their menu  not happy about the new menu.   We had asked our server to do something special for her birthday and never did.  The service was not great either."
"2","Service was descent but the crab cakes were burnt! This was my first time here and will most likely be the last. The waitress saw that my crab cake was completely black on the bottom. Obviously they put the lesser burnt side facing up hoping that I wouldn't notice. The rest of the food wasn't much better."
"1","Monday at 9:30 pm is when I walked in with my date.  They close at 10:00pm this night.  Two (2) of Carrabba's employees sees us waiting at the host stand, just stares at us for a monument and walks away as if they contemplated whether to greet us or not.  My date and I wait a little longer while few more employees walk around us without any acknowledgement.  So we decided to seat ourselves.  Another customer that was leaving aided us with the menu.   After sitting, the first employee that recognized us at the host stand ends up being our server/waitress, but that wasn't until much later.   \n\nThis is what I witnessed while i waited for service.  There was an employee moving tables around and vacuuming the floors around the table my date and I were sitting in.  This may be a little extreme, but why not really disgust guest by picking noses and farting next to dining guests?  The others were focused on the side work as well in preparation to close and leave.  Yet during cleaning up the restaurant floor, they small spec of crumbs were vacuumed but the food on the floor a few tables down from us was left alone.  I still don't understand their priorities.   The restaurant was fairly empty the this time with me being the 4th or 5th table to dine.  \n\nI give this place one (1) star only because I cannot go any lower.  I never expected to enter a dining establishment where the employees showed such disappointment because dining guests shows up 30 minutes before closing time.  The term \""going above and beyond\"" is not what this particular Carrabba's is taught, so I can only assume.  That assumption come from speaking with the manager for that night.  I was I got her name, but failed to do so because I just wanted to leave after her condescending responses.  She actually said \""well I can't be out here all the time\"" as an excuse when I explained to her the chain of events they led me to just leave.  Yes, just leave.  Not only was the server rude, she sounded annoyed that she had to explain the menu.   \n\nGoing back to the manager, I have a strong conviction that managers are to manage.  The manager for that shift is to blame for either the lack of proper training or the lack of care the employees show to their guests.  \n\nSo we leave and go to Apple Bees across the street.  The bartender there greeted us as we walked in.  The server sat us strategically so they could continue their side work without interfering with my dinging experience whereas Carrabba's just didn't care.   \n\nAll Carrabba's cannot be this bad.  I'm hoping this does not happen often, not because I care where this business goes but because it would bother me to know this happens regularly to other unsuspecting guests.   I'm sure if I decided to stay and dine at Carrabba's and leave a low or no gratuity, I can only assume they would have cursed me under their breath for being a bad tipper and not being accountable for horrible service."
"1","We went there on Christmas day, we called ahead of time to see if we needed reservations, they said no, unless you want a booth. So we reserved a booth and told them we would be there in half an hour. We arrived and no booth available, she says I see your name here, but its first come first serve, so we waited at the bar, when we were seated we ordered appetizers which were really good, but then didnt get our dinner for over an hour later. People were coming and going and we were still waiting, I complained and was told they had a party in the back room, so they were very busy. When my steak arrived it was burnt and dry, I asked for a container, I figured my dogs would like that. Worse service ever and not the friendliest place."
"4","A fairly non-descript place located in a outdoor shopping area just outisde of Las Vegas but once you are inside, it's quite large and festive. Lots of sushi options as well as cooked options too. Service was very attentive and we had plenty of food.  When it came time for the bill, we were actually surprised at how reasonable the prices were overall.  Would certainly go back when we are in Vegas again."
"5","Very high quality ingredients with great service. The atmosphere is fun if you sit at the bar, intimate if you sit in a booth, or great for families or parties at a table. My husband and I love this place. They will custom make anything, also. \nSake bomb, anyone? :-)"
"5","Super crowded but worth the wait."
"5","The Best place in town hands down. I  bring everyone I know when they come to visit and they always want I love sushi when they come back."
"2","This place has great sushi and I have been coming here for years. Unfortunately today when choosing what to eat, I realized that every price on the menu has been increased by $2. It's unfortunate that they've priced me out of returning because you can get AYCE anywhere else for less than the price of 2 rolls here."
"5","I started tanning at Las Vegas Tan to prepare for my wedding.  The salon is clean & contemporary and has beds that give you great color because they are properly maintained and technologically cutting edge.  I also had a custom spray tan a couple of days before my wedding.  It gave me fantastic color that lasted for a week and did not rub off on my dress.\n\nI would recommend this salon to everyone.\n\nLori"
"4","I always enjoy being able to write a positive review!  This small locally owned tanning facility is clean, modern, and  the owners are friendly. \nGoggles are provided, beds are clean, and coat hooks and chairs are in the rooms!  I have to places that don't have these small but thoughtful items! \n\nIf I had to post anything potentially negative, it would be that they do not have  a stand up bed."
"4","I eat here embarassingly often. I'm talking 5-10x a year or more ! .. I'd like to say I'm drunk everytime I eat here, but like Veronica I eat here sober as well! I haven't gotten food poisoning from Taco Bell and they haven't screwed up my order very many times either. I always do the drive through, but so far so good ! The Beefy Cheesy Burrito for .99 with the rice and sour cream they are serving right now is my kryptonite. Damn you Taco Bell and your cheap crave-worthy eats."
"1","I have been taking my boys to DVP since 2002 and have never had an issue with any Dr's there. As others have said, the staff, not so much.\nNaturally I wanted to bring my new baby daughter here to see Dr. Perez.\nI am sad to see that they now require mandatory binding arbitration in order to do business here.\nWe will not be coming back."
"1","If you like Disneyland and waiting hours to ride rides, you will love this s*!t show of an office. My son has seen Dr Burford, Ky, Greenspon, Blank over the past 4 months Plan on being there all day. They moved to an even smaller location this week which is nicer than their \""prison\"" looking old location. However the prison setting is rather appropriate since their staff looks like a bunch of degenerates on a work release program. Do yourself and child better like I did today and fire these losers."
"1","OK, So I am normally a pretty big fan of Arby's. As far as fast food goes, its near the top of my list, but I will never go to this particular Arby's again. Everytime I go, something gets screwed up, and the last time I went everything about it pissed me off. I got a large drink with so much ice that I could'nt even get a straw into it, and once I managed too, there was about 2 ozs of liquid in a 32 oz cup. I asked for Arby, Horsey, and ketchup at the window, and ended up with 1 pack of Horsey. And I think for an $8 regular combo meal, they can throw a few sauces in. Very disappointed in Pecos and Windmill Arbys right now."
"3","I don't usually review chains, but $8 hot n ready deep dish pizza is seriously good. And only $8!\nDemand was so high on a Thursday night that they kept running out - the stuff coming out of the oven was literally hot and ready!"
"2","I find it strange that people like this place. The food is not good at all. I adore anything chilli cheese..and all of their chilli cheese stuff is pretty gross. I can make better hot dogs at home. I only keep coming back for their ice cream and lemonade float. Yum. But I really dislike the food. I've tried everything on the menu and have to keep coming back here..my favorite food is the jalapeno poppers which are delicious. I just buy a bunch of those."
"5","This place has a female mechanic. We definitely need more women in the automotive industry!\n\nI requested for them to check my clutch too, even though they are not a full service autoshop. Fortunately, my clutch is working fine. I was having problems during the summer and winter, when it's hot the clutch slips too much, and when its cold during the winter it gets VERY grippy. \n\nAnyways, they proved to me that my car is fine. Just some design flaw I guess, since my car has a hydraulic self-adjusting clutch pedal. \n\nDid you know it only took like five minutes of conversing with Adriana (the female mechanic) before they returned my car with the oil, filter, and airbox filter all completely changed?!? \n\nIt may be more expensive than the usual stay at the Toyota Dealership, but appointments at the dealership took me in excess of 2 hours, possibly THREE just to get a oil change. Even though Toyota provides me a 21-point inspection, it basically is the same exact thing with JiffyLube."
"1","I have been to this jiffy lube before and the service here has always been great. However, after my most recent trip here, let's just say things weren't so great.  I parked my car behind the building where the line says 'SMOG LINE' and a manager approached me. He mentioned that the wait time was about an hour and a half. He asked me if I wanted to wait and I said yes. Then he started sweating and looked around nervously and suggested to me another business around the corner with much faster service even after I agreed to wait. I've never been basically told to kick rocks by a manager especially as a paying customer. I'm not too sure what drugs or drinks had been consumed but this was just crazy. I've never felt so embarrassed and stupid leaving a business before. Basically defeating my purpose of getting in the car in the first place. \n\n\nThis WAS my neighborhood car repair service center, but after this experience I will definitely look to yelp in finding a new care center for my vehicle!!"
"1","I'd rather take my chances at UMC Quickcare than to ever come here again. I was basically on my death bed, and they hurried me in and out and I had no idea what I even had. Lol. He gave me a zpak and sent me on my way. Dr. Schlaack was his name and I'm surprised this guy even got a degree. He barely talks. It's funny, while I was in there. He just asked what my symptoms were and only gave me a freaking zpak. Didn't say what I could or could not take with it so I ended up asking the pharmacists at WALGREENS. This place is ridiculous and the staff in general are all whack as fuck... Seriously, if you need urgent care, you're better off magically healing yourself than coming to this dump. Oh and not to mention, I get billed an extra $51.61 for I don't even know why. Although, they do charge an extra $40.00 for a \""Saturday, Sunday, Holiday fee\"" which is NOT placed anywhere in the office nor do they fail to mention that to you. STAY AWAY! THIS PLACE IS GARBAGE!"
"3","This place is small... Service is slow. And there's a particular waitress that really doesn't give a damn and you just know she hates her job. \n\nSushi presentation and flavor differ every time we come here. But the fish tastes fresh. Our favorite is the touch down roll and tiger roll.\n\nWe would be here more often if we were more welcomed."
"5","Sushi Bay has been my favorite nearby Sushi joint for over 5 years now.  The staff is courteous and friendly, I have no complains about the service (and I have been here A LOT)..it has always been consistently on par. When they do get slammed it gets a little backed up, but that is understandable for such a tiny hole in the wall place. The sushi chefs are great and a lot of fun to chat with as well.\n\nOn to the sushi....Paradise roll..it's like a redneck of sushi rolls but it is damn delicious. .. shrimp tempura, cream cheese, avocado with their spicy yum sauce and coconut flakes. My personal favorite is Romeo...it's a less hectic and more spicy take on the Paradise roll. There are so many different choice and variations of sushi on the menu. The fish is relatively fresh and the prices are reasonable, although by no means cheap. Paradise roll is $11.50 I believe, making it the most expensive roll on the menu. The chefs are also accommodating...if you ask them to recreate a roll you like from elsewhere, they will do it.  Being that I am such a fan of Sushi Bay and highly recommend it..I am not sure what took me so long to write a review!"
"4","Not bad, not bad, check it out.\n\nOK!  If you are going for all you can eat sushi, then this probably means  you like the complicated so many flavor and stuff type of sushi. In this case, this place is just fine and you cannot go wrong.\n\n1.  For a lunch place, it is perfect. Just the right size, not too crowded and roomy.\n\n2.  Parking - Easy Strip Mall Parking.\n\n3.  Car Wash - No, just kidding, but hey, you can drop your car off at the Chevron across the street , have it washed and enjoy a good sushi meal.\n\n3.  Pricing - Just right at 21.99 all you can eat.\n\n4.  Quality - No bad!  Now I am more of a traditionalist when it comes to sushi and prefer the basic Nigiri Sushi style with the seafood on top of rice.  However, I can and will enjoy the American invented sushi rolls and here they are tasty and inventive.  the Screaming Orgasm is very tasty and different!  I enjoyed everything that we ordered!\n\n5.  Service - Just right amount of service. Just right amount of help!\n\nSide note, being of asian persuasion, I am quite sensitive to the cleanliness of the bathroom. The ole adage is that if the bathroom in the Chinese restaurant is clean, the food is bad.  Well, here,the bathroom is quite good and the food is good. So, it is a Win-Win!!!\n\nCheck it out."
"2","Food was good, thinly sliced, but good. Unfortunately, my one and only experience here was horrible. We (6 of us) were one of only two tables being served and ordered AYCE. The sushi chef did the normal greeting at most sushi restaurants, but didn't smile once the entire time. Our server did an okay job. Although, she reminded us that they charge or left overs. Are you kidding me? This ain't my first rodeo with AYCE sushi. Anyway, when we ended up being the only table left, the sushi chefs were talking smack about us in Japanese. I've never been more insulted or felt disrespected. Going back to Yama off Flamingo/Maryland and for good reason - It's worth the drive, price, service, and overall experience. If they food wasn't that good here, but the service was decent, I'd even give a better rating."
"5","This is one of my two favorite sushi places in Las Vegas. I have lived here since 2006 and I have been going here from the very beginning. They have all you can eat like every other place (they say they will charge you if you don't finish, but I have never had this happen).\n\nThis is not a place to go if you are not into a laid back environment as it is more of a family/friends place. The servers are great and leave you to your meal but the space is so small it is extremely easy to flag them down when you need something. \n\nMy only complaint and I always tell the manager is that they used to make their cucumber salad with shredded cucumbers but they have since changed to chopping them. It just doesn't taste the same, everything else however I love. I will continue to go here until I move from NV or they close their doors."
"5","I have been a long time goer to this establishment from when I was a child with family pets to now living on my own with my own pets. I currently have an Irish Wolf Hound mix (Dakota) and a Snow Shoe Siamese cat (Rogue). The dog is 10 years old while the cat is 2 years old.\n\nThe receptionists are very friendly and will greet you upon entering and they even have a greeter dog named Cheeto. Dr. Costa has been my primary Vet since obtaining both my animals. She has dealt with Rogue since she was a six week old kitten and Rogue is a very picky cat. She doesn't like most human beings outside of me and does not like being held outside of me either. Dr. Costa has such a genuine touch that she has been able to pick up Rogue and calm her down in order to trim her nails down. I've very happy to have the ability to have a Vet like that.\n\nRecently, our dog Dakota had a tumor coming out of her eye. Not only was Dr. Costa successful in getting rid of the tumor, but she also during time of operation cut off a skin growth, cleaned Dakotas teeth, and removed a bad tooth. She took amazingly good care of my elderly dog and also kept it at an amazing price.\n\nThis staff is this whole hospital is amazing---receptionists, vet techs, and vets alike.\n\nBTW, they also have a Pet-Portal Website which is able track and log your pets information. Legacy is connected to this and will send you emails when its time for shots and vaccinations."
"2","Came here to get new tires, because my tread was getting pretty low on the front two. Ended up selling me all four, and I can't honestly tell you if it was absolutely necessary or not.. But its ok, because now they are all new. About a week later I left town and parked my car at the airport to come back to my rear tire completely flat. Upset because I had just gotten new ones, but they said it was under warranty so I took it back in.  First staff member wasn't the friendliest, and  I waited an hour and a half for them to patch a hole or find what was wrong.  They came out to say they couldn't find anything wrong with it( after putting it in water to see bubbles and everything. etc..) I was pretty upset, but figured, well If it gets flat again I will just bring it back. Literally, 4 days later the exact same tire.. flat. Thankfully I have an air pressure pump at my condo because there is no way I could of even drove to a gas station. I filled it, and as I was putting the cap on the gauge, I see a very thick, and metal something sticking out in the tread. Exactly what had caused the initial flat.  VERY upset, that they ' couldn't find it' I took it back, circled it in the brightest red lipstick I own and barged in. Store manager was there that day and was very nice and apologetic, and they patched the tire successfully. However, I don't think I will go back next time as it makes me a bit weary to know that tire tecs can't find a piece of metal sticking out of the tire. Also felt a bit like they tried to take me the first round since I was a female and was upfront about knowing nothing about car specs."
"1","Went back there because I had a flat tire and was towed in. They wouldn't honor warranty on tires. Said had too many miles. I had spent $2100 on rims and tires there. They tried to pressure me into buying sumitomo tires which are garbage. I drove across the street to discount tires to avoid their bullshit. They are horrible. This happened 1 1/2 years ago."
"1","My family and I had by far the worst tire experience here! We were there for over 5 hours! When we first arrived they told us an hour and a half, then continued to say a few more minutes every time we would ask to see what was taking so long. Long story short, they ended up putting parts on our truck they didn't even talk to us about. The bill came to $1200 and something but we were told $762 when they started the truck. Avoid this place, they scammed a poor little old man before us as well, came in for an oil change and ended up spending 5 hours and over $700 dollars to leave again...poor Charlie. This place is filthy as well, dead bugs, broken lights, dirt EVERYWHERE......Go to Costco or Sams, trust me!"
"1","Do NOT go here. The doctors are good enough but the wait time to get in the room is at least 30 minutes each time. Check in: 10:35, appt time: 10:45, time now 11:27. KMN! \n\nUpdate: they called and said I couldn't be seen there because I had missed 1 appointment in 2009 and 2010 and and 2013. How rude is that? No customer relations at all."
"1","By far the worst car wash I've used. My car ended up worse coming out. I had to go to the gas station next door to wipe down my windshield since there was soap streaks all over it. It looked like my car was rained on and left to dry. Save yourself the time."
"1","I wish I had something positive to say about my hair but I didn't even get a chance to try this place out! I asked the lady at the front if anyone was available for a consultation and after giving me a lackluster \""I'll check\""...she didn't get back to me for 15 minutes! I walked back up to the counter to ask again and it seemed like she had forgotten. Disappeared to the back and came back after another 10 min, didn't acknowledge me at all so I ask again and still not a yes OR no! I wait even longer while she is checking AGAIN. Nothing. I'm standing in front of you!!! I obviously left....if they can't even figure out how to sit me in a chair in front of a stylist then how can I dare trust whatever stylists they may have???? Pretty disappointed to say the least. It would have been an expensive job, too."
"1","I purchased a Groupon for an oil change but after upgrading to Synthetic oil I ended paying $94 in top of the $15.00 for the original oil change. Honesty? I didn't get it at this location. No Savings at all, you will be scam is no way out. You will see it. Also they give a price $239 for rear brakes pad but they did not get me here, I got it done for $89.00."
"1","HORRIBLE! I WAS a customer of this place for several years, until new management took over within the last couple years. Took my truck in for a coolant system issue, and was told I needed a BRAND NEW RADIATOR. After everything, and a \""$100 great customer\"" discount, I was quoted $1,200. I went to the Big O across the street from this terrible Midas, and was quoted $500, and my radiator was JUST FINE. I will never go back to this Midas, as now they're just a bunch of con-men. No wonder their business is so slow now."
"3","It's alright. I had The breakfast egg bacon and potato burrito. HUBBZ had the carne asada wet burrito, he said it was good because he was super hungry.. in man language it means he's had better.\n\nI had the green salsa on the side of my burrito, not spicy enough for me."
"1","Joshua's review was spot on. The first thing recommended to me by the good doctor was an expensive and rather extreme test with no interest in discussing symptoms or any past medical history. He had one foot out the door the whole time. Any input from me was cut off or otherwise dismissed. The whole consultation was terse, bewildering, and illustrated that he sees you not as a patient, but as a walking moneybag. Never again."
"1","Had an extremely unpleasant experience, will not be returning. There are plenty of reviews online on other websites about this doctor expressing the same general feelings. \n\n5 reasons why I wouldn't go back...\n\n1. They spelled my name wrong within the system. After I told the assistant, she notified the receptionist, but sure enough it was still wrong on the paperwork they gave me after the appointment.\n\n2. Came at 11:40am and left at 1pm (Friday) only 4 people were in the waiting area. I could hear the doctor talking to a vendor outside the waiting room they put me in.\n\n3. Saw doctor at 12:50pm and left the building by 1pm. He spent 10 minutes to tell me my lab results were perfect and that I had nothing to worry about.\n\n5. He kept the door open the entire time I was with him, seemed impatient and in a rush. Wanted me in and out, I had to ask him questions as he stood by the door to prevent him from cutting our session short.\n\nI was extremely unsatisfied, doctor did not show any sympathy or interest towards my concerns and was impatient. \n\nIronically my dad had an appointment right after me and his experience was a little different. The doctor was extremely boastful and just bragged about some of his accomplishments to my dad. \n\nI believe he tries to hook in patients that will have a bigger payout for him and spends less time and interest in younger folks. \n\nBe warned, he cares more about your wallet than your health."
"3","Very low key kool area. A salon right across and beanch to sit on in front of the wondow. Overall it is like being in San Diego Ca."
"3","This time I went online to the web sight and scheduled an appointment. I made it for 8:30am and i got called back at 8:35am. Not to bad!!\nThey were very busy. If u did not have an appointment they had an hour wait!!\nMake an appointment for any blood work"
"5","My oldest daughter got her braces off six years ago. My eldest son just got his braces off last year. my youngest son has just finished his phase one and my youngest daughter will start her phase one next year. \nWe have loved every minute of this process and I think my children's teeth are absolutely beautiful!  The office staff is so very kind and treat us like family. I feel blessed that I was referred to dr. Noorda when we moved to Vegas. Dr. Noorda is kind patient and intelligent. I highly recommend them."
"1","This place has improved some but is still pretty bad. The staff was horrible prior to the move from Green Valley to the new location on Horizon Ridge. They have hired a nice receptionist, young brunette, to take over for the bad attitude Asian one, they put her in the back. \n\nI always saw a nurse. It took 2 yrs of going here before I finally saw  Dr. Nancy Long.  The Dr. seemed nice but wasn't helpful stating I needed surgery after seeing me once. I refuse to see the nurse Robin anymore. Robin is mean & unprofessional. Robin opened the exam room door while I was in stir ups to have a conversation & made rude comments to me about my medical history. The other nurse Cindy is caring & helpful.  The same experience pregnant or not. \n\nOh yeah & expect to wait for hours."
"1","I have spent a lot of money at this place and will still do, but I do not enjoy the experience there.\n\n1.  Selection - They do have a great selection of furniture, TV, carpet and electronics. Not so much on appliances.\n\n2.  Sales/Service - The sales team are very aggressive and I have encountered some really goods ones and a lot of arrogant or pushy ones too. I just ignore the pushy ones and come back to buy from another later. Why come back, convenience and selection.\n\n3.  Prices - Not bad, not great. \n\n4.  Store - Very nice set up and lots of great stuff. I have bought my fair share of goods here from the \""display\"", so they are quite effective for sure.\n\n5.  Bad Experience - My personal experience at the store is hit or miss. more misses. I used to come here with my family to browse and see what was available on a Saturday. One Saturday, they were giving out balloons to all the kids. I asked for one for each of my three kids and basically waited 10 minutes and no one could help me, or told me we had to get it at the end of our visit and not the beginning. So, I tried it and after 45 minutes we left and asked for balloons and they said no. I asked why all the other kids had them when they ENTERED the store but we had to wait... No positive answer.\n\n6.  Bad Experience - Went there with the family when they were giving out hot dogs and drinks as a way to drive traffic.  Nothing was available and I was a bit annoyed.  I should have known better.\n\n7.  Bad Experience - I complained to the store in writing about my experiences. NO RESPONSES on two occasions. Just a complaint on how to improve.\n\n8.  Bad Experience - Went to buy a Fridge, huge 65\"" flat screen, Microwaves and a 32\"" flat screen for the office. Was dressed in work boots and kinda dirty. Most of the sales staff ignored me and turned the other way. I had to seek out a sales person, a newbie and bout over 10k from him in 15 minutes.  Why do I feel like I have to do all the work.\n\nBut alas, I am a numbnut because I still go there. Why?  Again, selection and convenience. I go there to get what I need, but I am no longer a loyal customer."
"5","I have nothing bad to say about my RC Willey experience.\n\nMy fiance picked out a new couch in the Henderson store.  We were pleasantly surprised - the salespeople were somehow able to strike the balance between being helpful and letting us browse without pressure.  We chose a beautiful tan leather sofa (which, of course, was backordered).  When it was delivered, I was surprised that the delivery was actually made IN THE TIME FRAME GIVEN!  You know how it goes... they say sometime between 11 and 2, and it ends up being 9 p.m.... well, not this time!  The delivery men worked very hard to get the large couch in our small apartment without destroying anything.  I was surprised that we didn't lose a wall, but they were skilled!\n\nOur couch is in perfect condition.  We even got a follow-up call from the store manager to make sure it was delivered satisfactorily.  All in all, we couldn't be more pleased with RC Willey.  We will be returning when we want more furniture!"
"1","Poor customer service! I saw plenty of associates yet none of them even said hello. In fact I was the one who said hello FIRST to the \""greeter\"" lady at the entrance.  She sat there perched like a parrot the whole time. Why are you sitting there staring at ppl instead of saying, \""Hello and welcome to RC Willey are you familiar with our store?? I can help you or an associate can...\""something like that. Anyway, I decided to mention the bad customer service on the way out, (should've gotten a manager, and told him/her I know) and she gave a \""well some of the employees go home at 5:30pm.\"" I thought yeah and???  The good part was that she apologized for any inconvenience.  Thanks. As far as furniture, you can buy comparable, quality pieces for LESS from other nice stores in Las Vegas. Save your cash amigos...NEXT!"
"2","I really needed carpet and I was impressed with a carpet promotional card that came in the mail for RC Willey. $39 installation and 15-20% off all Stainmaster carpets. I thought I hit a lucky strike. \n\nI called to schedule a measurement of my home. The guy was nice enough and ensured me this twice a year offer was one RC Willey actually looses money on. He explained they try to boost sales even if there is virtually no mark-up. Okay, I thought. Seems somewhat logical...I guess.\n\nSo I go in to RC Willey and meet a sales rep. She has me look at tons of samples and has me pick like 10. After 30 mins of this, I ask if these are the promotional Stainmaster carpets. She assures me everything is on sale. Im suspicious but I play along.\n\nFinally I have her quote me for one sample I liked. Mind you its 3 bedrooms and less than 600 total sq feet. The price: $3300. Like as in $1100 per average size 10x10 bedroom I ask, and she says \""yes' with a straight face. So I ask what is really on a good sale like as described in the flyer? She explains the samples with a black dot is what is on special (like why didn't she say this at first?). So out of 1000's of samples like 12 have the black dot (if you can find them).\n\nOf course the samples on sale are the ugliest. Drab grays and browns and cheap materials. One was dark burgundy with rose pattens, I kid you not. \n\nI am annoyed and ask for a quote for the least of the ugly cheap sample I can find. Price: $1700. Plus I will have to move all my own furniture. I call around to multiple carpet dealers in town (there are tons) and get quotes for hundreds of dollars less, some almost half of these prices.\n\nLong story short, RC Willey uses gimmicks and the old bait and switch to get people in the store. A total waste of everyone's time. \n\nNever again"
"4","Huge store, carries just about anything you can think of. Indoor and outdoor furniture, appliances, flooring, a bit of decor and a good size clearance area. It definitely falls on the 'classic and comfy' style of things. Not modern in the least, there a little bit of crossover contemporary but not a lot. They do have a large number of sectionals in varying styles.  My only complaint is although the service is very friendly I felt like I was claimed by one salesperson and then followed for the entire time I was in there. Completely put me off, I was clear I wasn't buying just looking, but still felt a bit pressured."
"1","Ok so I have purchased items from RC Wiley and have spent a lot of money but will never again. I had a $500 credit limit after I purchased my fridge and when  iwent to use it towards ny bed room purchase it was no longer available due to me paying it off too soon????? (Apparently since I paid $500 in 2months instead of $25 in 10 months) When we attempted to question what they meant and if there was anything that couldbe done the supervisor emele pretty much told us to take a flying leap -are you serious!!  So I spent my $2300 at Ashley furniture. RC Wiley apparently is balling and they don't need me to buy anything. Good luck! when u have poor customer service reps representing you like that their making your company look bad."
"1","Several years back I had a horrible encounter and told myself I would never be back. Well, fast forward and few years and unfortunately the couch we fell in love with was lacated at RC Willey, so here we go again. We finally got it down to a good price and the salesperson asked if we wanted the extended warranty. I asked her what it covered and she responded everything. So, I asked her you mean to tell me if my dog chews a hole in the couch you will fix it for free??? She said absolutely!!! It's covered!!! Well, my dog indeed chewed a small hole in the corner of the sectional and guess what they said when I called.....you guessed it! It's not covered. I should of known better. The have let me down everytime I have purchased from them."
"2","I'm totally disappointed. The sandwich was pretty boring. Although they get kudos for slicing the meat right in front of me. Otherwise, there's just nothing appetizing about their sandwiches."
"3","I love the cherry dipped cones!\n\nStill sad they got rid of the cotton candy blizzard- was my absolute favorite!"
"2","Back in the days of 2006-2007, I used to be a regular at Pumi for the creative sushi chefs and friendly service. Then, as has been well-documented in reviews before mine, the place changed owners/managers/etc and everything went downhill. The fish was not as fresh and prices were higher. After a couple subpar experiences, we cut Pumi from our lives. \n\nWell a few years have passed since we were in this place, so we decided last night to give it another chance. Since I'm with child, I can't eat sushi for a few months (booo). Instead, we sat in back for hibachi where they couldn't even turn the lights on for us! Seriously, we sat and ate in near darkness back there. The hibachi chef was friendly enough, and his rice/veggies/chicken were decent. Shrimp was rubbery, though, and my husband's NY was so thin, they definitely cut them in half. Hey, I have no problem with a place like that as long as it is reflected in the price, but if anything, Pumi has adjusted their prices up. Another negative - that creamy sauce that all hibachi/teppanyaki restaurants give you was really gross at Pumi. I usually eat the whole thing, but theirs tasted like watery mayonnaise.\n\nService was fine.\n\nOverall, Pumi, it's gonna be at least another 2 years before I try you again."
"5","I had an emergency and these good folks were wonderful. They stayed after-hours to treat me. The staff couldn't have been more wonderful and Dr. Scott Manthai gave me great care and follow-up. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
"1","Wow, dude was stoned or something.  I was looking for a bike and asked \""how would X compare to X?\""  Answer: \""It's black, it's legit, too legit to quit.\""  I'm not joking.  So maybe this is the greatest shop in the city but I didn't stick around to find out.  It was a very uncomfortable experience."
"4","I love that Bike Shop is a locally-owned place that really cares about the local biking community. They have a full calendar of group rides, and they host special events like ladies night where they have vendors in with specials and they go over simple maintenance, etc. \nI have gotten excellent advice from them, even when it didn't result in a sale.\nThe service is reasonably priced and the staff is very knowledgeable, but they do have a tendency to get backed up. I recently had to wait an entire week just to get a wheel trued, a process that probably took them about 20 minutes.\nThe shop has a decent selection of apparel and accessories, but they are extremely overpriced. I might go there to look at something, but then I would turn around and buy it on amazon or bikenashbar. Same is true with their bikes - all very expensive."
"2","This review is for the Take Care Clinic more than the store itself.\n\na.  The waiting line - 2 star  - I really like the computerized check in system they have here. You can go on line or check in on their computer. It is totally cool, except that it takes a long time to check in. I am not sure if it saved my data from last time, I had to enter everything again. This thing is nice but very inefficient. \n\nb.  The Nurse Practitioner. 5 star - I thought this person was really good and explained everything. Helpful, caring and efficient.\n\nc.  Services offered - Saves you from having to pay high fees and long wait times at the other urgent care places. I think this is great.\n\nd.  Privacy - Limited. As they start talking to you in the main reception area, everyone waiting in this small modest area can hear you.  They end up taking you inside the room for more details, but the privacy is a bit sketchy in my book.\n\ne.  Charges - We are under 60 but got the shingle vaccine.  Cost is over 200.00 per person. This is standard as insurances will cover you after 60, but before it is on you.  I accept this but the system they have and how you check in does not let you know this in detail.  And, what is worse, the clinics billing is poor. I paid all my fees on Amex and still getting a bill to pay the fees from their central billing department. This bill is poorly done, not too much information and on the back there is no data on what to do if you dispute or anything like terms or conditions. \n\nI will come back again, as it is cheaper than urgent care, but this place is not too inviting as the experience is kind of blah."
"2","I'm only giving them 2 stars because from the outside the shop looks nice. \n\nBut what I don't like about this place is their false advertising. On their door and on their voicemail they said they'd be open on NYE until 1pm. I am here 25 minutes before then and they aren't. \n\nI drove out of my way specifically to come here and they aren't there. These types of careless mistakes can cost you customers and better yet negative review reporting.\n\nThis type of thing shouldn't happen. Although it might be a little mistake it was careless and it just costed them an angry customer."
"1","Ordered from here tonight. I was so excited to have deep dish! I lived in Chicago for 37 years and terribly miss deep dish. So glad Rosati's is out here in Las Vegas. Until tonight. My pizza I had delivered was raw. The supervisor Alison was very rude. Kept saying they're all timed so it can't be raw. She wouldn't let me get a word in. Amateur supervisor no doubt. Her manager wouldn't let her refund it without the pizza. Are you kidding me?! What are they going to do with it? After I paid for delivery, they wanted me to drive it back. Sorry, have your driver come get it. After too much discussion they finally did. I showed the driver and she said \""that's what it's supposed to look like\"". Sorry, I have had many deep dish and none were raw. This is clearly NOT what it's supposed to look like. They wouldn't refund delivery either. Terrible pizza and even worse customer service! I had to give one star or this wouldn't post, but I'd really give them no stars."
"4","Quiet, good friendly service, huge food portions. 2 people can share 1 meal."
"4","If you're not looking for this place, you just might miss it. It's tucked away in a strip mall and worth the hunt. I went with Elite Emily as we explored Henderson more, and we were practically the only people in the spot. The orders were HUGE. It takes a lot for me to wave the white flag, but I had to ask for a box. All the food is fresh and pretty dern tasty. There's really nothing you can go wrong with here, so I'm looking forward to my next trip to try something else!"
"3","These undercooked biscuits were atrocious! Incredibly salty alone and chewing on them was like biting into the Pilsbury doughboy! I'm sure this isn't a common occurrence however, this review is based off of my experience at this location for this visit only. Our server was freakin amazing and he was so nice to every table. I hope IHOP appreciates him and I wish I can say his name in this revue, but it violates yelps terms. Long story short, the restaurant smells like sewer gas occasionally, my blueberry cheesecake waffles were perfect and delicious."
"4","It was Thanksgiving morning and we wanted to meet friends for brunch. Not a lot of choices in places to eat. It seems that only Denny's or IHOP would be available on Thanksgiving . We chose IHOP. To my delightful surprise we got seated right away in a perfect table in the back in the corner where it was quiet and we could talk. I chose a \""fitness\"" item. This was a omelette with egg whites, veggies, and cheese, topped with lots of diced tomatoes. I had a choice of sides. Being at the House of Pancakes, I chose a small stack of three pancakes as my side. I was absolutely delighted with my choices. The omelette was delicious and incredibly filling. In fact I was only able to eat half. The stack of pancakes did not disappoint. They had a choice of syrups. I originally tried the old fashioned syrup. But then I switched to the butter pecan syrup. That was excellent. I really enjoyed my brunch. We were not rushed and were able to sit and chat with all friends for as long as we liked. The price was ridiculously reasonable, especially since we had a coupon. A very nice choice for a Thanksgiving morning."
"4","I booked a block of rooms at The Artisan for my birthday.  I heard it was a cool, swanky place with an awesome vibe to it.  \n\nThe decor and atmosphere is amazing.  You could visit this hotel many times and discover something new each time. \n\nI checked in as soon as I could, which was around 3PM.  I needed a room with two beds, and they wouldn't let me reserve a room with two beds; they said it was first come, first serve!\n\nThe room was very good for the price ($89.)  It was clean and was decorated in a very baroque style.  The room and bathroom were small and my window had a terrible view (the hotel's location is not the best.)  I stayed in the Gauguin room.\n\nThere were a few minor cosmetic details that could have been attended to, but since I was staying less than 24 hours, it just really wasn't important to me.\n\nIt is important to note that this is a hotel with a loud, active nightlife.  Well, it has an loud, active afternoon life, too.\n\nMost of my guests who stayed here were subjected to loud music all afternoon; so loud napping was impossible.  This was not the case on my side of the hotel, which faced the freeway.  At night, it is practically impossible to sleep the music in the nightclub and pool party are so loud.  I didn't turn in until 4am, but the music went on til about 7AM.  It was so loud for my mother, she went down stairs, complained, asked for her money back, and made the 1.5 hour drive home at midnight.\n\nStay here if you are looking for a neat experience, and you are a partier and want to participate in the nightlife.  Don't stay here if you want a good night's sleep."
"1","One of the best and worst Las Vegas Experiences iv had. Now getting a Michael Angelo Suit with a Pool Table for under $500 a night on a Labor day Weekend last minute sounds great right? Well listen to this story. \n\nWe Went to Las Vegas a day early innately staying at the MGM so we needed a room and they were all out we got recommended to this place by someone working at MGM. \n\nNow we get there at first scared to go in because it looked like a MOTEL 8 from the outside. But we gave it a shot anyways. We walked in and it looked really cool at first so were like this is better then we thought. We made friends fast with Jen the girl working up front and soon checked out there rooms. The first room they gave us with there standard room which was small but nicely decorated that had a busted door so for security reasons we asked for a room change. Instead of getting a room change we decided to shell out the extra cash and get the Michael Angelo Suit. Honestly it was tacky and looked and smelled like a place a pimp would bring his hoes for a Orgy. But whatever we decided to make the best of it.\n\nThe girl who gave us the tour to the room mentioned that this hotel is NON-SMOKING but if u get the suit u can do whatever u want u can smoke there just crack open the window. Like a dumby we trusted her and smoked in the room to only find later  they hit ME with a $250 fee. The room was split between me and my cousin but i got hit with the fee. Then when i called them to ask for my money back they said they would give only half and i said fine. And then i saw my bill they didnt take it off i called back later they said oh yeah we were supposed to take it off but there manager reversed it and that if i want to pay half they decided i should have my cousin pay half of it which i was not going to do..There a bunch of let downs. \n\nMy advice is just stay away from this place its shady get a real room at a real place like Palazzo or MGM or Wynn were u can smoke at least and not get hit $250 for a cheep wanna be motel 8 turned into a \""LOCAL CRACK SPOT\"" hotel."
"3","Good service....room was unique...neighbors next door partied til 6am...security n front desk did everything they could! Lounge is always a fun time...want to try Rumors next!!!"
"1","I stayed at this hotel the very first time I went to Vegas, which was in November 2006. It was scary from the moment we walked into the lobby. My friend said it best, \""It looks like the kind of place you see in horror movies. The kind where you go in and never come out.\"" I guarantee if you stay here you'll definitely want to come right back out. The elevators are spooky, and so were both of the rooms we saw. Yes, we saw two rooms because the room they originally sent us to was not ready. As in it looked as if the previous guests had left about 5 minutes prior to our arrival. It was a mess. The room we ended up staying in wasn't a whole lot better. the bathroom was disgusting (there was urine on the floor) the toilet barely worked, and the faucet handle kept coming off whenever you tried to wash your hands. Our room was right on the freeway side, so I guess it's a good view if you like looking out the window at the 15 (not to mention HEARING the 15 freeway). The staff did as little as they possibly could to resolve our issues, and the assistant manager was one of the most arrogant, condescending persons I've come across in life period, not just when it comes to hotel staff. He didnt offer so much as an apology, and was absolutely not subtle about the fact that he didn't want to be bothered with us. Our reservation was for 2 days but we checked out the morning after our 1st night there, we have no intention of going back, and want to warn any others that may consider staying at this hotel.\n\nPros: Nothing\nCons: Everything"
"2","I understand that the Artisan has changed direction and while I can see that the changes they've made have increased their business, it feels like this transformation is spiraling out of control.\n\n Gone are the cozy little areas to sit, unless you want bottle service. They've also removed all the tables around the bar and even the bar stools. The bartender explained to us that since they are known as an after-hours place, they don't want people sitting at the bar, because people can't get up to it to get a drink. I might have agreed with that decision,  were we not literally the only people in the bar.\n\n  On a Saturday night at 11pm there were more employees than customers and more confusion than good times to be had. We already had drinks in our hand and were sent outside to get a stamp; great job, team. The bartender had a terrible attitude...until it was time to tip her. Also, our drinks were served in plastic solo cups; how tacky is that? You charge $15 a drink and you can't afford something a little nicer? We went out the patio, where we were told we had to buy a hookah to sit at a table. A hookah? The patio was also nearly empty, so it just made us feel unwelcome and that there were far too many rules to follow for us to enjoy ourselves. \n\n What I love about this place; the decor. It's a beautiful place, there is no denying that. I like that it's been cleaned up, because it felt like it was circling the drain the last time I stayed in a room there. I also love that there isn't any gaming. That's the end of my list, currently.\n\n We had one drink and left. On the way to the next stop, my girlfriend said \""raise your hand if this cab ride is more fun than the Artisan\""; every hand went up."
"1","Not a place to stay if you wish to sleep. Made reservations months ago for the largest suite in the place and was told after checking in, as a side note, \""We have an after hours club but because you are on the fifth floor you should be fine and not hear it.\"" Wrong!\nFinally had to abandon the room at 3AM and the front desk was not willing to do anything. Didn't even have the earplugs their website boasted. (Should have made the connection then.)\nUpon checkout, the manager worked as hard as he could to be unhelpful and explained that it was not his fault we were unable to use the room for sleep and complaints rarely come from the fifth floor. Really? Do they think I'm lying? \nSo unhelpful and the worst customer service I have ever experienced in Las Vegas. \nHated this place and never going back. I suggest nobody come if you anticipate using your room for sleep."
"2","I hear this place is hopping at around 2am.  I were here around midnight, on a Saturday night and it was dead!  The floors were sticky and the service was lacking.  I may try it again sometime but I'm not racing to go back immediatley."
"3","I have had a Chinese food craving so I have been going for the lunch specials about twice a week.  I decided that I am going to go up and down Spring Mountain to check out all of the Chinese food places.\n\nMy first stop was Cafe Noodle, I didn't hear anything about this place until I walked through the door.  I went in originally to get some good noodles, but their noodle dishes seemed standard for a Chinese restaurant so I decided to do the lunch special.\n\nI ordered the Kung Pao squid, above everything else it was FRESH.  It tasted like they prepared it while I was waiting.  The special comes with some rice, a spring roll and a won ton.  The rice, spring roll and won ton were more then less forgettable.  For 6 bucks though the deal was good and the food filling.  If you eat there I believe you get soup and tea.\n\nI have been there twice since the first time and judging on the quality of food I will be back again."
"4","Great place! \n\nFood was excellent. Some of the best HK style food I've had. Service was great and the food came out fast. \n\nI highly recommend it if you need a break from all the buffets!\n\nI'm definitely coming back on my next trip to vegas!"
"3","Their wait staff is terrible but what do you expect at a chinese restaurant,. \n\nSad to say but the proof is out there..\n\nThe place is not so clean.  Their seats are eh.\n\nFood comes Out quick and that doesn't mean it's pre cooked, Chinese food is just cooked fast.\n\nTheir prices are really good! \n\nThey have a late night five dollar specially I've yet to try but my normal orders are usually:\n\nJelly fish, roast duck, whole deep fried chicken,dumplings, BBQ pork fried rice, and of course their hong kong style pan fried noodles.\n\nI really love their HK noodles. They're my favorite in town over Joyful House.\n\nAfter their stint on dirty dining it's hard to return often.\n\nTheir hot tea is mediocre but again, their staff sucks."
"3","Food: \nfood was good, not great. \n\nPrice: \nmore expensive than other restaurants I've been to. \n\nService: \nThe guy who took my order (take out) seemed too serious and uptight, but the woman who gave me my order was friendly. \n\nOverall, would not come back."
"2","I must say, this is definitely not on my \""favorite, oh my gosh I love this place\"" Chinese joints. I love the price of the stuff here, and I always end up finding myself here to feed a big group of people, or to fix a really really late night craving for Chinese food. \n\nService is generally really fast, but the food is normally on the salty side, like \""oh my gosh I can totally taste the MSG\"" and I normally get a headache after eating here and I think it's from the seasoning, or just the MSG they add to the meals. The place isn't super clean, but it's not disgusting dirty. I do like the taste of their hot tea here that they serve. \n \nFood is nicely portioned, so like I said, I definitely like the price of everything here especially because they have the \""special price/portioned\"" menu. It's easy to feed a party of 10+ more people and end up only paying $10-$15 each if you split the bill'' and you'll have order a shit load of food, like over 6 or 7 dishes. This is a good place to come and eat if you're hungry and you wanna split the bill so you can try everything that's ordered.\n\nThey normally do a good job at accommodating very large groups. Bathroom isn't all that clean, so I would suggest hold it if you can. \n\nOh and parking is a total bitch in the plaza where this restaurant is located so know you have been warned. When the parking lot is full (which it normally is always full) you have to park in the Chinatown parking lot next to this plaza."
"1","I really wanted to give this place stars but when you live in the Bay Area and have access to so many pho spots this place just does not meet the mark.  Especially when they want to charge 8.50 a medium bowl..... The decor has been updated since last yet the service and food is the same.. just pricier.  I have heard that their crab/crayfish night is the fun/tasty however I have yet to experience it.  This review is based on 8 different returns to the restaurant... different times of year, different years.  Yeahhhhhh-- not again."
"3","24 hour pho is unheard of where I am from so this place is amazing just for that!\n\nThe amount of meat in the pho is good, there are plenty of the veggie/herbs. I wish there was just a little more noodle, probably because the broth is so salty I'm 98 percent sure there's MSG in it.\nI don't really have a problem with that, I just need more soda than the one can to get through it.\n\nThis place seems a little hyped just because it's 24 hours but there are better pho spots in town by far."
"3","Haven't always been a big fan of pho but this place gets the job done after a weekend of heavy intoxication. Soup, in general, cures a lot for me! The regular bowl was a good size. It had just enough noodles and soup. Though it would've been better if they added more brisket and steak. Gotta love that extra meat! Waiters seemed funny here probably because I couldn't fully understand their jokes but I guess it made up for the o-k service. The extra star really belonged to the desserts I tried on my recent visit. There were these ice cream balls called exotic bomba and bomba. (Filipinos, don't get any dirty ideas!) Both were actually pretty good. The exotic bomba had a fruitier taste coated with white chocolate and the bomba had a coffee taste coated with milk chocolate. Once again, I was suckered into the sweets!"
"4","Love this place. Just took down the shrimp rolls and some pho, always good no matter what time."
"1","First, Saigon 8 is much better. The bathroom smells like a petting zoo at Kim Long, and there were roaches on the floor. The parking is crowded and it smells like an armpit. Trust me, I've been to many pho places in garden grove and Westminster and this place is schwag. \n\nAlso, you'll like what happened there: \n\nThere is a nice looking girl at the front (employee) that drives an expensive benz, and my buddy quietly said \""oh, that's a nice looking girl\"". Nobody at my table cared and our conversation moved on to gambling talk. Then, the bus boy strolled up to our table and instead of asking if everything was alright, rudely said \""how do you know my fiance, and why are you talking about her\"". I almost started laughing because a thought it was a joke, but the guy was mad. \n\nI walked up to the manager and expressed my concern, then I asked the girl why her fiance was bugging us. She said she is not engaged, and definitely not to the bus boy, lol. Then mysteriously the bus boy became silent and disappeared. The kitchen cleared out like there was going to be a fight, in fact the waiter called them up front like an old kung fu movie. It was disrespectful to all the customers, my table, the girl, and embarrassing to mgmt and the bus boy. \n\nWhat a weird place, I also think he might have thought we were talking about the girl because my fiend's name is genny and maybe that was her name, but what a bunch of foolishness. \n\nEither way, if you are not trying out for a kung fu movie where you have to fight the whole staff, I suggest going elsewhere. This is not the best pho, and they are not the best listeners. They are quick to judge. It smells and has bugs. \n\nI will be sure to only stop here if I have to take a dump."
"3","Friends from So Cal were visiting and wanted to come here.  One of them is a FOB Vietnamese (she calls herself that!) and has dined here before.  Her boyfriend also loves the place and so do I, so we had lunch yesterday.\n\nI had the Beef Fried Rice, she had I the Sweet & Sour Pork Chops, and I don't know what her boyfriend had, but it looked good.  All of the dishes were excellent.  We didn't leave hungry, that's for sure!\n\nThe only strike against this place is that the servers here seem so unfriendly.  They don't say hello, have a mean look on their face all the time, and when my friend asked for chopsticks, the server gave her a mean look and pointed to the chopsticks on the table....she obviously didn't see it, but it was the way he handled it that was shocking.  The funny part is that she's Vietnamese, so you would think they would treat Gringo's like that, but not their own....whatever.  They only get 3 Stars because of the service.\n\nWill I return?  Pho-gettah 'bout it, of course!"
"4","I prefer the pho at Pho Kim Long over any other pho restaurant in Las Vegas. Very inexpensive and delish! I don't feel overly full and stuffed. I feel healthy leaving. I've never ordered anything but pho #10. Soooo good!!"
"3","It is and will always be that late night restaurant that is super fast, semi lively, and satisfying. This place has totally surpassed its name by remotely being called \""F**cking Long\"" by many. It utterly appears to me as having one of the quickest service.. almost as fast as McDonalds.\n\nSince I first came to this place, the quality of the restaurant itself had changed dramatically.. only for the good though! Since the management changed a couple of times, the cleanliness of the environment had skyrocketed. There used to be an open area seafood, like the tanks you would see at 99 Ranch or any other Asian market, which was cool and all, but they got rid of it and added an extra table. The drinking water (thank god) was also one of the many things that they had switched around! Oh yea, I think they charge on soda refills, so beware!\n\nOf course, for food, you would most likely end up ordering the Pho whether it would be the soup or rice noodles, for example, the common  Pho Dac Biet (combination noodles). Sadly, they're kind of mean with the meatballs :( I would only see one floating around. On the other hand, also try the charbroiled pork chop, that one is pretty bomb as well. \n\nGirls, if you're looking for some Viet men or some late night attention, they would gladly tend to your needs and ignore majority of the customers. Don't forget, if there are other groups of girls who come in who, lets say, came back from clubbing, you would immediately become one of the rejectees and may have some difficulty getting employee attention. Real shit, they kind of flirt way too much. I know it's common elsewhere but sometimes.. I just want to eat my food and be treated equally! :\\"
"3","Searched for 24HR pho restaurants that were open and this was amongst the list. You probably already know why my friends and I chose this place.\n\nAnyway, it took forever to get our food. Not the usual in less than 5MIN. so it was kinda strange having to wait for pho.\n\nI got the rare steak pho and it was just... okay. The broth wasn't that great but I was craving pho so it \""I guess\"" it satisfied my cravings.\n\n3 stars because this place is open 24HRS!"
"4","Open 24/7!\n\nHonestly, I don't remember what I had but it was good! \n\nAll I know is, if I were hungover, I will hands down convince all my other hungover friends to go here and have some good, homemade Vietnamese food!"
"2","Rip off. \nThey think they are a 5 star restaraunt. 15% tips was automatically added to the bill. Water was not refilled until I waived down the waiter, waiter did not check to see what we neeeded, we had to pay at register. \nFood B, Service C, Atmosphere B, Price C."
"4","After hearing several people Rave about Pho Kim Long, I decided to check it out; and I can say I was not disappointed.\n\nThe place is fairly big and we were seated immediatley (there can be a wait but they burn and turn pretty fast). The staff was attentive and we had several people swing by the table to make sure we were doing OK.\n\nThe menu is impressive, I was just expecting your average Pho place, but they menu covers much more, apps, Pho, entrees, smoothies, and much much more.\n\nI decided on the #11 Rare Steak and Brisket Pho. I also got an order of the Chinese Doughnuts to start.\n\nMy only complaint is that the doughnuts were plain, when I usually order them they're covered in sugar, but a little quick thinking and I was using the remaining Peanut Sauce from my companion's spring rolls for a great dish.\n\nThe Food came out insanely fast, the apps were good, but the Pho stole the show. The Steak and Brisket were both tender and delicious. The noodles were plentiful, and the broth was rich.\n\nI will be going back without a doubt!"
"4","I wonder how they come up with these names...\n\nNonetheless, the pho was great. The wait to get a table was short and the food came pretty quickly. There were a lot of things on the menu, including some Chinese cuisine. The prices are pretty low too. However, I just wanted some simple pho. I don't really know how you could get pho wrong and I hope to never experience that, but this place did the trick.\n\nAlso, it's open 24 hours."
"1","pho is good when your hungover.. so i will eat it where ever but there was this one time the busboy was cleaning up dishes and he brought out this bucket of dirty dishes which smelled like complete ass! completely lost my appetite right there but it came back when the food finally came out. they didnt have any sauce trays stocked at our table and my buddy's food came out a decade after i finished my food.. pretty bad restaurant but you cant complain as it is probably the best las vegans can find"
"5","This place gets brownie points in my book for being open during the wee hours of the night. This place would normally be an average 3-4 star rating but it gets 5 stars due to the fact that its open 24 hours, it's located off Spring Mountain and Valley View (relatively close to the strip, making it convenient for late night eats for locals getting off work or after a night of clubbing or gambling). \n\nWhat I also like about this place is that no matter how busy it is, service here is FAST! After sitting down and ordering, I'm pretty sure we almost always get our orders (even with parties of 4+) within 15-20min or less!\n\nI always start off with ordering their calamari which I find very tasty. Then I enjoy ordering the Mongolian beef or the Bun bo hue; a vermicelli noodle soupy have good pho according to my Vietnamese friends who always order that but I usually don't get it because I'm not in the mood for soup and the bun is basically the same ingredients without the broth."
"2","Wow, things change really quickly over in Chinatown. \n\n1st time I came here, I had such a good time that I gave this place a 5-star review. After my last 2 visits..Now, I gotta give it only 2 stars. \n\nThe staff was rude this time around. Very anti-social and easily irritated. \nThe staff was constantly making fun of customers behind their backs. Calling them all types of degrading names and making fun of their hair, clothes, etc. I found their behavior to be very out-of-line. \n\nFood was still really good. So they get 1 more star. \n\nI don't understand why this place attracts such a shady crowd?  People all around me were loudly talking about sexual topics, drugs, and screaming profanity in the air.   I really don't mind that atmosphere because I use a lot of profanity myself, but this place is designed like one of those fancy 5-star restaurants, so I would expect a more upscale crowd.  Infact, I enjoy that kind of atmosphere when I am at a  dive-place like \""Ellis Island\"" or downtown, but \""Pho Kim Long\"" is a fine-dining establishment with it's giant neon fish tanks, marble tables, and chandeliers. I know I am in my 20s, but I have a lot of friends who are 60+, and one of my friends is actually a former civil rights activist from the 1960s. I felt really  bad having a man of his integrity have to sit there and listen to drunks and typical vegas-trash talk so much sh!t around him.  \n\nThis sucks because now I gotta find another 24 hour Pho place. If anyone has any suggestions please let me know."
"3","I just come here for late night meals after work. Everyone from Vegas knows Pho Kim Long. This is why it tends to be the meet-up point for most locals. Always busy, but the food is eh. Nothing special at all. Seriously. Just an average pho place. Weird thing is that they fill their waters ahead of time in case they get busy. If I did that at my restaurant, I would get chewed out. I don't think it's against health regulations or anything, but it's just odd. Cheap, well-known, open late = keywords."
"3","Pho Kim long took a pho Kim long time to bring us our food.  Food was very ok.  Nothing to write home to mom about...\nWould come here again because of the name...."
"4","So here I am, FINALLY writing a review.  I've been here many times and yet, have not taken the time to state why.\n\nI started coming here less than a year ago with my sister and her bf with the recommendation of one of his friends.  Well, I haven't had pho in many years, it was cold, so sure, why not?!\n\nIt was very tasty.  I tend to get the same things with each visit. Egg rolls, chicken wings, and small #15.  All very satisfying and hits the spot each time a craving sneaks up on me.  I do have to say, I now find myself craving the wings (with TONS of fried garlic on top) more then the pho. My mouth is starting water just thinking about those crispy, juicy little things.\n\nThe baby decided she doesn't like the noodles, so I always get a bowl with a little bit of rice and add the soup for her.  She also, recently, decided she likes the egg rolls too.  \n\nI haven't really tried any place else for pho, but I know I should, to see if I really do like it as much as I do.  But for now, this is where I'll be."
"4","It's your last day in Vegas, you lost all your money...on whatever you did...you don't even remember.\nYou're hung over as a mofo.  \nYour breath be all stank like a dead possum.\nYour head feels like it's being squeezed by a hariy giant.\n\nYou get your hot bowl of pho with extra meat for 1 dolla and you feel a little better.\n\nThen you get in your car and drive the 5 hours it's gonna take to get back to LA where you will work your ass off to save enough money to do it all again.\n\nOh 3 servers will come to your table and ask if you are ready to order within 2 minutes of you sitting down.\n\nAnd it all happens 24/7.\n\nOh and it tastes pretty good too."
"3","24 hour pho place.  Check.  Besides that, I really can't say that much about Pho Kim Long.  The decor is nice and there is a cool fish tank that definitely brings this pho joint up a notch, but the pho itself is slightly over priced and not that amazing.  Maybe I am spoiled having lived so close to Westminster for so long.  I am not saying that this is bad pho at all, I just was not impressed.  \n\nThe second thing that bothered me was that it took forever to be served and to get our food.  Usually pho only takes a few minutes to get everything in the bowl and then it is in your belly in no time.  I felt like this was the longest pho meal ever.\n\nI probably won't be back anytime soon, unless I really really want pho and I can't find any other pho place to go to.  I expected more Pho Kim Long.  You let me down."
"4","Great hangover Pho if you ask me!"
"1","I am currently sitting in the middle of the dining room feeling as if no care is given by management.Horrible and disrespectful service.  food came out very fast but was extremely cold as if it was cooked an hour ago. Actually it was a fried egg roll and it was cold inside and out so of course it has been sitting for a long time. When we asked for the food to be hot, the waiter said, \""it is hot\"". such bad service and I am even taking in consideration that it is an Asian restaurant where service is not the number 1 concern or priority. I am sitting in my seat right now waiting for a manager, getting looks from my waitress as if I am lying about cold food. Unbelievable."
"5","A bit of a wait, but that's expected for a popular joint. Best pho ever!  Kind and fast service with great food! Open 24 hrs and near the strip. \nEven if you are not into pho, they have great selection of different varieties. Liked this place so much ate here twice during the same Vegas trip."
"2","Pho wasnt all that great, but a great way to cure a hangover...\nbroth wasnt good and the waiters and waitresses forgot alotta things that we ordered."
"4","My inner Vietnamese Pho snob wants to give this place 3 stars. My hungry Vegas cheap college student wants to give this place 4. So let's settle for 3.5.\n\nParking: nice little private lot right in front. Yay I love vegas, you never have trouble looking for parking like in LA.\nService: very attentive. They have a freaking army of servers even at 1AM. I was very mindblown. They came by to refill water once or twice, gave us an excess of lemons when we asked for more lol . \nFood: definitely the best.pho.ever. A very big bowl contains not that much noodles and beef. But I very much enjoyed the warm comfort food at 1AM in the cold dessert weather after clubbing. MMM MMM MMM. Prices are a little jacked up.... but we have to deal because there aren't that many pho places close to the Strip that are open late-nights. Very FRESH and clean bean sprouts. I was very impressed! All the legit leaves were there too!\n\nWe paid and were about to leave. DUN DUN. Ice and Coco for E's Ice Loves Coco came in. THEY EAT PHO?!?! Mindblown part 2. Just for that, I gave Kim Long the extra half a star for their coolness! Will be back the next time I'm hungry for some cheap eats late at night in Sin City :)"
"4","My go to place for Salted Fish and Chicken Fried Rice!\nAdd in a side order of their crunchy good spring rolls and I'm set. Fast, almost always friendly service, and I've always wondered how that night manager, at least he looks like the manager, is able to stay that skinny when he is surrounded by all this food..."
"3","This place is cool, not only cause the name, but the hours. The food's pretty good, ordered pho and you can get extra broth for just $1. The service is alright, like any other mom and pop asian place. We had a problem with our check and the man was being very rude about it. I'm sure there are numerous large parties that come through the restaurant and want to split checks or pay partial cash, partial card. The man was just being very impatient and fussy and the funny part is they weren't even busy at the time, he was probably just having a bad day. The prices are reasonable too and the food is good. But this is the place to be after a long night of partying or to cure your hangover in the morning!"
"4","Food quality: 4/5\nThe pho here is awesome! I loved my pho tai chin with some bo vien. It wasn't too hot and the noodles didn't stick together. The one thing I wasn't impressed with was the spring rolls which are something my girlfriend and I almost always get with our pho, hence the 4/5.\n\nCustomer service: 5/5\nIt's good for any sort of asian food place. The people were courteous, kept my water filled without me asking, and delivered the bill promptly/returned the receipts.\n\nAmbiance: 4/5\nThe place is in the heart of asian town on Spring Mountain Rd. It's nice inside and smells strongly of pho (which is why you're going here, right??). The one thing I disliked was the fish tank looked quite unkempt while I was there, but that could have been something they were in the process of cleaning or something... Still, minus one star."
"1","I typically rate places based on food and food alone. However this is an exception and will explain why.\n\nMy husband and his friends stopped here (at my recommendation and others) for lunch and enjoyed delishly prepared and priced food. The group walked out the door when my husband realized he left his phone on the table.\n\nHe turned back around (maybe 1 minutes time passed) went to the table where it was being cleaned and asked the waiter did someone see my phone it was right there. To which the guy replied \""no\"" and kept \""working\""\n\nAnnoyed and confused the group returned to the hotel by cab. I decided to whip out my phone and locate his.\n\nLow and behold we look at the iphone locator only to find that the iphone (30 min later) was in a car in the employee parking lot behind the restuarant. We were mid-tanning so we figured we'd head over there in the next hour. An hour later it was still thre so they try and hail a cab and locate the phone only to see it moving- in the car that the EMPLOYEE---\n\n\n\nEat at your own risk- keep your phones hidden these employees have no common courtesy."
"1","Pho Kim Long....more like Pho Kim Wrong.\n\nHORRIBLE, RUDE, UNPROFESSIONAL, DISRESPECTFUL \""MANAGER\"" \n\nI was just at this establishment (at approx. 2:30am) and it was just appalling. I have been here a couple times before and I wasn't expecting such horrible \""management\"" skills from their \""manager\"". The service staff wasn't so bad. Throughout the meal our cups were filled and they made sure everything was up to par. Everything was running smoothly up until the bill arrived. I was in a party of 4 and we needed a split check. We went up to the register to pay and it took a while for anyone on staff to assist us. Once we ask for a split check one server gave us a dumbfounded look and walked away from the register. Then another man went to the register and flat out said \""We don't do split checks.\"" \n\n*Sidenote*\nI have been here before around the same time and they were able to do a split check without any hassle. \n\nI told the guy that they were able to fulfill the request last time but he said, \""Thats impossible, not without my approval\"". He was very rude and when I was explaining this to him he was practically ignoring me and a my group while he was counting money from another party. Flat out ridiculous. He also charged my friend our whole check before we were told we couldn't split it and faked a void. \n\nNO MATTER HOW DESPERATE YOU ARE FOR FOOD ON THE STRIP LATE AT NIGHT YOU'RE SERIOUSLY BETTER OFF AT SOME GREASY DRIVE THRU THAN PHO KIM LONG."
"1","Worst experience ever. DO NOT EAT HERE.The only reason I'm giving one star is because the potstickers were amazing. But that is the only good thing about this restaurant. The service we horrible. The waiters throw things on the table and don't  check back and the check was never brought. The cashier was highly disrespectful and rude. Do not eat here. There are other Vietnamese restaurants in town. Find a more friendly location."
"2","Boyfriend and I wasn't impressed \nPho was decent \nBut the bun bo hue was very bland. I also had ask for a hot tea Togo and the guy said they don't do Togo hot teas? How interesting"
"1","Smelled like they wiped all their tables with dirty smelly rags... I can't eat in these conditions."
"3","I mean what can you say about this place that hasn't already been said 1000 times. \n\nFood is always spot on but service is awful!\nWe use to have decent service but past 2 times mine or my fianc\u00e9s food has come out wrong. The servers rarely pay attention to you when you are speaking which is why it comes out wrong."
"2","I love Pho. I love it a lot actually. It's my go to food any time I am feeling subpar. \n\nWhen I was released from the hospital and craving comfort and a quick start to my system I came her. It was 2 AM on a Wednesday and they were kind of busy. My friend and I were immediately sat and 2 seconds later water was being dropped off and a little lady came over to our table and took our order, I stated I needed a few minutes.\n\nWe ordered spring rolls and two differnt kinds of pho, beef and vegan.\n\nThe food came out quickly. The spring rolls seemed as if they had been sitting around because they were all different colors and some of the innards of the roll were mushy. The peanut sauce was also a little off.\n\nOur pho came out a few minutes later. (The food came out so quickly) My pho was okay, but not great. Definitely disappointed. \n\nAlthough it satiated my Pho-fix. It wasn't that good. I wasn't impressed. I don't get what the hype is about... I personally think it's the tongue-in-cheek, punny name sake.\n\nPho Long, I will not be back. I can make my own punnies too."
"3","losing a star.  Since they've gone to 24/7 hours, the prices have gone up and the quality has gone down.  They turn so many tables I don't think they care about service anymore.  Still the best spot for viet food in LV but viet food shouldn't be too expensive, it's comfort food from a 3rd world country!"
"3","Good lunch spot, although it took some time to get our servers attention. We both ordered Pho and it was delicious. Mine (with various meats) and his (chicken) came out very quickly and had nice flavor. We were seated at a giant round table even though it was just the two of us and our 1 year old. They child seemed to have thrown them off, but overall the experience was good."
"4","Pho isn't alwasy Pho.  You can end up with some terrible broths.  This place is always consistant and super busy.  I like that sometimes I have to wait in line.  It reminds me that I'm not the only one who likes this place for lunch"
"1","Ugh!!! I used to come here every Saturday after Japanese school with my mom. \nI have FOND memories here, but something has happened. Something terrible...... \n\n - The servers don't speak English nor do they speak any other Asian language. \n - I ordered tea and got a green tea bag in my mug... A MUG!! ... GREEN TEA!! \n - The small dish for dipping is a deep black little cup (customary for ketchup or ranch) \n\n\nIf you know Pho.. AUTHENTIC PHO you know those three points are enough for a strike. \n\nThe taste has declined and I was SO incredibly disappointed. \n\nHighly Americanized and the awful parking lot really doesn't make this place worth your time or calories."
"3","Came in late last night for dinner and saw a short line of people. Fortunately, service was swift enough and both me and my bf got seated almost immediately. \n\nThis place is busy! Noticed that patrons tend to be either party-goers or families. Food is ok, not fantastic. I got the rice noodle with barbecued pork and egg rolls while my bf got his usual chicken pho. Didn't think too highly of the food, but when you are starving, it actually left me pretty satisfied. I can see myself coming here before going out for a party or after a clubbing night. \n\nOne of those places to go to if you are looking for comfort food."
"2","If you want to wait 30 mins just to place your order, come to this place. Food is great but the service is lacking."
"1","Worst customer service in existence!   It's kinda funny to see this in this day and age.   But,  if of don't mind the attitude the food is good."
"1","i was the first time came to Las Vegas,I was so hugely when I arrived this resturant,I feel bad when I arrived,bad service,late food and bad food,I don't want to came again."
"4","Place is very busy but well worth the wait. People in town say it's the best pho place to eat. My food has been amazing both times I have been there this week. Our server didn't listen to my order and when I told her it was wrong but I ate it she didn't care lol. I will still go back because it's that good."
"2","My friends and I came to Pho Kim Long to eat dinner around 8PM. Upon first impressions, I liked the decor of the restaurant. It was nicely decorated and roomy. We were also seated immediately. We all sat down, thought about what we wanted to order... 10 minutes had gone by after we were seated and no one came up to us to ask us what we wanted to drink. A couple of minutes later, an older gentleman took our orders. My friend and I both ordered Pho Dat Biet (special combination tender beef noodle soup, $8.75), my boyfriend ordered half of the Ga Chien Gion (deep fried chicken with fried garlic, $13.95 for half chicken), and my other friend ordered Com Chien Tom (shrimp fried rice, $11.50). \n\nHere came the most disappointing part. I'm not exaggerating when I say that 30 minutes had literally gone by before the first dish came out, and that was my boyfriend's deep fried chicken dish. I thought that this dish was pretty good. It wasn't too salty and I loved the fried garlic. Do note that this dish didn't come with rice so you would need to order it on the side. At this point, I'm starting to look around the room hoping to catch the attention of the workers to see if they had brought out our dishes. 5 minutes after the fried chicken came out, both of the Pho Dat Biet came out. Honestly, I didn't think that it was too good. The broth wasn't anything spectacular and for the \""special\"" bowl of Pho that we ordered, there was barely any beef, tripe, tendon, and all the other components that goes in the special. \n\nAt this point, my other friend who had ordered such a simple dish of fried rice STILL has not received has order. We started trying to track down the employees and finally managed to spoke to one about how we haven't received the last dish of fried rice. There was a couple who was sitting nearby us, who were seated way after we were seated and had managed to receive their food order BEFORE we even got ours! And how is it that the fried rice would be the last dish to come out? Makes no sense to me.... So about 10 minutes after both of the Pho dishes came out, my friend's fried rice finally came out. It didn't look too appealing either... He also mentioned that some of the parts in his fried rice were cold and not warm at all...\n\nI don't know what happened with our order honestly. Pho Kim Long is open 24 hours, which is great for people who want to grab a late meal after EDC, clubbing, etc ;]. Since Vegas is the city that never sleeps, I'm sure many people there appreciate how late Pho Kim Long is opened. It's possible that at night, they don't have as many cooks in the kitchen or they simply forgot our order... who knows! I most likely wouldn't visit Pho Kim Long to eat again unless I desperately needed some soup or Pho late at night!"
"3","Came here to satisfy my late night hunger. Open 24/7! This place is ok. Nothing close to amazing but satisfying enough for me. They don't have tripe & their boba is nasty & old. Full of loud drunk people & couples who are arguing for everyone to hear. I guarantee you will get a free show to go with every meal, entertaining & full of drama if you come after 12!"
"4","When I'm not eating pho, my other options are chicken pad Thai which theirs are good and Hong Kong style chow mein (crispy noodles). Every dish I have tried has been satisfying, can't complain. This spot is great for after drinking with friend, just lately the wait has been approximately 20 minutes. Vegas heat sucks!!!"
"3","The 24/7 pho spot. I've been here a few times. One time at 7 in the morning they were bumping EDM. Not cool when you're hungover. Other than that, the food is decent."
"1","Service is horrible !  Simple as that \nI felt like regulars and member of the same race was being favored I waited 15 mins for the table which doesn't bother me at all ! If your busy that's fine \nI sat down and waited for 10 mins no water or anything was brought to me ... 20 mins passed I flagged down a busser and informed him I was ready to order can he notify my sever 30 mins passed \nAnd nothing I told my wife to just wait a lil longer and nothin \nAfter 35 mins they can we ordered and I waited for my 23 mins for my food it arrived I ate and had to wait another 24 mins for my check ..."
"3","Food is getting worse and worse every time I came. I get very disappointed even though this is nice place. :(("
"5","I love this place.. great friendly, professional and effective service... I came here years ago after my car accident. Now I come with my girl 2 x a week.. Chong is my favorite doc.. They always have plenty of candy... And they are keeping the SHASHI in there somewhere..."
"5","We went here today to get a new windshield for my Nissan Xterra (fix it ticket ick). And honestly I was not looking forward to the pain my pocketbook was going to be feeling from this one (once we asked ourselves if paying the ticket would be cheaper than the windshield- HA) But honestly, United had the best price quote of anyone in the city and that's why I chose them. The side benefit from selecting them was that there was no wait for us this morning (we got in at almost 9am) and they were super friendly and all around excellent to deal with."
"5","Jeep wrangler Rubicon 7 Windows and strip on the front. Limo tint on the back 5, MN 35 on the driver and passenger. Total was $160 super nice accommodating folks and the tint looks amazing!"
"5","THE most legit glass shop in town. They've worked on two of my cars on a few separate occasions & have done nothing but an awesome job. While some glass shops leave you with wind noise, crooked glass, purple tint, or just a messy job in general, United Auto Glass very professionally installed original Lexus glass."
"2","The concept is great. Cheap groceries. A good selection of produce. Slam dunk right? Sadly, for me, it isn't.\n\nThis location is small (I havent been to others) and with everyone pushing around shopping carts, there is no room to walk around and grab the produce or items I need.\n\nThe prices are great, but the quality of the produce isn't the best. It's always hit or miss. A good example...Each morning, I squeeze myself a glass of orange juice from the market. Mariana's tends to be a tad cheaper than the ones at Food 4 Less, but the Mariana's oranges look like they are the red-headed step child of beautiful navel oranges. Bumpy, and they look abnormally large. I don't want steroids in my fruit or my baseball players. I don't even know if you can roid up fruit, but these oranges do NOT look natural.\n\nI'll pay a buck more for piece of mind. Oh yeah, and Food 4 Less is across the street."
"3","Went there on Friday for menudo but it tasted horrible.  It usually tastes good on the weekend, so not sure if I got an old batch or what.   I am going to try again on the weekend and hopefully it will taste better."
"3","So I went back to this place to try something off the rest of the menu.  My husband and I both ordered the pho with well done beef.  While I was impressed with the freshness of the sprouts, the soup left a bit to be desired.  The beef was really fatty and the noodles were really over cooked.  I know asian places are not known for their customer service but when I ordered a drink with a number instead of the name, the waitress about crapped herself.  She yelled in shock as if I was trying to order two entrees.  At least the gentlemen who work there were friendly."
"3","if you don't feel like eating the pho at treasure island and you are in need of a massive hangover cure, i would definitely venture out here to have some authentic pho.\n\nthe pho at pho vietnam wasn't the best i ever had and the cha gio (eggrolls) were oddly pale even though they were fried.  the iced coffee came already prepared rather than from a slow drip.  this is a good place to come if you have a large party and you don't want a wait.  it's also in the same plaza as ranch 99."
"5","Service guy came right out that same morning I called in. He was friendly and knowledgable. Had my TV repaired that same day. The other TV repair company had installed an incorrect lamp. Now my TV looks great."
"5","One of the best Mani-Pedi's I've ever had. Very clean and professional."
"4","I enjoyed the foot massage and they did great job on my nails"
"5","Best nail place! I been coming here for over 10 years now! It feels like home!! Great job'! Moderate price! I come and it relaxes me! Their pedi and massage chairs are the best! I truly recommend it! They are very nice! And the work is amazing! I trust them! You won't regret it!"
"5","I do get my nails done here and there.. when I feel like it. However, this is the ONLY place i have been where the have the newest up to date acrylics: shimmer-sparkles- AND colors OH MY! to choose from. I recently moved and still keep in contact to say hello with my girl. SHE MADE MY NAILS LOOK LIKE SHINY JEWELS!!!  The Price is fair for the precise and neat work that is done. Around $35/40 (new) depending. I usually would get a shimmer acrylic on the tips then would fill later. No second thoughts.. if you walk in its worth the wait. :) I have recommended MANY friends here. Nails would never pop off, i would ask to soak or drill down to take off."
"4","I hate getting my nails done in this city until now!! Not the cleanest place I've ever been too but here's the T. Walked in the am and and got an appointment immediately! Mani and pedi gel we are off to a good start. They didn't have both colors that I wanted but it's no shade. Pedi and mani were quick and she got the job done! I hate waiting for hours to get my nails done. I'm a busy lady and I need to get in and out! So if you're looking for a great place that gets the job done book your appointment now! Again it's not the classiest place but they do great nails for Vegas"
"3","I don't like this store as it's woefully understaffed but I did just have a wonderful customer service experience for a little brown boy named Josh. That's enough for me to start thinking about coming here again not just out of necessity.\n\nRest assured, this would be 1-star if it wasn't for the great service experience."
"1","TRES VECES, la orden me ha salido mal!  No recomiendo este lugar para comida salvadorena.\n\nTrate darle otra oportunidad pero despues de haber recivido la comida mal en tres diferentes ocasiones, ya no mas!\n\nEl pollo, el pescado simple y reseco!  Y cuando se le comunica el problema no se hacen responsables.  Muy mal servicio!\n\nBusquen otro restaurante salvadoreno!!! No pierda su tiempo ni su dinero."
"2","This Starbucks is pretty disorganized.  Every time I've been in this place I wait much much longer in line than I would've if I would've gone through the drive thru.  So frustrating.  This Starbucks needs some management and better cleaners."
"1","The last Macaroni Grill that I ate at was back in 2008 with my boyfriend (now husband) and we LOVED it. The atmosphere was great and it was reasonably priced.\n\nWe ate here for lunch with my parents right after we got into Vegas because Urbanspoon indicated that they had gluten free options (for my mom and sister). \n\nAnd here is where I want to go into a little rant. If you're in the food industry, you should care about food. (I'm not talking about teenagers working as waitresses at a TGIFridays.) I'm talking about managers of restaurants who charge more than $12/plate. \n\nI don't appreciate watching someone become rude with my mother while she makes sure my sister doesn't get sick by eating YOUR FOOD. \n\nManagement didn't help at all and the waitress couldn't have looked more bored. No one asked us if our food was good (because it wasn't...it was greasy) and I don't plan on going back to any Macaroni Grill in the near future."
"5","Loving this place.  Yah it's a chain.  So what?  They provide a quality product at a fair price consistantly.  The chianti is great with any pasta on the menu.\n\nI always opt for the \""create your own pasta\"".  Very reasonable and you can pick from four sauces, five or six pastas and add veggies, meat whatever you want.  Not a bad deal.  Home baked bread is 5 stars!"
"2","Went in for a meal on Sunday night.  Not a great move.  The food was really not great even for a chain italian place.  Service was good, we sat at the bar to watch the Sunday night game.  \n\nI'm still not sure if the issue was the poor food, the poor menu, or something I can't nail down."
"2","Not thrilling.\nWe ordered take out for the office today, got a few lunch combos whole wheat fettuccine and soups, along with a couple salads.\nBut when I informed the cashier that I wanted the daily special soup instead of the tomato, as I am allergic to tomatoes, this did not seem to affect my receiving the tomato soup, and the whole wheat fettuccine meal was bland, dry with very fatty chicken, no comment from the salad eaters.\nThe tiramisu was very nice though, hence the two stars."
"2","Mediocre. They gave us no spoons, took way too long to bring the viddles, I received a tiny cup of tartar sauce for my fish, and the prices were too high. Not so clean either, but I'm glad my boyfriend took me here, because now I know I don't want to go back :P"
"1","I took my family here on Valentine's Day. What a disaster! The 45-minute wait was to be expected given that it was Feb. 14, but the hour-long wait to get our food wasn't. Plus, the food was terrible. The clam chowder had some weird spice in it and was congealed. Ick! The burger had a soggy bottom bun. The lobster bisque was gross. It tasted like butter and cream with very little lobster. The only thing I liked was the wedge salad (but it's hard to mess up a chunk of lettuce sprinkled with bacon, blue cheese and tomatoes.) We were all disappointed and will never go back."
"1","This is my 1st review and I'm taking it way back, over a year ago to our visit at Landry's. I had a gift card for this restaurant that I picked out as a reward from work. Came at lunch with my fam of 5, my parents and Aunty. \n\nFirst off we were the only customers and service took way too long. If it was super busy I'd understand....My dad(not the pickiest eater) actually complained that his soup was too salty. They took it away but didn't return it with another or say sorry or anything. It was awhile back but the food was not memorable at all. \n\nWorst part about the visit was they told me the card couldn't be used this time. Every single time I and my co-workers used this type of gift card we Never had a problem. They had this long explanation that it had to be mailed and next visit they would honor the discount yada yada yada and some other confusing stuff. \n\nAnywho I just wanted to get this bad visit (service and food) off my chest. Unfortunately after all this time still not forgotten. Hopefully I can move on. Bad on me I didn't question the gift card issue more(although and at least we spoke to manager at the time). And demand a new soup for my dad. A bad but learning experience nonetheless."
"3","Came in for lunch with family. Food was great however the service today was not.  We ordered our drinks and it took the waitress about 20 mins to come back with them after she served a group of 6 that came in after us.  She had someone else bring us our drinks and it was probably because I kept looking around to find her.  When she came to take our order she seemed like she didn't really want to be at work or something because her response to our questions were one word.  I ordered the king crab with a baked potato and asked for the crab to be cracked and no chives on my potato. After placing our order, she tells us in a rude manner \""is that all\"".  The complimentary salad was not fresh and taste odd. Once we received our order, the server placed a \""hot\"" plate in front of my son and swooshed his hand when he attempted to touch it.  I understand not wanting him to burn himself but why place it directly in front of him if it's that hot?  The plate was not hot at all as the server mentioned and I was pretty upset with her swooshing my son's hand away.  When my king crab and potato came, it was not cracked and I had an overwhelming amount of chives on my potato.  I did not receive anything to crack them with, butter, or anything that normally comes with a crab lunch/dinner order.  I asked if they could be taken back and cracked and the server says \""oh I forgot to put that in the computer\"". Not a problem. She takes them back and it takes 10 mins to get them back. We eat our meal, and our server does not return for quiet sometime. We see her waiting on other tables but she never makes it back to our table until I begin looking around for her again. She finally comes and ask if we need anything and refills our drinks.  We finish our meal, pay and leave. We have never had bad service prior to this visit, and I give 3 stars because the food was good as always. Service could have been so much more better. Hopefully next time we visit it will be great service."
"3","The staff hears what they want to hear. They don't really care what you say or order. I mean, I barely got \""cafe\"" out of my mouth and the dude was already gone. What if I didn't want condensed milk, huh? What of that? Same thing for pho orders. And AND the menu had me flustered due to their lack of rice plates. Who does that? Who doesn't have just charbroiled pork as the first thing on the list of rice plates? \n\nDespite my complaints, the egg rolls were excellent! Loads of filling in them! And the coffee was old school, with the metal drip thing and the cup of ice. Pho was good, but something about 105 degree heat makes me not want to eat a big hot soupy bowl of pho."
"3","Of course going to Vegas with my Vietnamese family meant getting our pho fix on at least once in Vegas during our stay, this time, it was on our way out from Vegas. This is one of the better pho restaurants in Vegas, they have everything on their menu and reasonably priced too! Their service is kinda sucky, but I guess that's understandable since this place is packed all hours of the day until closing. I guess this place is the place to be when you need your pho fix. Obviously they're not as good as what you can find in your mom's kitchen or possibly out in Bolsa but its decently priced and tastes good enough. This is obviously a come-back place. duh. lol."
"3","This was our first foray into Vietnamese food since moving to LV.  What can I say?  It wasn't bad.  But it wasn't anything to write home about.  If I could I'd give it a 2.5.  I decided to round up for now.  \n\nWe tried pho, bun, and spring rolls.  We liked the spring rolls (though the sauce was a bit watery and too salty).  The bun (vermicelli) was pretty good.  The pork was nicely seasoned but they skimped on the shrimp.  The pho broth felt a little light...could've been more flavorful.  But the worst part?  It left both my husband and me feeling dehydrated and with dry mouths.  Sure signs of MSG overdose.  Yuck-O!  :("
"4","I've heard a lot about this place from other Yelpers, but I've also read the stigma that comes with this place: Long waits, bad service, bringing out wrong items....  But people claimed the food was good, so I decided to toss myself to the ring and see what happens.\n\nI'm not a major pho fan.  My experience largely extends to cracking jokes of the \""Pho real\"" variety (yes, this is what I do).  For all the concern, however, none of the problems listed in reviews really happened in my experience.  Fast service, it sometimes took a moment to get the server's attention, but they were attentive when you did, they brought out something that we didn't ask for... not as a mess up, but they had an extra and offered the side dish for us to try just because.\n\nThe food itself?  Again, pho is not my usual first choice, but it's good to break out of the comfort zone, and to all credit, the food was tasty.   It was all well cooked, flavorful, and diverse.  I enjoyed it, felt full, and had a pleasant lunch.  Really, that's all I want from a dining experience.\n\nWhen the check came, the price was not bad at all.  Two people for less than $20 is NOT a bad deal.\n\nIf I have another experience like this, I'll gladly return here.  As I said, pho is not usually my first meal craving, but the experience that I had here will ensure that it won't be my last."
"3","I usually never have a car when I', in Vegas but I did one time and I came here for a Pho run. Although it's not the BEST pho I've had I think it's pretty good for Pho in Vegas, where there are plenty of non-authentic Asian food on the strip. The prices were pretty reasonable for pho so no complaints there.\n\nWe ordered the Pho Dac Biet and eggrolls... I think I've had bigger bowls of Pho in the SGV but their soup was piping HOT when it came out, which I loved! I hate lukewarm soup... The veggies all looked pretty clean and washed so that was also a plus. \n\nOverall, I would come back if I had a car, but with it being off the strip, I'm not sure that I would taxi it all the way here and back,,,"
"4","I love Pho Meatball Soup and this place delivers. It isnt the best I have had ever but its the best I have had in Vegas. Pho in Seattle is everywhere and the market is developed where Vegas is much more limited in selections of Pho. The places here seem to be a bit less in quality than Seattle because their isn't the stiff competition, but this place was pretty tasty. I had #16 Pho w Meatball and I had the tendon one a day or two later. Both were very good and was what should be expected. I have not ventured into much else on the menu yet, but I would highly recommend, as for Las Vegas Pho this does the job pretty well."
"2","Doesn't even taste like pho, nor smell like it.\n\nI had asked for extra veggies in my vermicelli, and it looked like they put in less than most places normally would if i had not asked for extra. This plate was ok.\n\nMy seat had a bunch of rips in it, and when you sit on ripped leather it kinda hurts if you wear a dress/shorts."
"1","I had such high hopes for this place because of the high reviews, but i was sadly disappointed, my pho dac biet arrived so clear i could see all the way to the bottom of the bowl, i had never had pho broth that was extremely clear i feel like they just gave me a bowl of salt water with noodles and beef in it...after i got done eating i felt like i had a belly full of seawater. This is the second pho place i have tried and will not be back, i recommend jenni pho instead."
"5","Bun Bo Hue.... that is all I have to say. You don't always find bun bo hue with that much flavor but this place has it all. I'll be back for sure"
"2","Dont eat here its nasty and they recycle their food.. The only good thing about this restaurant is its damn cheap hhahaha if you are cheap and want cheap quality of food then you eat here you cheap ass hahahah"
"4","My name is Gavin. I am a pho-a-holic. Let my share my story. \n\nI am a weekly regular here at Pho So1 for a reason! Having tried many pho places in LV, I keep coming back to this one for one thing...THE SOUP. This is the hands down best pho in Vegas. No questions. It's food crack, really. I just can't get enough. The broth has mystical powers and calls to me at strange times, begging for my return. The noodles and meat mingle in the bath of harmonious flavor and never fail to make me mmmmmmmm. Always order the Dac Biet #10 if you're really hungry or 14 if you're just normal. Tender brisket, delicious flank, melty chewy tendon and tripe if you want it. It's heaven in a bowl, baby. It'll cure what ails ya. Thank you Pho So1, for making me an addict.\n\nOnly words of wisdom, avoid the lunch rush on the weekend especially and order quickly.. Some days they get crazy busy and service suffers. Still, I love em to death."
"4","PROS: Delicious, hot food! The egg rolls (#1) are crazy good. I go here all the time and order completely different things each time, and I'm never disappointed. I've tried everything from soup to rice dishes! the taste is authentic and great :) \n\nit's cheap($13 and below), healthy, and comes in big portions, which I love! \n\nIf you ask, they are happy to tell you what the most popular, most delicious items are. Mainly because the list to order from is pretty long! \n\nCONS: The service can be either excellent or iffy depending on who is serving you. \n\nSometimes getting a table can be a bit of a wait. \n\nBathrooms need to be cleaned better! lol"
"5","Got introduce here by my ex boss. Really nice place to have lunch or dinner. Food are great. I'd say A+ to their service. Will come here more often."
"1","About 3 weeks ago I came to this place to eat pho, my experience with pho was really bad..slow down on the MSG, you don't want to kill the customer before they can finished their food and to day I got vietnames upon noodles (banh canh). Do you think all of your customers is stupid. When you say pork,shrimp, and crab the customer expect everything to be included not missing and say that it doesn't come with it. You charge me extra for it, when I can just get the regular for the figure price."
"5","We've been coming here for a while now and it's always a great experience.  Right when you walk in and get seated, right away you get a glass of water and get a few moments to look through the menu. Once you place your order the wait is not too long. comes out nice and hot and great portion also. the customer service on the other hand can learn how to smile, be up beat, and look like they want to help. besides all that great place to eat!! \n\nwe order number 14 on the menu most of the time. we would recommend it."
"1","Pho broth is no good. Service is no good. There are plenty of other pho places in the area. This one was not worth my time and money."
"2","So the family drove all the way to Vegas from LA to eat at a subpar Pho restaurant.  This is so typical of an Asian family.  So we walked in with a party of 15 and it took 10-15 minutes for us to get seated.  I understood that as this is not a normal sized party.  I ordered the spring rolls with shrimp and pho xe lua.  First off, I noticed how much more they charged here compared to LA.  \nThe spring rolls were just ok.  Didn't have much flavor to it.  The dipping sauce did help, but still not that good.  My pho came out and I wasn't sure it was mine because it was a regular sized bowl.  From my experience, xe lua is supposed to be an extra large.  I thought that's why I paid extra for it.  I even asked the server and he said that the xe lua was the same as the dac biet.  \nI was confused, but I still ate it and didn't make a big deal about it.  When I took my first bite, I was underwhelmed by the taste.  The soup didn't have that much flavor even after putting in the hoisin, veggies and lime.  The noodles wasn't fresh tasting like I'm used to.  I forgot to mention that the food was luke warm.  It's not piping hot like it's supposed to be.  The meat was just ok.  Nothing out of the ordinary.  \nAll in all, I would not come back to this establishment if I am ever in Vegas and craving for Pho.  There are so many other choices to choose from, and this one really bites.  The thing that really confuses me is that this is part of a chain and there is one located in Van Nuys that taste better than this place.  Food quality is definitely lacking at this Vegas location and they need to re-evaluate their whole business strategy."
"3","Tried this place on the advice of a Vegas local who highly recommend the place. Good place to try if you're craving some pho. \n\nOverall, food was good, nothing spectacular but nothing horrible either. The biggest down side was the service, they weren't rude but it was hard to find any help. Took a while for our server to take our order and for our food to come to us (bigger groups who came in after us received their food first). But after we received our meal, our server was nowhere to be found, we had to ask other servers passing by for help."
"4","BEST BANH MI IN VEGAS\nI compared the banh mi here with Hue Thai Sandwiches and Pho Thanh Huong Restaurant (the one by UNLV).  I liked this sandwich the best of the three.\n\nI ordered the #1 House Special and every bite was fresh tasting.  It measures 9.75\"" long on good bread with fresh ingredients and good meat for $3.  \n\nThere was no one in front of me and I waited about 2 minutes for my sandwich but there can be a line during lunch.  \n\nSee full review of all three sandwiches at www.DeepFriedKimchee.com"
"5","Video poker, topless dancers, 7 am to 7pm happy hour, the DJ is amazing, best party location in Vegas...enough said"
"3","Decided to have dinner at Tofu Hut tonight. Overall experience was not bad, but I wouldn't call it great either. \n\nThey were a bit short staffed when we first walked in. I would say it took them over 5 mins to even acknowledge our presence even though they did see us walk in.  I expected a \""Hello, or Welcome\"" at the very least.\n\nWe passed on the AYCE tonight & went ala carte. We ordered short ribs & spicy chicken. Both orders were good, but nothing memorable or anything to rave about. I did love their banchan offerings! I liked the fish cake, japchae, spicy cucumber, and I don't recall the others but it was yummy!\n\nI would go back.. but don't think I'll be a regular at this place."
"2","Service: 0/5 Wasn't the most welcoming that's for sure. When I walked in I stood in the door way/waiting area for like 5 minutes as I waited and stared at each employee of this place idk maybe because I wasn't Korean I wasn't getting the best service at the door. Finally we got seated, I felt rushed by my waitress and trust me after she dropped off our dishes that was the last time I saw her. She never came back to refill our waters or anything. Flagging someone down just to pay the bill was also an issue no one paid attention to us. \n\nKim Chi Beef: 3/5  I liked their Kim Chi beef but it doesn't compare to other places I've tried. A bit mediocre it was very watery and salty. I had huge chunks of Kim Chi which I liked but I had no idea where he \""beef\"" was. I'm guessing it had to be some sort of ground beef. The tofu was cooked perfect though not too soft not to hard\n\nSeafood Beef: 2/5  My boyfriend got this dish because he loves sea food in this Tofu, but omg super salty it tasted to bland not even tasty. There was barely any sea food in his the only thing I could recall were scallops and they tasted like imitation scallops. The tofu was cooked perfect though not too soft not to hard\n\nSide dishes: 2/5 I actually really liked their assortment of side dishes but our waitress was never around to refill them. I was pretty disappointed."
"1","Korean bbq is so good and I was excited to try this place with all the good reviews. The restaurant is pretty small and grills are at each table. \n\nThe staff wasn't very excited to help my friends and I. It was a quiet night and they could have been a little more excited to have people. They never came to refill our drinks, refill our meat, or our sides. All you can eat- yeah right! :(\n\nThe staff also sat up by the very loud TV the whole time and ignored pretty much any one who didn't need to be seated. They also took 20 min to give us the check. They asked the table next to us to \""hurry up, people need their table,\"" which was pretty rude! The bathrooms were a disaster which makes me wonder what the kitchen/fridge looks like..\n\nI have the feeling had I been Korean the service would have been a bit better...Even my Korean friends agree the service is bad! Major disappointment!! \n\n*Try some place clean where people actually want your business!"
"3","I was introduced to this place by a friend of mine and it is an all you can eat dine in restaurant but only on the left side. The prices range between $15-18 for the all you can eat. They do not have a menu on this side, they basically just have a list of the meats you can choose from and it is unlimited including the sides. I give the food four-stars, as the food is delicious. I love Korean food and sides! However, I need to give the service three-stars. \n\nThe first time I went there it was around 5pm, there was no line and we were seated fairly quickly. We had a lady serving us and she was nice but very hard to flag down. I enjoyed the food there especially the brisket and the sides. I was just not impressed by the service. \n\nThe second time we went there, we decided to go to dinner and we brought our friend with us. I made sure to arrive early to get us seats. The all you can eat side was pretty full so I stood by the sign that says, \""wait to be seated\"". No one was behind me at the time so I did not mind waiting. However, another person arrived and spoke to one of the servers. He decided to seat them first which I'm sure would upset a few people. I spoke to him before he seated them and explained that I was clearly standing there first and he should not have sat them before me as I was waiting and was not with their party. My friends arrived soon after he seated that party of three I was not too happy about that. I had a good time otherwise, but I just feel that in order to get more people into the place, the service has to be just as good as the food. If you don't mind good food, but lousy service, you should try this place."
"3","We had the a la acarte, and sat on the other side.  The other side was for all you can eat with the \""cook your own meat grill\"".  The service was good and fast; which is what you expect at most asian restaurants.  The bulgogi was really good.  I have been looking for a place that had the same taste and flavor as the one back home; and this one is quite similar.\n\nThe only thing was the cleanliness of the restaurant.  It wasn't in tip-top shape.  And, I don't like eating while I have to shoo a fly away.  Next time, I may just have the order to go.  Ohh, and another thing..it was a little pricey than I had expected.  Typically, you can judge at how much a restaurant will be based on looking at the restaurant.  I think the bulgogi was $14?!  A little steep."
"4","Ah KBBQ - I almost didn't believe it when a friend described it as \""all you can eat meat buffett\"" but it was true, and a dream come true!\n\nThere are a couple AYCE KBBQ here in town, most right up in Chinatown on Spring Mtn. For the most part there are same, with some slight variations. Tofu Hut is one my favorite though.\n\nTofu is set-up where they bring the meet to you. Its a small place so there really isn't much room for you to actually go up and get the food yourself. This of course puts you at the mercy of the wait staff. But usually their service is on point and there isn't much of a delay in getting what you want.\n\nThe prices are pretty cheap when compared to some of the other KBBQ joints. AYCE is $17, and they knock off $4 after 10pm. They have the full of assortment of Korean meats: brisket, bulgogi, pork belly, squid, beef tongue, and the like. I absolutely love the Kalbi, its delicious as is the steamed egg. (I have been calling it egg soup and no one has ever bothered to correct me).\n\nDespite the name Tofu.. this place is anything but it. Overall a above average KBBQ spot and a great value."
"4","Went here with some friends for the all you can eat dinner. Pretty cheap compare to other place and the food was good. We got seated as soon as there was a table available. We order our meats and our server was very attentive refilling our drinks and bring more meat as we ordered. Everything was great from the beginning. But beware of smelling like Korean food as you leave!"
"1","We went to Tofu Hut because mr. Tofu is closed on sunday. A few tables were bbqing meat and we ordered one sun-tofu and one guk-su. The side dishes were all suck!! Jab-che was over seasoned with too much soysauce. Kimchi was too old and jun was all burned. One side of jun was all black and tasted nothing more than flour. Sun-tofu was not bad but not good either. We ordered spicy but it wasnt spicy at all. Guk-su was terrible. Too much vinegar was used.. i almost threw up while eating. Staff was not bad. They walj around with ice water and refill it everytime you ask. Overall i will never go back. I cant believe tofu hut became this horrible. It wasnt used to be this bad. I will rather wait until mr. Tofu opens on weekdays. Please do taste before serving dishes to customers!!!"
"2","First time back in a long time...It's either gotten worse, or I've learned of better KBBQ in town....or both!\n\nWasn't a big fan of the meats truthfully...the only one that had flavor was the Marinated Pork Belly, and maybe the marinated chicken...the rest were a little boring and tough even after a quick sear.  Pic of the meats : http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tofu-hut-las-vegas?select=zCo32peMlhCJI_0H7q1SUg#zCo32peMlhCJI_0H7q1SUg\n\nPic of the meats cookin' :  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tofu-hut-las-vegas?select=YuJt74AHAnh24_SqZNedLg#YuJt74AHAnh24_SqZNedLg\n\nThe banchan was ok.  Nothing really stood out, but the servings were plentiful.  When we ran out of kimchi, they resupplied quickly after a request.  Pic : http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tofu-hut-las-vegas?select=vHznYxpqkzfUaFttHH7JUA#vHznYxpqkzfUaFttHH7JUA\n\nOnly half of the dining area has BBQ grills, so expect a wait.  Ours was about 30min, around 930pm on a weekday.  Not a big deal to me, just expect it.\n\nThe only thing they really have going for them are the prices.  It's about $14 for AYCE during 10pm+, so they are almost half price of most places.  But unless you can't afford the extra few dollars out on the town, do yourself a favor and look elsewhere for KBBQ."
"3","I come here for the AYCE KBBQ. The meat here is better than most KBBQ place in Vegas for almost half the price.  They don't have much of a side order selection but the salad and the sides that come with the meal is good.  The only problem is that half the restaurant is for KBBQ so seating is very limited and it can take very long to get a table when it's busy.  The service is decent.  A server will come around now and then and ask if you want to order more but its hard to get their attention when they are  running around."
"4","Takes a long time to clean up table. But its understandable cos grill is hot n need cool down, i suppose. The price is really good but the meat, especially the short ribs are not tender. \nI would not be a regular here, just because the smell afterward in your clothes is horrific, we suppose plan go Hakasan  right after dinner. But once i get in the car, that BBQ smell is just a turn off. So word of advice is that make sure your next stop is shower lol.\n\nI wish there is a 3.5 start, because that is what it earned."
"4","If you are look for a good place to eat at Vegas and it is after 10:00PM this is the place to go. You would want to come with an empty stomach since this place is a All You Can Eat Korean BBQ. I dare you to come out of this place not smelling like Korean BBQ. So if you plan to go to a party after you might wanna bring a change of clothes. If this is your first time trying Korean BBQ let me tell you that the smell will linger on your clothes and hair. \n\nThis is an AYCE location starting at 10:00pm-2:00am and it only cost $18-20 depending on the tipping amount. This is a great deal since NYC prices are outrageous of this type of food. Along with the Korean BBQ meat that you order it comes with Banchan. Banchan are small tradition Korean side dishes such as kimchee, bean sprout, fish cake, pancake etc. If these dishes run out you can always ask for more. I am used to my basket of fresh lettuce but instead they served chop lettuce with some dressing. This is a complete shock to me, maybe the basket of fresh lettuce is a NYC thing. The basket of fresh lettuce here is served like a salad with a fresh sesame dressing. \n\nI will recommend  this brisket, marinated pork belly and sliced sliced rib-eye. I will stay away from the squid because it comes really elastic when it is cooked. The marinated pork belly was my favorite because it comes with so much favor. Keep in mind that this place does not change the Korean BBQ grill. Since the pork belly is marinated the grill turns black quicker and they will not replace it until you finish the dinner. \n\nThe restaurant is split into two parts. When you walk in the left side is for Korean BBQ quest. They have 6 tables that can seat 4 people each and 3 long table that can hold at least 8 individuals. The right side are for guest who do not want to eat Korean BBQ but just want Korean food. \n\nThe only reason this place lost a star is because of service and the wait. I came at 10:03pm and had to wait for an hour to get seated. The service is slow and they seem like zombies. When the table before us finish eating it took 10 minutes to clean the table and when the table was clean the waitress did not call us until another 10 minutes has passed. So the turn around rate for the table is around 20 minutes because they lack the help. Since only two people are working it takes a lot longer for wait and the meat to come out. If they hired more help this place would have earn five stars. \n\nHint: When you walk in place your name, time you came in and number in your party on that sheet of paper near the door. This place get pack after 10:15pm!"
"3","I always come here during lunch because they have good specials on the tofu soup! It's cheap, delicious & comes with a lot of food! And usually the service is quick- not too long of a wait.\n\nHowever, I ate here for dinner the other night and the wait was ridiculously long! It was just a party of 2 but we waited over an hour. What made me angry was the fact that there were seats open!! There were at least 4 tables open but they didn't fill those up. They made us wait an hour and they finally sat us- at the table that was open this entire time!!! \nWe did the all you can eat and it was only $16.99. Lots of food & it was good~ love their short ribs!!\nIt's good, cheap food but you just have to wait a looooong time!"
"5","Best Korean BBQ in Vegas. Love their marinated pork belly and squid. Their salad is addicting. Staff is friendly. Can be a long\nwait on weekend nights, but that's to be expected. My go to Korean BBQ spot!"
"3","A La Carte menu:\nI've been to Tofu Hut plenty of times before and no other Korean place I've went to had tofu soup comparable to this place. Sometimes salty, but nonetheless distinctive. I usually order the Bulgogi combination and Short Rib combination which are about $13-14 each including soups and sides. For the price, the food is quite a bit and enough to get a group of three to four full which is great. I tend to finish up the sides too. Rice cake, noodles, spiced cucumbers, kimchi, beans sprouts-yummy.\n\nDownsides?:\nBulgogi was overcooked this time I went... not too much of a biggie because the short ribs were perfect. The biggie was customer service. When I asked one of the employees politely for a refill of a side, she walked right past me without acknowledging me, then returned later just taking the dish without saying anything or looking at me. She quickly came back with a refill but I found it rather rude not being acknowledged at all...as if I wasn't there. Not cool. Overall, service is inconsistent every time I head here. Depends on server of course, but everyone on Yelp knows I love friendly people and tip generously for it. For Tofu hut, I realized not to expect much from staff anymore.\n\nI like eating here for quick fix Korean. If it wasn't for my affinity towards the soup here, I'd prefer the ambiance and experience at Soyo (located Rainbow Blvd/Warm Springs)"
"2","This place is very small. I had to wait for 1hr to be seated.  The food was not the best because the grill was not working. I think I ate raw pork and chicken because the grill was messed up. There was so much smoke coming from our grill that they didn't brother to fix it after we were done eating raw meat. Place was too small and not worth going even if the price was cheap."
"1","This place gets my vote for the worst KBBQ experience ever. The meats were awful and poor quality. Also worth mentioning is their horrible banchan. It was not fresh nor did it taste good. I usually ask for seconds or thirds when it comes to banchan too. It made me really miss the L.A. KBBQ joints. The soon tofu was extremely, uncomfortable spicy! It gave me really bad heartburn. I can handle spicy food too."
"1","We went there last night around 12:30am. Tofu Hut was open for another hour and a half. Two families of 6 were seated and immediately after the lady working there told us we were not welcome to eat there after we've already waited 15 minutes to eat.\n\nI'm not sure why exactly we were profiled and there were several open tables."
"3","I honestly love love Korean Barbecue. It is my absolute favorite thing to do! Tofu hut is a great place to get KBBQ. I love this place. The meat is great, the marination is a little sweet but Americans would love them. The meat that they give you is frozen. Like they had a frozen block of meat and cut them right before they give it to you so the meat is frozen when they bring it to you. \nThe salad is great, a little salty but still good. A long with the kimchi, salty but good. Their other sides are pretty good as well. I love love the pickled cucumber.\nAnd I don't know if it's an Asian thing or it's just them but they're very \""not attentive\"" if that makes sense. Like they could careless about their customers. Every time we asked for something, they always give us this \""ugh, again?\"" face. I'm Asian myself and I've worked with a lot of customers but I would never do that. They're stingy and doesn't want to give you the food. I had to order brisket and beef tongue like 3 times before I got them. If they were busy I would understand but no one was there. They just seemed very careless. \nFood quality wise, it's very good and delicious. \nCustomer service wise, it was pretty bad. \nThey charged us the 18% gratuity and there was only 4 of us in our party so that's another thing. I don't mind tipping at all, I really don't. I do it according to the service that was provided but the service was pretty bad. \nUsually I give more then 18% but since they want just 18% I just let them. \nIf you're looking for good food and don't care about service, I say go for it! \nIf you want service and don't want to cook your own food, I say pass."
"4","This place is great.  The staff is really friendly and the chile verde burrito is fantastic.  You know a mexican restaurant is good when most of the customers are hispanic.  I eat here for lunch three or four times a week.  Best cheap mexican food in Vegas."
"3","All of the same things I wrote 2 yrs ago still apply here.  Great spot with a great selection of jewelry and watches.  Service is still spotty, but if you happen to be there when Ladera is working, she'll take good care of you.  She's very friendly and knowledgable about the items in the store.  She will also check for you if there's any room for negotiation.  Other than that her, most of the other people who work here are not as friendly.\n\n4 Stars for product offering, 2 Stars for spotty service.  Ladera gets a solid 4 Stars.  This is still on my rotation of shops to visit when I'm back in Vegas.\n\nReturn Factor - 80%"
"3","24/7 Local video poker sports bar, everything you'd expect. It seems like I'm always just stopping in for a cheap breakfast, the Pt's Platter is way better than its Ihop and Denny's counterparts and the waitresses are much friendlier. Unfortunately, I always get sucked into the video poker machines and end up leaving with a full tummy and an empty wallet."
"2","It's good thing I don't like a lot of sales support when shopping for footwear because no one shopping here got any!\nCashier also brusquely informed me that the boots he was ringing up for me \""didn't match\"" without telling me why (I had a left one and a right one in the same size) and stalked away to find some that did. He substituted one of them and clucked loudly when I asked if I could try them on again and stalked back to the register, where I caught up with him to pay for my Ariats, he asked for the \""last 4 numbers on the front of\"" the card he'd just had in his hand, again without telling me why. \nIt's also a good thing I know how to check credit card transactions.\nThis was my second purchase there under less than ideal service circumstances. No charm, no third time."
"1","The owner is very rude. I had been a cust for almost 7 months. I had him order me a price guide $30 , for my comic con trip. I gave him over 3 1/2 months heads up. He gave it to me in sep. Thats over 2 months after comic con. He told me that its not his fault and that i needed to pay for it or get the hell out. I told him that i would leave. On top of that he only takes cash and has had a few run ins with the irs on taxes. A shady guy. Be careful. I never been there again. This guy did me a huge favor. All he did was smoke pot in his store and talk about nasty sex acts he did back in the day ... In front of my wife!!!!!!!! His teeth are all rotted out and on top of that he stands soo close to u. Yuck. I now go to maxim comics the best store in l v."
"3","Some reviews say Steve's a jerk. I wouldn't say that for my experience. It's obvious that regulars get priority. I understand that. Some people like myself want to browse and accidentally find something we can't live without. \n   Shoppers beware though... I wouldn't recommend bringing in kids. I had my 5 yr old daughter with me looking around. Very seedy environment. \""Adult\"" pictures/magazines/cards that are out in the open. If that's your thing, so be it, but comic book stores should be family friendly. After all kids were where it all started. \n    They do have a great selection and Steve is very knowledgeable. Not the kind of place I'll come back to. Sorry.  Put the \""Adult\"" material behind the curtain and I'll be back."
"1","Get out of the business Lowes!  Home Depot knows what they are doing so get out of their way.\nSound harsh?  read on then judge for your'e self.\nI manage 3 4 plex apartments here in las vegas, and needed 2 sets of counter tops for 2 units that I was quoted 1/2 of what Home Depot wanted.  Time was critical these units are being rented by two families that live in their cars currently because they are down on their luck.  (my employer is very generous and rehabs units for low income housing giving people a second chance)\nI went to Lowes on w. charleston and the price was more than 2x what i was quoted on the phone.  I was in a hurry so I ordered them and was assured they would be there on 6-13.  I called 6-13 told they were not in and called 6-14, & 6-15 again told they were not in.  Turns out they were in the whole time but the employees were too lazy too look on the back of the counters to see who they belonged to.\nWhen Lowes finally found the counters they had made a mistake and ordered the wrong size they were both too short.\n6-26 Lowes has the counters in and they are too short a second time.  Store manager  Ben is supremely disinterested and I am pushed off to the counter top guy again.  I explain I need the counter top 8' not 7' he seems to understand this time.  \n6-27 Lowes calls to take measurements themselves because they still haven't ordered the right size yet!  I met counter top guy on site show him I need 8', he leaves assures me he will order as soon as he gets back to store.\n6-28 4:30 pm (today) I get call from Lowes they screwed up the credit card charge and haven't ordered the tops yet!\nMeanwhile I have 2 families living in their cars waiting on counter tops so the county will let them move in and Lowes can't seem to get it together!\nAs if this wasn't enough, I was assured that the area manager Lary Ednes from Lowes would call to help me out with this problem.  Well Larry, its been 3 days and counting; each day I'm assured by your office i will receive a call that day and nothing.\nHelloooo?  Lowes,? is anybody home?\n\nLowes your slogan is \""Lowes never stop improving\"".  Well when are you going to start?"
"1","Do not order service from this store.\nAbysmal customer service from the install sales team.\n\nThey installed a 2 brand new HVAC units on the roof of our duplex.\nThey had to cut into our (NON LEAKING) roof to install it.\nIt leaked.\n\nIt's Las Vegas - you don't find these things out until a really heavy monsoon. We found out less than a year after install. It leaked in both places where they cut the holes for the return ducts. We reported it and the installer came out and supposedly fixed the leaks.\n\nAnother year goes by before another truly heavy monsoon. And the roof is still leaking in the same place on one of the units!!! We call again. This time, it takes over a week to get a customer service person out to look at it. \n\nLowes says the labor is not warranteed after the first year. AND most importantly - THEY HAVE LOST THE RECORD of our reporting THE LEAK the first time around WITHIN the year warrantee period. To top this off - the company Lowes contracted with, Phoenix Air, has gone out of business!\n\nLowes, you really really suck."
"2","Walked in to pick something up from the ship to store department, and the register is closed but next to it is layway and there were 5 people in line and the gentlemen at the register said that the other lane/register is closed.  I told him \""call for help then, because I'm not here for layway\""  2 other ladies in line agreed and said they were waiting too because no one would come help him.   Well it happened that we were near the employee back entrance or something and I told someone in that back hallway to immediately go call someone to help this guy out because we are not all here for layaway and no one is helping him.  Within 2 minutes someone came to help him.   They were still a little slow but not nearly as bad as before.  It still took almost 30 min from the time I came in, to the time I finally got my 2 items and they allowed me to pull around back to pick it up because it was too large to wheel through the store on a flatbed cart.  \n\nNot necessarily poor service but definitely LACK OF HELP to properly take care of customers!"
"1","This location is terrible. I usually don't shop at Walmart, mostly because of their policies and politics, but in this case I was shopping online and they had 1 of the items I was looking for in stock so I ordered for store pick up so I wouldn't have to wait for it to be shipped from another online retailer. When I showed up to pick up my item, I waited for about 30 min in the customer service line before being told I was in the wrong line. Seriously? Why wasn't I told this in the pick-up email or why wasn't there a sign posted?!\n\nI then made my way to the back of the store near layaway, which also doubles as a Walmart .com pick-up counter. There were only 2 people in front of me but I waited another 20-30 min there before it was my turn because there was only 1 associate at the counter. When I got up to the counter, the associate left for a while with no explanation while I stood there for about 5 min wondering whether anyone was going to return to assist me. When the associate finally returned and looked up my order, she shouted to another person to grab my order for her so that she could run to the bathroom. Talk about customer service...what a hassle to shop at Walmart!"
"4","I've had my eye on Samosa Factory for some time, but finally got around to trying it last night when our first choice for dinner was closed for the holiday. \n\nWe entered the small dining area and were greeted by the incredibly friendly server. We told him we wanted to order our food to-go and he still offered us two glasses of water and a starter to nibble on while we perused the menu. We settled on the Lamb Vindaloo and the Chicken Tikka Masala. We also ordered some garlic naan. Our server was incredibly personable and offered us refills on our water while we waited as well as made some idle chit chat with us. \n\nOnce our food arrived, we paid our bill and off we went with our food. The server also offered us a to-go menu for our return visit. Great customer service!\n\nMy fella and I dug into our meal as soon as we got home. The spice level was just right. We ordered the medium spice level to be on the safe side on our first visit. The garlic naan was delicious and I really enjoyed the rice. The flavors were right on and I look forward to a return visit to hopefully eat in the restaurant and try some of their samosas. The food is not cheap, but I didn't feel it was overly expensive for the quantity and quality of food we got.\n\nDefinitely a great Indian option in a town that is lacking."
"5","After having our venue near our home cancel on us last minute due to structural issues, I felt panicked. We called multiple places in San Diego that were all booked or couldn't accommodate a last minute request. We came to Vegas after finding this place online. \nWe had our wedding here in Feb of 2013. It was absolutely perfect! The center pieces, lighting, food, atmosphere, etc was all exceptional. They were accommodating to requests and last minute changes! Everyone I met who worked here was nice and caring. You didn't feel like you were in Vegas. I think you get more than you pay for here. I would highly recommend this place."
"1","Nothing new at this place, they continue to remove the expiration dates\noff their food products. Someone needs to alert the clark county health department!!!"
"1","This place has thousands of albums in varying condition. It has a great selection of multiple genres of music. There are some rarities and very valuable collectibles. But the previous reviews are true: nothing has a price written on it... and once the gentleman behind the counter quotes you prices on some vinyl, you will be rendered utterly speechless. Whether you are a newbie, a veteran collector or even a dealer, he's going for the jugular! He quoted me $150 -200 (each!) on records that are readily available at other shops around the U.S.  (or even ebay) for $25 max!  He wasn't rude or obnoxious; he was simply hopelessly and completely unrealistic. Maybe he thinks he can gut the tourists or un-knowing younger people trying to build a collection. Bottom line: use the web to validate LP pricing or you will likely be hammered. \n\nThey're his albums. He amassed them, so he can ask what he wants for them. If he has children, maybe they like records (they are going to inherit some). He surely won't be selling many at 600% mark up!"
"1","I believe that the owner is Rick from my two phone calls with him I think it should be *rick. I asked what Sinatra box sets he had and reeled off the sets I was looking for and waited with baited breath all I got was a torrent off abuse and a hang up. As I was staying on the strip which I explained I did not want 2 needless taxi fares if the sets were not there or too expensive. Rick must struggle with the concept of customer service which in the USA I usually find to my liking he must be a lottery winner who does not need the money. If they could only relocate the shop to the Grand Canyon or under Lake Mead this would be a great help!!!!!!"
"1","Ok, time to bring these reviews down to reality.\n\nNote: I am not an Hawaiian food expert so if you are, take that into consideration.\n\nThis Resturant has Kitchen nightmare written all over it.  The Resturant itself is in TOTAL disrepair.  Lights and air conditioning don't work, the carpet is filthy, the tables are scattered with outdoor lawn chairs, cables hang from the ceiling, decor is beyond decayed.\n\nFOOD: based on reviews here, I had the Hawaiian plate.  The pork had over 1 pound of pure fat in it.   Maybe that's the Hawaiian way, but for me it looked totally disgusting.   My wife had the teriyaki bowl.  Parts of it were burnt and afterwards she was complaining her stomach hurt.  Rice was ok.\n\nDETAILS\nResturant:  1/10 (this ain't homey -- it's rundown)\nAmbiance:  1/10 (scary!)\nService: 5/10 (a little slow but friendly)\nCleanliness: 1/10 (board of health should be concerned.)\nFood: 1/10 (we were trying to determine what was editable. Not good.)\nRestroom: don't know.  I was too scared to go in.\nParking: 4/10 (small lot)\n\nOverall quality seemed to be totally lacking."
"3","My nails were chipping from too much dice throwing during the week, and since vegas sucks up my money all the time, I was looking for a quick and cheap manicure to do some repair before I headed back. This was the first place that popped up on yelp, and I headed over for the reviewed $10 manicure. \n\nFirst of all, the price was raised to $12 for a manicure now. Secondly, I feel like non-manhattan salons do not carry Essie. I've only visited 2 so far, but nobody has Essie which is my go to. I'm ok with OPI, which is a staple but its sad that they didn't have essie. \n\nThe lady that worked on my manicure was fine. She used a buffering machine thing, which is new for me. I've never had that type of treatment before. The manicure was fine, my nails lasted about a week or 1.5 weeks. \n\nThe establishment itself didn't feel very chic or anything, but its fine for a quick manicure. It's a nail salon and a hair salon together. Most of the workers are vietnamese, and theres one haircutting lady that's chinese. They're not too chatty which is what I like; I tend to zone out when I'm getting a manicure. and they're friendly and nice. It's located in the middle of a small shopping plaza near this large asian super market, which was convenient. \n\nI recommend this place if you're visiting vegas and you need a quick fix."
"1","Unbelievable. How the heck do you run out of crushed peppers and parmesan cheese?\n\nI should've run back in and grabbed a whole roll of those Bounty-like paper towels. Would've served them right."
"1","Horrible service. I ordered breadsticks, just breadsticks. It took 45 MINUTES! And the cook was eating while she cooked. Not secret snacking, she was chomping away at the food she was making!!  \nI was not asked size options, is there only one size? My sticks cost $4.50, which I thought was steep, and after, yes after I had already paid, and been given my change,.. she said \""it's going to be 15-20 minutes, is that ok?\"" Well considering you've already taken my money do I have a choice? SO I said yes and waited, tried my damnedest to be patient, when 40 minutes rolled around there was 5 of us standing at the counter saying \""come on, this is ridiculous\"". Because it was!! \n\nPizza Hut was a childhood favorite. I hadn't been to a Pizza Hut in YEARS, and I will NOT be going back :("
"1","Poor service (repeated my order three times and it was still wrong), loud music (probably the reason the girl could not hear me and got the order wrong), wrong change (even after I pointed it out, they did not correct it, the cashier walked away), no selection (no pastrami, no swiss, cheddar, only provolone, etc). Why would anyone want to eat here?"
"4","Yummy and cheap, cheap, cheap. \nThe boy and I were looking for a place to stop at on our way home from Chinese New Year, and decided to stop here, never having tried a hawaiian place before.. Which aparently, is an awful lot like Japanese? I guess? But with pineapples?\nAnyways, the boy got a teriyaki chicken bowl for under $4, and I got the garlic chicken with gravy for $7. Mine came with macaroni salad, which was meh. No real flavor at all to it. I'd probably just skip that part next time. But the garlic chicken was sooo so good, and the portion size was massive, 3 pieces of chicken and two rice scoops. I had to take half home. \nThe boy liked his teriyaki chicken bowl as well. Not as much food as the garlic chicken, but still more than enough. The teriyaki sauce had a nice pineapple tang to it, and the chicken was super tender."
"2","I ordered the \""grilled\"" mahi-mahi plate and ended up receiving a mahi-mahi omelette. I politely went to the counter to clarify my order, but the employee, a young kid, claimed the mahi-mahi plate is cooked with egg. If that is the case, then the menu should clearly state that. Not grilled. I didn't want to argue simply because I was wary of having something done to my reorder, didn't want to waste food, and was already starving. On top of that, the mahi-mahi omelettes were extremely bland (along with the side of mac salad) that I needed to add a lot of Aloha soy sauce which was probably the only best thing about my meal."
"1","So unprofessional. Lady that I've never seen there before was talking about her personal business like she was at home. She was venting about something to the others. Her face was ticked off. Keep your personal issues at home and serve your customers!"
"3","This was decent comfort food from back home.  Not worth a special trip but, if you're in the area, it is pretty good."
"1","The WORST customer service EVER! and here is why...\n\n1) I was at Aloha kitchen with my friends, and was trying to pay for my own entree.  Their fugly manager was asking me to pay for EVERYONE! and of course I said no.  Why would I? I am not Santa Claus and It's not even Christmas yet.  \n2) After I told her no I can't due to my financial hardship, she asked me to sell my bag that I was carrying with me.  (YOU DON'T FXXXING ASK YOUR CUSTOMER TO SELL THEIR BAG TO PAY FOR YOUR CHICKEN)\n3) Then, in front of my boyfriend and everyone, that fugly manager asked me to switch a boyfriend that would pay for everyone, and laughed.  (I WAS LIKE, \""WHY DON'T YOU JUST SERVE YOUR FOOD FOR FREE THEN, BITCH!) \n4) I told one of the guys that I will treat him a nice dinner next month because I am financially struggling these days.  And she told my friend to hang up on me if I ever call! (WHAT A BITCH!)\n\nI have never written a review before and I never thought I would ever write a review as horrible as this one.  BUT what I am writing here is the truth, and the truth is powerful.  The personality of the  manager at ALOHA KITCHEN is as hideous as her appearance.  Even though I was extremely disappointed and angered by her HORRIBLE service, now I pity her because she is just OH SO!! hideous inside and out.  \n\nSO!!! whenever any of you (who are reading this review) ever sees that fugly manager, you better be a BALLER and pay for EVERYONE you are with OR ELSE she will embarrass you to the MAX in front of everybody.\n\nGREAT JOB to the MANAGER at ALOHA KITCHEN! I will definitely spread the \""GOOD WORDS\""  :D"
"3","Was craving for a late Hawaiian meal with my coworkers and ventured  across town to find aloha kitchen. I had ordered the loco moco and I must say, it's not the best thing I ever had. The hamburger steak was so dry and lack any kind of flavor, the gravy was ok.  Would I come back? Sure, the prices were decent and might be worth trying again if I get one of those late night Hawaiian food cravings."
"2","This Irish bar is pretty typical for a casino.  I.E. there isn't much Irish to it.  But it does have a decent selection of beers.  Sometimes they bring in very weird bands or groups to play music.  I would say it would be worth stopping by and grabbing a beer.  Plus you can keep the glass."
"5","I came here as a recommendation from a friend, because I was getting tired of the ridiculous prices the big companies like Firestone and Midas were trying to charge me for work done that usually required more work in the near future!\n\nThey have AMAZING service, it's owned by a Japanese couple, who are very friendly and accommodating. I've take my car here twice, the first was to take a look at the control arm bushings, ball barings, structs, and suspension. They told me all I need to do is replace the control arm bushings, which costed at a fraction of what Firestone quoted me!! \n\nSecond time, was a bit of an emergency, my window regulator snapped and the window dropped. This posed as a safety to my car so I brought it in the moment it happened, they took a look at it, told me what it was and gave me a quote. They told me they could do it that day and finish before the shop closed! Which was a saver because it was Friday and they close on the weekends!!\n\nThey also use genuine parts from whatever manufacture your car is from! Best thing to do is go in for an estimate and set up an appointment for later in the week if it's not urgent. \n\nThe gentlemen that works in the office along with the owner's wife was very helpful both times and remembered who I was, he also speaks multiple languages!"
"1","They tryed to say my water pump was out when it was a fan relay that cost\n8$ \nSo getting a second opinion i saved hundreds\n\n\nThe guy lied and said they wont repair something i dont need \nI kinda believed him but i looked at my service records they did the timing belt and\nWater pump at 85000 miles \nReally disapointed then they said dont drive it \nOnce the relay was fixed the problem was gone\n\nParts quoted i needed\nWater pump\nThermostat\nlabor costs\nOver 500$ \n\nGet a second opinion esp if your visiting from california"
"5","No Complaints with this place! Support the little guy, (last mom and pop shop)  and if you ever need anything repaired this is the place Vegas!"
"3","I have to say there customer service is great, however I frown upon the fact that they charge $115.00 right off the bat just to look at something that needs a repair which binds you to have the repair done there or you lose your money. I wouldnt mind paying that on a large repair but for a small repair like a broken stearing wheel lock, it can be very pricey. Not sure if I want to go back to have this done."
"2","I was really excited to go here since I've craved it for so long and because the last time I tried to go here ended up being a super fail attempt..\n\nSo why the two stars?\n\nService was WHACK. I know I'm not coming here to get fine dining service but damn, can a girl get some hot sauce and ketchup? My boyfriend and I came here and got 10pc bucket, some biscuits, and a side of coleslaw. When we had questions while ordering (prices, etc.), all the guy who took our order would do was point to the menu and shake his head. I swear, I did not hear his voice at all until he announced the total price. \n\nAlthough we got the order pretty quickly, NOT ONLY did they not ask us if we wanted the chicken original or spicy, they also didn't ask if we wanted condiments, napkins, or even a fork for the coleslaw! They might as well should've left out the top and straw for my drink too! It took us at least 15 minutes to get it. I think these problems could have easily been avoided if there were a station set up already with that stuff, but then again the place is also pretty small.\n\nIf those biscuits weren't ON POINT, I would've given this place 1 star. It made me so sad :("
"2","Another quick lunch led me to this place. I headed straight to the drive-thru and ordered their lunch special: 4 tacos, a drink, and fries for $4.99. They get points for being quick (only waited about 5 minutes) and friendly. Unfortunately, that's about the best thing about this place. I ordered 2 carne asada tacos and 2 al pastor tacos. The tortillas were thick and gummy. The asada was dry and had little flavor. The al pastor was excessively greasy and the fries were forgettable. This might be good drunk food at 4 in the morning, but when you're sober... not so much."
"2","I have visited this place a few times now, a couple of times not so sober and I remember it was good then...\n\nMore recently I went back during lunch and the expeirence was not so stellar. The carne asada i got on my tacos had huge chucks of fat on them, I get trying to cut corners but if tacos jsut come with meat and tortilla make sure the meat is good. It was a bad experience, I guess I should go back to see if it was a fluke but don't really wanna watse a lunch when there are so many other good options out there. \n\nOnly good point it that it is cheap but you get what you pay for here, fat tacos not carne asada."
"3","Epoys offer a variety of food and snacks. food are always warm and tasty.\nHowever, this restaurant is no longer in business. a thai restaurant replaced it."
"1","i would love to give it zero stars if I could, (Yelp? maybe a feature you can implement??) anyway, bottom line I WISH i'd stopped by here and read the reviews before plunking down $26 on 2 lunches we could never get back!!\nfood is disgusting, bland, tasteless, hopeless, worse than mediocre, and I could go on and on.\nthere were total of 5 dishes, and rest of the lunch buffet was filled with lettuce, onions, chutneys, yogurt dips with no real veggies to actually dip in. the samosas were leaking of oil, pakoras were nasty didn't taste like pakora batter but stuffed with some dal of some sort to save money, the curries were GROSS ugh!!! and when u enter, u see all these awards plastered on the walls??/ who is handing these out???\ndon't go here...its full of retards serving nasty food that'll make u barf whether u're hung over or not."
"5","I go here every week with my husband and a group of friends.  I've noticed there are some negative reviews on here, and that came as a big surprise to me.  My husband and I have had Indian food in many different states and even different countries around the world.  After traveling around the world to find the perfect curry, I can tell you that this is the best.  I have not had better Indian food.  Truly."
"2","I went here back in August over the summer and it was so so. I went with a male friend that's a local but never had been, so we go to check it out. $30 cover, not to happy about that but whatever, so we get in. Because of my club hopping and drinking prior to come here I had to use the restroom, I hate using public restrooms or any that isn't my own toilet for that matter, so I go looking for the restroom to find its in the strippers dressing room. I see all these naked  girls changing, primping or whatever. The smell in this dressing room almost knocked me out. I'm a female, so I know how we should and should not smell, I'll leave it at that. I think they needed to bomb it with some FDS STAT!!! I hopped out of there fast quick and  in a hurry. I come back to sit finding my boy watching this stripper dance for him, and he has this perplexed look on his face. I ask \"" whats the matter with you?\"" He says \"" Her ass looks like she got hemorrhoids\"", says \"" come here and look\"" LOL  . I replied \""Hell No\"". I laughed so hard.  There was another dancer there who had guy friends act like they were random customers and making it rain all over her. My boy noticed it. I laughed at that too.  There was one girl that seem to be capable of doing the job. She was active, she actually could work the pole, and do some tricks too.  So all in all I can't be to mad about it. It was whatever, but funny as hell in the same token."
"5","First Vegas Strip Club experience. Little Darlings was an amazing experience lol. Hottest chicks, all nude, best overall value compared to other Strip clubs in Vegas which are topless only and super expensive. Went on a Tuesday, and it was awesome, plenty of girls, good atmosphere. They say the lap dances are two for one on Tuesday but it seems all the strippers had their own price, some say $20 for a lap dance others $40. Either way, great experience, fine girls for sure. Will go again next time I'm in Vegas. The only complaint is the cover which is $30 for visitors, and if you get money out of the ATM there it's a $10 fee which is insane so bring plenty of cash."
"2","Little Darlings is 100% nude, hence. no alcohol was served.  It's a little off the Vegas strip but not hard to find.  If you want an awesome VEGAS strip club experience, this is not the place.  It was dingy and cheap looking.  I felt kind of dirty stepping inside.  The girls were not in their perfect form.  Some of them were old and out of shape (to put it nicely).  If that's what I wanted to look at, I could have stayed home and looked in the mirror.  We were club hopping so this was just another place for us to check out.  We only stayed less than 1 hour and skipped to Cheetah's afterward.  I would say to skip it totally."
"1","I have came to Little Darlings 4 different occasions and every time I was dissatisfied. I love entertainers and the technically of dancing. Yet, this is NOT the place to enjoy it. \nCover for locals is $17 and $33 for outsiders, includes soda beverages at the bar. I have attended by myself AND with friends. We all agreed that the size of the venue was great but the atmosphere depressing. The entire night seemed unorganized. The dancers walk/stand around with scrunched mean faces and uncomfortable body language. I noticed they only smile when approaching a customer to converse. That being said 3 out of the 4 times i attended, I was never approached. Little do the women know I have $200+ for someone with good conversation and a nice smile. Oh well. \n\nI think the top 2 buzz killers for me was the DJ and the Dancers. The music ranges from rock n' roll, 80s, to hip hop. I love the variety but the transitions are horrible and the in between songs are almost annoying. The DJ's voice sounds like he is at an auction and you can never hear what he is saying 90% of the time. I am a firm believer that the DJ controls the hype and atmosphere of a club. And unfortunately I was very bored and distant.\nThe dancers are average when it comes to the skill level. They know maybe 1 or 2 pole tricks then attempt to shake their butt to their chosen tune. The majority of the dancers are beautiful in their own way.Eh, I'd say there's only 1 woman that I enjoyed watching. Jackie was here name. She was smiling and flirting and used the entire stage during her performance! She made me smile and had my eyes locked. I moved closer and threw her a big tip, she came over and thanked me. Her breast were so soft ^_^} After her performance she came over to my chair and thanked me again. I tipped her a $20 bill then released her to make more money. Its very difficult to watch the other dancers on stage without my face being twisted. They are not entertaining nor look like they enjoy their job. Smh. I can't bare to return.\n\nI would recommend going to Lacey's. Full Nude Full Bar Strip club. Thursdays 9pm-4am Fridays-Saturdays 3am-7am This is the Hip Hop strip club of Las Vegas. 21+ $20 cover charge for all. IF YOU WANT AN ENTERTAINING STRIP CLUB WITH DRINKS, BEAUTIFUL WOMEN, AND GREAT MUSIC THIS IS WHERE YOU SHOULD BE!! Not Little Darlings"
"2","Time of visit: Thursday afternoon\n\nPros: \n1. totally naked females, \n2 some of the females were very attractive and young, \n3. some of the females were very accomodating\n4. okay layout and moderate space\n\nCons:\n1. totally naked females -- some of you may  not want an ugly girls snatch 2inches from your face\n2.some of the females were very unattractive --- they weren't little...nor darling...more like...big.& gnarling...i.e.. (strectch marks..etc)\n3. some of the females were very un-acccomodating (case in point -- blue light special, 2 for 1 dance.....many of the more attractive strippers outright rejected that coupon/discount...one even tried to charge twice as much for 1...WOW....\n4. layout -- unfortunatlly..no beer/acohal\n\noverall, the cons outweighs the negative as of my recent visit.....perhaps management will read this and make corrective action to persuade the better looking strippers to honor the blue light special......if not...then its basically a bait and switch......."
"3","Great place for lunch little slow on the service side but the food is consistent quality and very good. Crunch roll and the mackerel were my favorite the seaweed salad is good too but you can't mess that one up. The box meals are pretty standard. \nThe sashimi is good quality and good size portions the best was the salmon hand roll"
"3","small limited very reasonably priced friendly employees unique speciality items but not intended for your complete shopping needs this location is steady busy with lots of parking"
"5","Trader Joes Is All That & A Bag of Pita Chips!\n\nNobody is quite the same, Sunflower is great too, and everyone loves Whole Foods but who can afford whole foods market? Not me!!\n\nTrader Joes pre-made lunches are pretty great (the ones in the deli area are the ones I am taking about)... also the cranberry sauce that they carry seasonally doesn't have fructose corn syrup or aspartame in it like everyone else's! Last but not least if you like buying cleaning products that aren't tested on animals- the sage oil and water spray \""next to godliness\"" is the bomb! It works wonders, smells good, and wasn't tested on animals- oh and cheap!!"
"4","This aint your basic grocery store. Actually, to tell you the truth, I did not really start coming here until this cookie butter craze took off. \n\nThis last visit, I was actually there to get some Mac n Cheese in the frozen food section because I have had some at somebody's house before and it was just brought up in a recent conversation (Yelp Talk strikes again!). \n\nIronically, there just happen to be some Speculoos Cookie Butter available on the shelf. Since I already had the regular cookie butter at home, I got the Cocoa Swirl this time. I was a bit surprised that there was any Speculoos at all since people pretty much grab all of them as soon as the store opens up.\n\nIf you are not in a rush, I recommend you take your time shopping here because not only will you discover new things, you will also learn that the employees here are very helpful in anything that you might be looking for.\n\nBesides your basic grocery items, you will find that TJ's carries other things that even the major grocery stores don't carry. These guys might not be the biggest stores, but they house a lot of goodies that people come here specifically for. Things like various nuts, vegetables, spices, pickled items, chips, etc. \n\nSo get on up and check this place out any time you pass by one or are in the area. Stock up on some goodies!\n\nYelp 2014 365 Review Challenge #41"
"5","Much better than ANY casino. Great food and service. The menu is fantastic. Breakfast and lunch.   Look for it just west across from Palace Station."
"3","I was attending a convention and the room was was affordable. I stayed in the courtyard and although the rooms are not up-to-date like the Tower Rooms. It was cozy, comfortable, and clean. We were close to the gym and the pool. Nothing luxurious but suit it's purpose. I did get to see the Tower Rooms and they are up to date and not that much more than the courtyard rooms. \n\nWe also ate at the buffet and the food was good and they had a variety of food available including seafood, salads, prime rib (very good), mexican, Italian, etc... The cost of the buffet was affordable except for Friday night, but it was Seafood Night. \n\nWe had breakfast at Coco's Bakery, conveniently located in the casino. The breakfast was very good (Breakfast Special included: pancakes, sausage or bacon, hash browns or hash rounds, and eggs $3.99) and prices were affordable. \n\nThe location was good on the other side of the strip, we were able to get there in 5 min. (just had to find parking). \n\nSo, if you are going to Las Vegas and need an affordable place to stay, the Palace Casino suits the bill."
"1","We were given a room at the courtyard section.  Big mistake I guess the amount you pay for is what you get.  My family and I experieced bug bites for the past two nights. Noticed one bite the first night but on the second night we all noticed more bites on are face and body.  Informed the front desk and this had to be reported to security.  They took along time. Would not stay there again."
"3","Probably the most basic of all the Station properties with the Oyster Bar being the best reason to come here. The steak restaurant is a pretty decent deal for lunch too. Cheap rooms, gambling, buffet, drinks etc. \n\nI dislike the fluorescent lighting in the poker room. It makes me feel like I am in a high school biology class. I do like the sports bettors parking spots which gives action junkies a close place to park to put in their bets.\n\nThis isn't a bad place if you're on a budget and have a vehicle but I would still opt for Fremont St if I were here on an el cheapo trip to LV."
"3","nice place not the best but def not the worst"
"3","Best way to describe this place- you get what you pay for. It wasn't a super classy or fancy joint, but it was a decent, cheap place to crash.  Can't complain too much about it.  The service was good, my room and bathroom were clean, and there was shuttling to and from the strip (if you don't mind walking a bit of distance... it only goes to the mall on the Stratosphere end of the strip) and to and from the airport. All my needs were met, thus I was content. Overall, decent hotel at a very good price (especially for such an expensive place like Vegas)."
"4","Warning:  No resort can be all things to all people and The Palace Station is NOT a good choice for many of the whiners and cry babies who post here. \n\nWe stayed in a double/double in the Courtyard for only $34.00 per night, including the resort fee which is an incredible bargain. The beds and the room were fine--no tub, but a shower large enough for two.  While the carpet in the hallway was somewhat aged, the room was only steps from the parking lot, which is rare in Las Vegas.  \n\nThe food choices were excellent, and having grown up by the Chesapeake Bay, I found their Raw Bar to be among the best I have ever visited.  The Feast Buffet was great and at $7.99pp it was as good or better than most others at two or three times the cost.   Our favorite was the Grand Cafe with its $4.99 Las Vegas Shrimp Coctail which came with 30+ smallish but delicious shrimp.  The Cafe has a number of inexpensive, but delicious entrees, and has a great breakfast.  We were very sad to find The Broiler was closed:(\n\nThe Gaming is superb, and the slots offer better odds than any of the \""Strip\"" casinos.  We found the staff and servers very helpful, quickly fixing a glitch in the Wireless Internet. Even the dealers were friendly. The Palace Station reminds one of a bygone era where one got an excellent product at an affordable price."
"2","ONLY reason why I'm here, two words OYSTER BAR. \n\nI know my friend LOVES this spot - oyster bar. cheap tables. comp'ed rooms galore. But the thing is, the casino is dingy, old, and ciggie filled I think even if they re-did the entire place it would still reek of old ciggie smells. \n\nThe rooms are tidy, neat, and clean. Yes the tables are hellva cheap and you can take turns gambling, as you're waiting in the never ending line. But it's really what you get what you pay for.\n\nThis place is off strip, on the other side of the 15 off Sahara. Close to the Asian food areas though! No need to pay for valet - their parking is right in the front of the casino/check in area."
"1","Staying in the section of the hotel that's considered the courtyard completely nasty and awful.  The smell, look, everything else made Vegas a bad experience to start but we quickly check out and paid 50 dollars a night more and stayed at the Hard Rock Casino & Hotel."
"2","If you stay here get a tower room. They are reasonably priced and fairly modern. All the other rooms are a glorified version of \""pay by the hour\"" rooms. They're dated and they stink. The sportsbook is more like a sportsbook museum. They actually still write the odds on a white board. How quaint, or sad, depending on how you look at it. Go there after 3 am and you will see the shift change strippers piling in to throw away their \""hard earned money\"". The oyster bar used to be hidden gem but now its a victim of it's own success. Long lines for food that no longer hits the mark. They must advertise in Orange County, CA because the oyster bar is always packed with asians from OC. More proof that nothing good in Vegas lasts. As far as the casino goes, its smoky and relatively low class. That begger at the corner of Sahara and the Strip you gave 50 cents to? Well, you just might meet up with them at the blackjack tables. Enjoy"
"1","Waited 40 minutes in line at the cage on a Sunday morning. There wasn't even a lot of people in line, just really slow processing. There was a gambling addiction brochure on the counter that said \""the fun stops here\"" - oh you bet the fun stopped after waiting that long!"
"4","So I am totally shocked by the poor reviews of this place.\n\nTo the people surprised by the amenity fee..  It is disclosed and that is on you for not paying attention when you booked.  (It is also waived when the rooms are comped.)\n\nTo the guy all upset because his children couldn't hang with him in line for the Oyster Bar and thought they should \""look the other way\"":  Do you know the casino is subject to an enormous fine for that?  Sorry it wasn't family friendly.   It's called a casino.\n\nThe Courtyard rooms are grossness.  Tower rooms are nice.  The employees are fantastic.  (I always wonder if people that complain about the employees without a specific customer service issue are just rude.)\n\nThis is not a 5 Star property.  It is an off strip prop which caters to locals and has cheap n clean hotel rooms in the tower.  If you'd like to run around with small children or experience the Bellagio for $30 per night while staying in the cheapest rooms possible this is not a good option."
"3","Recently I visited the front bar closest to the sports book to have a beer and the senior hispanic bartender that was working was so busy chit chatting with his fellow hispanics, I think he forgot he was at work and not at the family quinceanera. After almost ten minutes of waiting for him to catch up with what you would have thought was his family he then acknowledges me an ask me what would I like to drink. After ten minutes of watching him chit chat about irrelevant things, I changed my mind and left the casino. What horrible service! This guy obviously needs to retire if he can no longer maneuver an do what he's getting paid to do. There was nothing speedy about this Gonzales."
"2","the hotel isn't a looker but having the Oyster Bar and bingo here make it A-ok with me."
"2","So... After being excited about the decent room rate and booking the room, I came across a number of reviews that described horrible sounding conditions of the rooms, including a bed bug and roach infestation. I told my husband we were not going to even take our stuff or kids in the room until I did a thorough inspection. After quickly reading up on how to conduct a bed bug inspection (thanks Google), I checked the room thoroughly and was happy to find no signs of bed bugs or roaches. So we stayed. \n\nWould I stay again? No. After you walk through the large hotel that doesn't seem too bad, you walk back outside to the \""courtyard\"" rooms. Sounds nice, right? Nope. It feels like you're walking out of the real hotel and walking into the motel behind it. Rooms just seem very run down, a little dirty, carpets stained, etc. The beds seemed clean, which is what led us to stay, but I didn't want the kids to even take their socks off or play on the ground at all. Its a good backup, but we personally won't do it again."
"4","I like this place alot, its within walking distance from my house, loud and informal, authentic, and a blast.\n\nAnywhere you sit you are bombarded by noise, smells, glossy pictures of the food, and occassionally someone's sloppy elbow.  in a town of over inflated celebrity chef pet restaurants, a place like this fills the niche.  \n\nthe food is solid japanese counter fare, fresh seafood, great rolls, it comes out whenever.  the service is usually pretty quick and they love giving out fresh beers.  plus they serve pork belly which is a huge plus in my book.\n\ndefinately hit the spider roll, the yellowfin tartare, the pork belly and napa stir fry, and the HONEY TOAST!!..  where else can you get half a loaf of bread filled with icecream?"
"3","I really had high expectations for this place given how everyone before me raved about it. Plus I have been traveling to research dishes when I open my own izakaya restaurant. \n\nOf course, my friend and I come here after being at LAX, so we may have gotten in on the tail-end of it all. Overall, it was not bad. Seems like the type of place you go with friends to drink and be merry. Not the culinary adventure I was expecting."
"3","Not sure why it comes up as a sushi bar??? \nIts really not where I would come for sushi.\nBut....The Kushi Tan  is INCREDIBLE!!! \nAs for the Bacon wrapped Mochi I wish the bacon could have been cooked a little more the second time eating there.\nBut the Beef Carpaccio Deeeee-lish, oooh and the Garlic Bokchoy! \nand the Honey Toast Yummm I know from the pics on here it looks burnt but really it's not.\nPretty good place but you have to know where to find it too!"
"4","This rating is based on food more than service, which is fine, I'd rather have great food & so-so service\n\nIn town for yet another trade show, we ran from the strip & found this place (thanks yelpers!!)\nSmallish, cramped space, and packed! So we knew it must be good.\nThey fit us in with no res (on a Thursday), and the service was decent, not rude, but rushed & they got one thing wrong, but not major.\nThe menu is augmented with \""specials\"" on paper all over the walls. Helps if you speak Japanese I think (another good sign).\nSo we just kept ordering more after looking around, and everything was GOOD. \nThis is not your typical \""American\"" sushi joint with Calif roll/ spicy tuna roll. This is real Japanese food, some twists like Jalapeno friend rice, which we heard was good from the guy next to us.\nSo if you want GOOD, fresh, real food, this is the place.\nMaybe make a res!\nAnd there's a bakery next door that has yummy dessert.\nGo across the street for a fab foot massage to end the evening."
"3","Mochi wrapped in bacon? Asparagus wrapped in bacon?! Salmon mozzarella tempura, oh my!\n\nThis place has a lot of food that boggles your mind. Be adventurous and order off the items on the wall. This is the kind of stuff you see on Iron Chef. BUT, execution of many the dishes are far from Iron Chef caliber.\n\nOur group ordered a lot and I still don't remember everything I ate.\n\n* Deep Fried Prawns - The prawns are not the jumbo shrimp that many people are use to, but the small size everyone refers to as shrimp. Even then it wasn't deep fried enough where you can eat the entire shrimp as a whole, which left a bitter a taste because you can still taste the shell. We had a couple of pieces left over, which is a sin for our group to waste seafood! I guess it was just that bad.\n\n* Eggplant - I don't like eggplant, this dish reinforces that idea. It just came out what look like something you serve prisoners. Regardless, tried it and it wasn't good. Everyone, except one person like the dish, explaining it could have been served warmer, instead of lukewarm.\n\n* Mochi wrapped in Bacon - Bacon has a very salty taste and mochi has a weaker sweet taste. Combine both, and you get bacon taste. Really thats all there is to this, sure you get the chewy mochi texture, but the bacon just overpowers it. I might as well get a bacon skewer wrapped in bacon.\n\n* Salmon Mozzarella Tempura - We ordered this at the beginning of the meal, but didn't get it till almost the end of our meal. Great combo, but poor execution. Mozzarella or any cheese for that matter should be really melted and served as hot as possible. Thats why nachos, pizza, and burgers all have melted cheese because it just tastes better! The mozzarella tempura came to us lukewarm and almost cold. Just properly heating up the mozzarella could have made this dish a winner, but just became another forgotten dish. \n\n* Oysters w/ garlic butter sauce - Oysters was good, but felt the garlic butter sauce drowned the flavors of oysters. Maybe a little bit less garlic and a more watered down butter sauce would do it. \n\n* Salmon something w/ Salmon Caviar - This is a zensai or Japanese hors d'oeuvres. I believe it was salmon, but I could be wrong.  The caviar (fish eggs), just overpowered the rest of the zensai. Get the tar tar yellow tail instead.\n\n* Pork w/ eggs and ?? - I forgot what this was exactly, but the first time we ordered it, our pork was tough and dry. But ordering it for round 2 there is a world of difference. This bothers me a little when they can't deliver food consistently good.\n\n* Pork steaks with onions - The opposite happen with this one, it was good the first time we got it, and not so good the second time. First time it was cooked properly preserving the juices of the pork, but second time resulted in a more dry pork steak that didn't really have much flavor.\n\n* Wasabi Squid / Octupus - I don't like squid and octupus, but did give this a try. It was supringsly very refreshing. I thought I would get the kick from the wasabi, but I got a refreshing cool taste instead. I still wouldn't eat it again, but I'm sure those who love squid or octupus will love this dish.\n\n* Gyoza - Served hot for us. Very tasty and delicious. \n\n* Artichoke or Asparagus wrapped in Bacon - Wrap anything in bacon, and it'll probably taste good. This waste the case. Look mom, I'm eating my veggies... wrapped in BACON! \n\n* Beef Liver with bean sprouts and green onion - I don't really like eating liver, but this was one of the dishes that was executed very well.   It was very tender all the way through, and the bean sprouts and green onion just help balance the flavors of the liver.\n\n* Beef Carpaccio - Clean refreshing taste, that does a good job of balancing the strong beef flavors.\n\n* Black cod - Very flavorful and just cooked properly all the way through. This was reminiscent of the awesome sea bass at HK star.\n\n* Tar Tar Yellow Tail - Its just so hard for me to describe this, just order it, its good! You get 4 of them per order.\n\n* Honey Toast w/ Ice Cream - 5 pieces of honey bread toasted together, and the center burrowed out to fit the Vanilla ice cream. Simple, but awesome. We originally were given plastic utensils trying to divide it in our group, but that failed. Another waitress saw this fail, and gave us some metal utensils to slay the honey toasted dragon. It would have been nice if the first waitress gave us metal utensils to begin with. \n\nPhew that was a long list, there was more but I really can't remember them all. The wait staff was very friendly and refilled our drinks in a timely manner without asking. Other than the mishap with the Salmon Mozzarella Tempura and the plastic utensils, no complaints. The back of the house could use some work though, needing to deliver food consistently good and refine some items.\n\nIchiza is a cool hangout to try Japanese Izakaya food, but there are a couple of land mines along the way as you try to find the gems. Don't get blown up!"
"4","A friend recommended this place. Came here for dinner & it wasn't as busy as I thought it would be from reading all the other reviews. Friendly environment. The food was GOOD! I'd recommended getting the yellowtail tar tar mmm yummy to my tummy. Also had the scallop wrapped w salmon & it was actually ok. I didn't really care for the fried garlic. I'd come back to this place again when visiting vegas in the future."
"4","Konichiwa 702!!!\n\nJust came back from another fun weekend in Las Vegas.\nFlew in from LAX... and I was craving Japanese... thanks to YELP... I found Ichiza!\n\nI advise anyone in Las Vegas visiting or resident to stop by Ichiza to get your Japanese fix! Super cute spot with tons of things to choose from. Dinner here was a get find.\n\nI'm a fan of their miso soup, shrimp tempura...shrimp fried rice.\n\nCustomer service is standard... could have been better (my reason for my -1 star.) Our waiter was lagging through out our visit.\n\nBut the food is solid!\n\nIt looks like over the last couple of years, I've been posted in LV at least 3 times a year... so the next time I'm back... I'm going to get my ICHIZA fix!\n\nUpstairs at a random building. Free parking. Casual dining. Come by with friends and family!\n\nOishii!\n\nGotta love those hidden gems!\n\nArigato Ichiza!"
"2","We waited for 20 minutes to be seated.  I wish we had left.  \n\nMaybe we just didn't know what to order.  I was really overwhelmed by the menu.  I had expected it to be a traditional Japanese Sushi Restaurant offering traditional Sushi and such, but it's not.  \n\nI saw quite a few people ordered the Ichiza Ramen, so I decided to try it, too.  It was quite possibly the worst ramen I've ever had.  I don't know how to describe the flavor, or rather the lack of it.  I tried adding tons of chili powder and it just didn't work.  I barely finished 1/3 of it.  \n\nI also ordered some kind of diced tuna salad.  It came with a raw quail egg on top.  Probably my fault that I didn't read the menu carefully.  I don't eat raw egg of any kind!\n\nMy fiance's Pork Katsu was the only thing good.  It was small but I just had to steal a bite from him.  \n\nLastly was the famous Honey Toast.  One word - OVER-RATED!!!!  There was barely honey drizzled on the toast.  The ice cream was too too sweet.  If you like thick piece of toast with very sweet ice cream, this is for you.  \n\nI had such high hope for this place, but I left disappointed and hungry!"
"1","Dined at ichiza  4-5 x with a friend   late pm  after long day at   work and  one night- a  couple sitting next to our table - kid you not-  the man started putting  their dirty   plates on our table while we were eating!  I said excuse me but the rude  and uncivilized man just pretended we didnt exist and grumbled something to his wife in Korean. Immediately told manager  whats going on - but he just took plates off our table , apologized and left.  The food was okay- but i never went back after that experience"
"4","I finally decided to finish up my review for Ichiza.  My first trip consisted of trying the ramen.  Here's what I had written for that visit:\n\n\""The ramen at Ichiza isn't the best that I have had.  After visiting Monta so many times, I guess i was expecting something more flavorful.  The broth is pretty bland, although it is probably healthier than the Monta broth.  The veggies and meat were all fresh.  However, I like the noodles better at Monta as well.  This is more of an appetizer to share with friends rather than a main course meal.\""\n\nMy opinion changed after I went with a few friends, and we tried lots of stuff.  I didn't have time to record everything we ate, but I remember enjoying nearly all of it. We had a few rolls to start off with, california rolls, a sardine roll, etc.  These were pretty standard rolls, and very tasty.  We also tried a pork belly bowl, which we all thought was amazing!  It was so tender and had a perfect flavor.  The fried octopus was about the only octopus I have had that wasn't rubbery.  So many dishes, and all of them were great!  \n\nIf you haven't been to Ichiza, go with a group of friends that like to try different things, and give this place a try.  It is a local Japanese favorite, and for good reason!"
"4","We love Ichiza and go almost every time we're in Vegas.  We always order a ton of food.  Everything is always delicious, but I  love the chicken tatsuta-age and the kimchee fried rice.  It's always busy and there is often a wait, but it's definitely worth it."
"3","Yummy food for a great price,  but I wished the service was faster.  The wait for a table can be long,  and also to get the check.  Although the food was delish.  I recommend the grilled whole squid,  the grilled salmon collar, and for sure---the honey toast dessert  **a must try**"
"4","If I can take the chefs of Ichiza and open a new and bigger restaurant with trained servers, hostesses, etc... I would probably have one of the best Asian restaurants in all of Las Vegas. \n\nThe issue with Asian restaurants in general is the poor service. It can really put a damper in your dining experience. Instead of hiring experienced waitresses who can clearly understand what you're saying and be attentive throughout the meal, many Asian joints hire their nieces and/or other family members, or perhaps even random attractive Asian girls. \n\nLet's just say, Ichiza... you have phenomenal Japanese food. Authentic and not overpriced, with an extensive variety offered all over the walls and on the menu. Your ramen is definitely better than Monta's (at least that's my opinion). I will always crave your curry udon, pork and onion skewers, fresh oysters, and pretty much everything else offered in that tiny space of a restaurant ;)   But please, please, please work on the service aspect! \n\nOn the several occasions I've been to this restaurant, my group and I waited about 15+ min to be approached after seating. We watch hungry and thirsty as the 2 or 3 waitresses on duty walk by, bus tables, stare at other tables, giggle in the back, or just plain stand around. We usually have to flag someone down to inform her that we're ready to order and once we do, we feel rushed and it is rather difficult to communicate half the time. The food takes a little longer than the average Asian restaurant, which is ok... but once it's out, don't expect to see your waitress again. Or.. you will see her walking around, but she won't acknowledge your existence. Good luck on refills! \n\nLast night was a prime example. We had 4 of us in the group. We finally ordered our dishes, they came out after some time, then we had a 5th join us. Long story short, he did not have a chance to order anything at all, not even a glass of water. \n\nNeedless to say, this place has fabulous food, and it's adorable on the inside... very Japanese :). Workers are polite but lack any restaurant experience. I was torn between giving it 3 or 4 stars strictly due to service! I sure hope that aspect improves because then it would certainly be a 5 star experience all around!"
"3","This is one of those places where the food looks better than it taste.  It doesn't taste horrible, but definitely not as good as it looks.  \n\nMy favorites were the miso butterfish, kimchi fried rice and tuna sashimi salad.  It's a great place for you to try many different (small) appetizers at an efficient cost.  The vibe feels very Japanese, as if you really are in Japan, which was something I liked.  \nIt's a fun experience, but I didn't feel like it hit the spot when I walked out the door.  Probably won't come back to try different items, just my favorites."
"5","On the second floor of a strip mall off of Spring Mountain and Arville in the Chinatown area has a great Japanese restaurant called Icheza.\n\nThe restaurant is rarely slow.  That tells you that this place is doing something right!  Best time to avoid having to wait an hour or two is to come in right when they open at 4pm or really late night before they close.  On a Friday or Saturday night, even late night sometimes the place is crowded.  \n\nYou get a wide variety of people, a mix of young and old.  I have met poor college\nstudents to a CEO of a Japanese company eating at the Icheza sushi bar.\n\nThe prices are reasonable!  You can order many dishes for around $5.  Two people have a nice dinner for $40.\n\nMost of the staff are Japanese.  This helps give Icheza a unique feel of an actual Japanese restaurant in Japan.  To American standards, Icheza's dining area is small.  There is one \""sharing\"" table that seats up to 10 people, six tables for 4, two Japanese style tables where you take off your shoes that seat 8 and a sushi bar that seats 12.\n\nWith the limited seating, make sure to call in a reservation if you are planning on eating during prime time or take your chances.  Odds are, you will be waiting at least an hour.  The staff is friendly but busy.  Give Icheza a try!"
"4","I came here with one other person who turned out to be too afraid to try anything... So I didn't get to order much. This place is tapas style so it would have been better to come in a group and order a bunch of small plates everyone could share.\n\nI ordered fried baby octopus which was pretty tasty, and flying fish sashimi which was a special that night. The fish was interesting, but I think I prefer traditional sashimi after trying that.\n\nCool atmosphere, open really late, and seems pretty authentic. Just wish I could have tried more stuff."
"3","casual vegas dinner away in chinatown...upstairs plaza second floor...yakitori in izakaya fashion...beers, sake and shochu...japanese small plates dining...a pitcher of beer while browsing...standard skewers...beef tongue chewy, but not tough...hamachi kama juicy and meaty...large rolls fat for sharing...average in presentation, quality and taste...another pitcher of beer washing...wings, bacon wrapped mochi, agadashi tofu and additional skewers...standard izakaya selection...nothing memorable in presentation or taste, but cheap!...finish and back to the strip!"
"4","A part of me has an irrational distaste for Ichiza. Maybe it is the fact that they can only seat 60 people and it causes a bottleneck at the front door. The wait times can be unreasonable, but that does not detract from the food. \n\nIt has been almost three years since I have last had a chance to eat at Ichiza. Yet again, we came to see that they had almost been filled to capacity. 10 minutes later we were sat. Count it as a blessing if that is all you have to wait. The seats at the bar is perfect for two and would make for a great date spot. Although you might be inches away from the next patron, everyone is more wrapped up in their own conversation and lives. There is no need to feel self-conscious. \n\nThe buta-kimchi is similar to a spicy pork dish popular in Korea. Mixed with kimchi and served on a bed of finely shredded cabbage made for a light dish. The garlic chicken gizzard is so simple and that makes it that much better. Add a squeeze of lemon and you will roll up the lettuce garnish to eat it all. Check the specials board and print out because hidden gems are bound to make an appearance. Yesterday, they had a blue fin tuna mix with micro greens on top of half an avocado. DECADENCE! They were not done yet. Add a quail egg to it and call it a day. Don't forget to save room for dessert, because everyone needs a little honey toast in their lives. So many places try to make a name for themselves off this dish, but not many can match Ichiza. I am not a huge bread person; but butter it up, douse it in honey, and top it with ice cream and even I cannot say no."
"4","Legit Japanese restaurant in Las Vegas? Check! \n\nThey only serve small size dishes here. So you order a lot and share.\n\nTuna Sashimi Tofu Salad: I dont usually eat sashimi because I can't get passed the texture. But I decided to try it here. And it was soooo goooddd. Maybe cause it was chopped up. Maybe cause it was sooo freshh. Either way, I was thinking..\"" Where has this been all my life!!??\"" Favorite dish of the day.\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ichiza-las-vegas?select=NTV1hC0Dt5ObQon9fBg9FA#j3Vy1CPwzDo_5UWFrnkKQg\n\nSpider Roll: Portions was kinda small for a spider roll. Usually the spider rolls I get come with huge pieces of tempura and tons of crab. This one not that much. Still good though.\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ichiza-las-vegas?select=NTV1hC0Dt5ObQon9fBg9FA#AYwXJydKeIN5du8Vs7WJDQ\n\nTempura: Not greasy at all! Definite plus. And it tasted how tempura should taste!\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ichiza-las-vegas?select=NTV1hC0Dt5ObQon9fBg9FA#tLl0giRNdveYI9dvkd0DsQ\n\nCod (Butterfish): This was delicious! Buttery and full of flavor. It was super tender and just melted in your mouth! \n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ichiza-las-vegas?select=NTV1hC0Dt5ObQon9fBg9FA#NTV1hC0Dt5ObQon9fBg9FA\n\nAll I have to say is, its a little pricey for what they give. But the food is definitely fresh because you get to see all the chefs make the food for you in the kitchen."
"3","Ichiza, I wanted to love you, but you just fell a bit short.\n\nI consider agedashi tofu a benchmark dish - if the batter is filmy and stretchy, it's not quite right to me, and if the broth is overly sweet, that's a huge red flag. The batter here was stretchy, and the broth was sweet. So that was already one strike.\n\nI also didn't like any of the raw dishes here, though true izakaya restaurants don't focus as much on that, so it wasn't a huge letdown for me.\n\nThe yakitori was inconsistent. My favorite is usually kawa, but the one here didn't have the char that you need for that one to be truly delicious. The tsukune and okura were good, but the gyutan was rubbery, a big no-no for me.\n\nYellowtail collar tasted good, as did the uni (the only raw seafood dish that worked), though there was a bit of a funky aftertaste with one of the pieces of uni that we got. \n\nService was good, if a little indifferent. Good prices for Vegas, or I'd have given this even lower ratings."
"4","Where have you been all my life, Ichiza?\n\nSushi, Ramen, and anything else Japanese? In one little space? \n\nI was intimidated by the wait at first, but what started as an hour wait ended up being only 25 minutes when several other parties cancelled. And thankfully, this appears to happen A LOT. But just remember, while it's not required, reservations do come highly suggested.\n\nAs a party of four, we all went in on the menu! One friend got sushi, another got mackerel, I got Japanese-style chow mein and gyoza and the fourth friend got something that begins with \""oppa\"" (not sure how it's spelled). It's all perfect for sharing. I liked everything except the mackerel (and I don't like mackerel in the first place so the restaurant is at no fault for that).\n\nEverything on the menu is really cheap by itself, but be mindful that everything does add up really quickly. We were quite surprised by our bill at the end of the meal.\n\nOh and did I mention I loved the ambiance? Between the low tables, the backless chairs, the small space with warehouse lighting, the large crowds and the Japanese written all over the walls, I really did feel like I had just been transported to Tokyo, and not just an Asian-themed strip mall in Las Vegas.\n\nPros:\nThe ambiance\nMenu has loads of variety and very reasonable prices\nFrequent and friendly service who won't get annoyed if you add more and more to your plate\n\nCons:\nSmall space leading to (possible) long waiting times to be seated and served\nWhile each individual item is inexpensive, it can all add up really quickly if you're not paying attention\n\nReturn Factor: I'd love to"
"2","Food was decent, but the manager on duty was super shady. First, no service, we didn't get napkins or water until 20 mins later when we asked for it. At the end, I paid with cash, and waited for change, but there was less $10 bill when the manager gave us the change. When we confronted him about it, he said there might've been a mistake and he corrected it. This is just not right, some shady things going on! It is unacceptable for a restaurant to not give the right amount of change, and it seems like this manager was trying to do it on purpose!"
"4","Ichiza is always a great late-night spot to fill your cravings or to just hang out after work with a beer and some skewers. Apparently, I'm not the only one who thinks that. As a result, Ichiza is always packed, especially in the later hours. Sometimes you won't have to wait or may have a short 5-10 minute wait if you're eating alone or in a party of two (that way you can sit at the bar) but if you require a table, the wait is usually at least 30 minutes or even more. Of course, their earlier hours are less crowded, but many of the menu items (such as skewers) are not available.\n\nIchiza has been around for years and they remain pretty consistent in terms of food and service. A few times, however, my orders were forgotten or took a ridiculously long time to arrive. It can get very busy with only a few waitresses so I can see why mistakes happen.\n\nThe vibe is very authentic and is a local hotspot. There are item names posted all over the walls in both Japanese and English and sometimes you just have to wing it and see what arrives at your table. My favorites are the beef tataki, skewers (chicken gizzard and liver), grilled squid, and the tuna and tofu salad. The beef bowl is also a nice and filling item if you're hungrier. There is always hot green tea, which I love, and sometimes a little mini appetizer depending on the day and what they have.\n\nThere are so many menu items to be had so you really just have to try it yourself. It's a fun and casual dining experience with guaranteed good food that has created so many regulars over the years, myself included."
"2","Oh man so I know everyone just loves this place. \n\nWell I have been here a couple of times and usually go for the beef bowls. \n\n\nSo this time around, we decided to get more of their specialty stuff. \n\nSo we got lots of different things the pork and onions skewers, beef tongue skewers, buttered clams, hamachi sashimi, beef carpaccio, miso cod, salmon Kama. \n\n\nThe skewers were ok not as good as kyaras but ok. The clams were ok as well but a little too salty to my liking. Hamachi sashimi was good. The beef carpaccio was too oily. Miso cod was such a disappointment it was mushy very salty and just lacked the sweet flavor you usually get at other places. The salmon Kama was also salty and didn't seem cooked right.\n\nSurprisingly compared to other reviews I actually thought the service was great. They very attentive \n\nSorry maybe we went on an off night"
"5","Bomb ramen. All the other food is delicious. Always worth the wait. They can always do most specials any day. Love the atmosphere and service. Never have been let down by this place."
"3","I believed the hype and made my family come here - twice - just to make sure I liked it or not. I will say that the food is good, but I wouldn't say it was so good it was totally worth the crowds. I'm always on the lookout for places that can rival all my favorites on both coasts, but this place is probably only a 3.6 for me personally. However, if you do decide to face the crowds, please do have the coffee jello and honey toast - both are delicious (Because always dessert...)!"
"1","Received at least 38 demerits after inspection by the Southern Nevada Health District.  see the following article for details --http://vegas.eater.com/archives/2014/07/03/japanese-favorite-ichiza-shut-down-by-snhd.php"
"4","The employees and owner here are very skilled at what they do. Santiago is the best man to do tint, and the sales reps will do anything that can to help you with you custom auto needs. I do recommend!"
"1","This sucks. I am still sitting inside Villa Pizza at a dirty table waiting for my chicken wings and fries. It has now been over 40 minutes that I've been waiting and no food in sight. Plus this place is freezing.  It is 46 degrees outside and not much warmer inside, and I am sitting as far as possible from the front door. This is my first horrible restaurant experience and I'm glad I have my iPhone to draft this review. \n\nNever again!"
"1","**I'm not eating at a place where they don't practice basic food handling practice.** I paid cash for a lunch special the same person who took my money then started preparing my pizza with out washing his hands. I then asked him why didn't wash his hands first after handling money. He rolled his eyes didn't answer me and left to back. When he finally returned I asked for my money back and I left this place. Feeling bad for the people enjoying there lunch."
"4","Great place for an snack, appetizer, or meal. Perfect if you aren't sure what else is going to be open on Christmas day and you need something to tide you over since you have to wait 2 hours to be seated at Sam Woo/ or Dim Sum. \n\nPork Buns - were a good size at $1.30 a piece, coming fresh out of the oven at 11:30 am.\nChicken Pot Pies - Not really worth it unless you are craving the           great American spin- off.\nShredded Beef w/ Green Onion Roll - Only good because rolls last through the night perfect for hangover snacks. (costs more than the pork bun).\n\nHoney, I want to see your Pork Buns in Vegas, baby Vegas."
"5","I'm biased for this place. Trash talk this Chinese bakery to me and I will cut you. I love their coconut butterfly rolls, and the raisin stick is my BFF. my brother orders the bbq steamed buns, and bbq pork buns off the shelf. My mom likes her custard stick, and my sister just eats whatever's leftover in the 40.00 bag of goodies we bring home every time we make the trek to Chinatown. \n\nI love you, diamond bakery... marry me?"
"4","The raisin bread and taro pastry were both very very tasty."
"2","Disappointing Chinese bakery. The baked goods are freshly baked right out of the oven but don't taste that great. The bread was tough and other items did not look too appetizing; like the cracked egg tarts. The ladies behind the counter could care less about their customers. They just chatter away without paying any attention to you.  It's much better in SF."
"3","I came in hoping some egg tarts might be there, but of course that is always out first. The BF and I just grabbed some snacks for later.\n\nThe loot:\n\nGreen onion roll with pork sung- this was okay. The bread and sung was good, but I can barely get the green onion flavor. Thats really what I love normally about this is that strong flavor blend of the sweet bread, salty pork and savory onions....but it was missing part of the trifecta. \n\nSteamed Chicken Bun- pretty good. I would get it again if I'm in the area, but I would say it's pretty standard. It's just as good as the ones I got at the deli in the supermarket (168 has them in 4 packs). \n\nGreen Tea bread- the bread was good and the flavor seemed good but the swirls of green tea paste in the bread was really goopy, slimy almost so I didn't enjoy much of it. \n\nBF got pineapple bun and he ate it up so it must have been good. Honey crisps- still have it left over...a bit too oily. \n\nThe skinny is that this place is A-OK. I wouldn't go out of my way for it, but I'll come back for certain items when I'm in the area and to try to get some of these egg tarts."
"2","I judge Asian bakeries on their Pineapple Bun. And Diamond Bakery doesn't add up to buns I've had in LA (unfair comparison, I know) or even to buns you can find at 168 Market. I tried a while host of other buns and pastries, but The only thing I've had here that I enjoyed are the Steamed Pork Bun. Get them while they're hot, though."
"3","The Skinny: great when you get here around 10:20 am when stuff is fresh from the oven... otherwise you might have a lot less things to choose from (3.75), service: good - if you don't see something, ask the ladies and they'll find it for you in the back (3), value: pricey but will satisfy your Asian bakery fix (3)\n\nThe first couple of times I came here, I wasn't really impressed. The counters were pretty bare in the afternoon and I walked out empty handed.\n\nThen, for whatever reason, we stopped by this place at 10:20 am. I was shocked. They had Portuguese Egg Tarts (a Macau specialty - egg tarts with a golden brown topping from the extra sugar), Curry beef puffs, butter pan loaves, Taiwanese type sammys, rice dumplings. It was like a completely different store.\n\nThe Portuguese Egg Tarts are okay. I find the filling to be nice, but there are problems with the pastry. Not quite the shortbread crust, it's kind of a hybrid of between the flaky and cookie crust.\n\nThe curry beef puff is good. The puff pastry is flaky and light while the curried beef is flavourful. The bbq pork puff pastry was ok due to the lackluster bbq pork filling.\n\nIf baked buns are your thing, there is a caveat. I would say that the bun is a little on the drier side - okay when fresh but isn't that good the next day. For the buns without filling (ie, pineapple buns), you might find yourself a little disappointed. That being said, if you are a filling kind of person, you'll love this bakery because of the copious amounts of filling in their red bean and lotus paste buns. \n\nThe steamed buns are great and hold up better (I've refrigerated them and resteamed them the next day and it's good.). Fav are the red bean steamed bun - lots of filling, nice lighter texture than what you normally see.\n\nI really love their butter pan loaf (I'm not talking about the butter pan buns... see the pic here because I have no idea what they really call it in English: http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q ). I got addicted to this brioche-like bread in Hong Kong from their famous Maxim's bakery. Although Diamond's cannot compare to Maxim's, it still is pretty good. Buttery and lighter than their regular bread, it iswonderful toasted with a little butter/jam.\n\nWith some great things items, this is my \""go to\"" place when I've a hankering for some Chinese bakery if I can get here when the bread comes out of the oven (10:20am)."
"3","This place is ok, as my rating says. I come here for the lemon horns. They run out relatively quickly so get here early. The pastry is flaky and the filling is just as a lemon filling should taste - sweet yet acidic. The cakes are ok but not too impressive. They had a recent renovation which seemed useless. I'm sure there are better in Chinatown. The only reason this one is frequented so often is because of its location next to the 99 Ranch Market."
"3","Came here to pick up a cake for a birthday. First thing i saw was the egg custard. After that I didnt care much for the cake. All i wanted was that egg custard. Anyways this place is good. Line wasnt bad when getting the cake. PIcked up the cake around noon. It wasnt busy at all. Wouldve liked it if i went in here when they have all the stuff just out of the oven! That would have been the best. I wouldve gotten 1 of each if i had enough money that time. There were a lot of stuff i wanted to get but i didnt have time. Like i said, only thing i wanted was that egg custard!! I dont think i got a taste of that cake during the birthday party"
"2","I come from socal and this place would never survive there.  Nonetheless, this is the only place that I could find decent sponge cake in vegas, and their pineapple custard buns are REALLY good.  The zong zi are bleh (filled with green bean, egg yolk and pork, but not much of any of those things) and not very fresh (we asked about the red bean zong zi and the lady that worked there actually told us not to buy it because it was really old).  The egg custard tars are also really tiny.  The steamed red bean buns are really really good though, and did I mention already that the pineapple custard buns are absolutely DELICIOUS?  \n\nAlso, be sure to come in here early to get the full selection - we went at around 3 in the afternoon twice, and all they had left was sponge cake and egg custard tarts."
"1","Warning!!! this place recycles rice and food. To my dismay, I observed the waiters pick out some rice parts from the rice bowls and then top it off. Later I saw one table had a leftover, they took it to the back, while they bussed the table and threw everything else away...hmm I wonder who they will serve that to!\nAvoid pork and clams, their meat is half rotted!!!\nRoast pork and duck taste ok.\nAlso they do not take credit cards. Just avoid this place."
"1","I wouldn't even give this place a star if it was possible. My family came here for dinner. We ordered deep fried tofu, half a duck, and salty fish fried rice. \n\nThe half duck didn't include any breast meat. It only included the worst parts of the duck. We complained to management, but they didn't seem to care and walked away. I'll upload an image of the bones. Duck breast meat bones are flat and long. \n\nThe fish fried rice did not actually include any fish. \n\nThe deep fried tofu was bland and uninteresting. \n\nIt was one of those, \""wow, these people really suck at their job\"" moments and one of the worst dining experiences of my life."
"2","Overpriced food here. The duck was OK, but i wish the skin should be crispy instead soft skin."
"3","We were in China Town Plaza wanting to grab a quick lunch but our little one wanted noodles. It was between this place and Harbor Palace.\n\nWe ordered the wonton noodles and dry beef chow fun.\nThe dishes were your typical decent Chinese food but I felt it wasn't worth the price we paid. Pretty much all the dishes here were overpriced and they didn't even have some sort of lunch menu/specials. \n\nI have to admit, the service was pretty decent but I think we'll stick to our usual Chinese restaurant, KJ Kitchen. \n\nP.S. Most of the restaurant near China Town areas are CASH ONLY. So, be sure to bring some cash..."
"1","Date/Time:  Saturday - 7:30pm\nOccasion:  Dinner with daddy and little brother\nParty of:  Three\nLocation:  Typical Chinese restaurant. Simple decor. Not the cleanest\nOrdered:  Westlake Beef Soup, Flamebroiled Pepper-Beef Steak, Ginger Chicken, and Seafood-Tofu claypot\nTotal incl gratuity: ~$\n\nExpensive.  Definitely gone down-hill.  And quite simply put, not worth it.  The only thing worth mentioning was the soup.  The pepper beef steak was sliced way too large and quite difficult to chew.  The ginger chicken was terribly dry.  And I wasn't interested in taking another bite of the seafood tofu claypot.\n\nTo top it off, each entree ran $12 - $18.  $60 for four entrees at a Chinese restaurant?? Definitely not worth it it!  I've typically gone here for lunch and ordered noodles.  Now I'm scared and likely not to return.  I'm going to stick with pho in Chinatown from now on.  Fellow yelpers: any suggestions on other better Chinese restaurants in the area? ;)"
"3","Food - 5 stars \nDelicious Chinese food. We ordered so much food for five people: \n- Seafood chow mein - Good flavor and lots of seafood.\n- Seafood soup - Very gingery if you don't like the flavor. \n- BBQ pork - From what I was told, most of the pieces were fatty. Dish was small for $10. \n- Tofu bowl with seafood, chicken, and veggies - Okay dish.\n- Mixed veggies with fungus and various mushroom - Yum! This was delicious. \n\nPrices were a bit higher than what we're used to back in the Bay Area. \n\nWatch your food. Our dishes has plastic and foil pieces. \n\nCleanliness - 1 stars\nCheck your utensils for leftover food. Tables were also not wiped down very well. Lastly, the floor had lots of napkins, chopsticks, and food. I can't believe this restaurant received an A grade! \n\nService - 2 stars \nEven from the beginning of the experience, service was not great. The person at the front pointed to our table and gave us our menus. We also had to ask our waiter for so many items - rice, clean utensils, and our bill. \n\nOverall, good food, but that is all."
"2","I remember coming to this location with my family every time we were in Vegas. I wanted something cheap and delicious. I found the latter! \n\nOrdered the: \n* 1/2 Roasted Duck - It was actually quite good here but my boyfriend commented on the small portions compared to Cali Sam Woos. \n* BBQ Pork & Chicken Rice - Ahh tasted just like home\n* Veggies (suggested seasonal veggies) - simply saut\u00e9ed with some garlic & salt. Srzly can't go wrong. \n\nIt was quite expensive here though - bill came out to be around $50 or so. I mean sure we ate for 3 MORE meals but....\nAND it's cash only. \n\nI think I'm going to try Capital Seafood upstairs next time."
"2","Service and cleanliness and such were okay, but the food was mediocre compared to other places in town and it was expensive for the low quality and taste they offer. Their BBQ to go for the duck and pork are much better, but this isn't a good dine in place."
"1","This is one of the worse restaurants ever! I must admit their food is somewhat delcious but the service is a big FAT F! My freinds and I decided to dine in late one night. We ordered and as usual these waiters in chinese restaurants are rude which we just ignored. As our order was put in they waiter comes back with our BILL, he stated \"" the cashier is leaving and they were ready to close the register\"". We did not even receive our food and they were already throwing the bill at us. I thoguht that was flat our rude!! even thou the food was good we were not doing to deal with this we got up and left the table! I would not reccomend this place at all! they were closed before for a horrible food inspection grade of F. Your better off eating at panda express!"
"1","I used to come here with the family every year whenever we were in Vegas. Saying that I went here a week ago and the quality has completely gone down the drain. I ordered the juk (rice porridge) with duck egg and pork. It was so watery and tasteless. Barely any pork or egg. Tasted like water. Then got the won ton soup with noodles. Again soup was just water. The won tons themselves tasted like they made them yesterday and just reheated them so they were chewy. I won't be coming back here. I guess I will have to find another chinese place if I'm craving good chinese food while I'm in Vegas."
"1","After 5 hours of nonstop driving from SD to Las Vegas, the fam decided to stop by the \""asian\"" area and get some food before we checked in at our hotel. Bad choice.\n\nWhen you first walk in, you are greeted with a wall of awards, recognitions, and accolades from websites and critics. I've been to a Sam Woo BBQ before, and this was uncommon. I thought it would lead to a good start, I was wrong.\n\nThose awards were issued in 2001, and boy, did they really change the restaurant till now. I ordered the roast pork and roast duck rice dish. Just to let you know, the prices for the food served here are double the price if the Sam Woo back in SD ($7-$10, Las Vegas Sam Woo $7-$20). Came pretty fast. The duck was OK, but the pork was really fatty. In fact, it was almost ALL fat. Not too good.\n\nMy dad, on the other hand, ordered the Singapore noodles. While we were eating our food and finishing up, his food hasnt even left the kitchen yet. We asked if they forgot his order, and one of the waiters jus rudely replied:\n\n\""Its coming out, wait.\""\n\nAfter 10 minutes we asked again. Turned out they JUST started the order the second time we asked. The waiter didnt even acknowledge the chefs in the kitchen to see if they started. The food came, but the service spoke for itself already.\n\nNO GOOD."
"1","I've been to this Sam Woo several times in the past and it was alright, but when I went last week, it was NASTY.  The quality has definitely gone way down.  The crab soup was bland.  The beef chow fun was too salty from being drenched in soy sauce.  The fried rice and chow mein was okay but not that good.  We also had a mushroom claypot dish that was actually decent and it was the only dish that was hot.  We had a lot of leftover food and I was not full because I didn't like the food.\n\nThis place is dirty and the service is slow.  My teacup had a crack in it which made my tea leak.  Their highchairs were filthy.\n\nThis place is ridiculously overpriced.\n\nThis place doesn't deserve to be called Sam Woo because they make the chain look bad.\n\nOh, and it is cash only."
"1","Bad service and nothing special about it..\n\nCompared to other Sam Woo branch seriously, this branch doesn't really serve a good food.. \n\nNot a good value.. Don't waste your time and money here, especially if you're familiar with Sam Woo BBQ restaurants."
"3","This place keeps getting pricier every single time I came to Vegas.  Furthermore, I felt that this place has gone downhill.  The duck is not as good as it used to be.  But Sam Woo is still Sam Woo.  The food in general is not bad in my opinion.  Just reserve this place for the late night."
"1","Very expensive tourist trap. The food is pure crap."
"2","For a change of scenery or you simply are sick of all-you-can-eat buffets, I would suggest this place. Just know that, like all other Asian restaurants, you are going to get terrible terrible service. The staff will act like they are doing you a favor by feeding you. The food at other Sam Woo's restaurants in Southern California is much better."
"2","This place could use more help and workers to really clean the place up and bus tables.  There was only one bus boy and two waiters for such a big place.  The food was barely ok, portion was small as well, not worth the price.  We will not come back there.  It is ridiculous for such a big name as Sam Woo restaurant chain."
"1","Be careful when you eat in this restaurant I was order ong choy it has grass in side the food they gave me an other plate the second plate it has more grass then the first plate .and the price so expensive , never again and i recommend don't go to this place ."
"1","If you want hepatitis this is a place where you can get it! Totally disgusting from the food to the restaurant and the waiters. This whole place should be bombed with RAID!"
"1","Food: Mediocre\nService: non-existence \nPrice: over-priced\nCleanness: I wonder why this place is still open.\nOverall rating: 0.5 star"
"1","Out of Business. Building has been vacant for a couple years. Will be torn down as part of the freeway expansion."
"1","It is with great disappointment that I am writing to report my dissatisfaction with \""Soon\"", the proprietor of SPARKLE CLEANERS. For over 5 years, I have been taking the extra driving risk required to visit this location and take the quickest shortcut around the backstreets behind this block to head east on Sahara (otherwise one has to go over the 15 freeway before being able to U-turn from west to east.) This is NOT a convenient location from a driving risk standpoint.\n\nIt was on the advice of a friend when I first tried the cleaners and was well pleased when 75% of the time spots were successfully removed without a trace. This was magic and I kept coming back and referring  friends despite the additional cost. Okay, in 5 years I have only lost one item which may not be enough to be complaining about. But I think I need to tell the whole story so here goes:\n\nPatiently, I returned week after week to pick up my favorite white blouse (valued at $400 from Anne Fontaine at the Forum). She shook her head and said that it was not ready and that I should come back in another week. This went on for FOUR weeks. Finally, I received the blouse with her complaining about how much work it was to iron the sash. Well, that is what I thought I was paying for! Nothing but smiles from me; someone else had done the ironing while I did the driving and driving and driving...\n\nBiggest complaint:  when you drop off a valued item and expect that it will be rightfully returned, you do NOT want it to be implied that YOU are in error. This is the SECOND time that I met with great resistance when informing Soon of a mistake. The first time, it was with my other favorite white blouse valued at $200 from Saks. Soon tried to give me someone else's cheap white shirt instead. She insisted that it was mine. Politely, I pleaded with her that mine was different. She did not want to believe that it was a mistake, but I refused to take someone else's garment instead of my own. Weeks later, she called and apologized she had found mine. This was a relief. I honestly thought I had lost the garment. I continued to trust Soon.\n\nThis last and final time is the biggest disappointment because it resulted in the loss of a family heirloom. I took 12 blankets and quilts in for cleaning. I was very anxious over the fact that she was too busy to write a proper ticket for the items and instead she quickly took them from me and stuffed them all into plastic bags. I requested that she write a ticket, but she gestured for me to leave and that she had it under control. Against my better judgment, I allowed her too-busy demeaner to intimidate me. I left with a bad feeling. There was no indication of cleaning costs either. \n\nYou can guess what happened. I am given back only 11 of the items and charged a bill of $200 for cleaning these quilts, afghans, and wool blankets! Granted, this was an unusual cleaning order. I really should have been told what to expect. Worst yet, when I got home I realized that the most valuable wool heirloom blanket was MISSING. So I called immediately to let Soon know. She repeatedly insisted that I was mistaken (just as she did with the white blouse she later found) and that there were no other blankets in for cleaning but mine and that I had received them all. Now, I feel like a fool for continuing to allow myself to be treated this way. Even if there is a risk of property loss, I should not have to be treated without respect as a long-time loyal customer. Would you?"
"1","I came to this cleaners for a bridesmaid dress to be altered and I was extremely happy with it.  Since I live close by I figured I would try the Dry Cleaning side of.  I will NEVER EVER come back to this place again.  I feel like I was totally ripped off.  \n\nI dropped my clothes off on a Thursday and she said to pick them up on Tuesday.  (Open all weekend so why so long).  I came in today Tuesday at 4pm.  She told me they JUST STARTED working on my items and she would call me when they would be ready.  1 hour later she said they were ready.  I picked them up, took them home and this is when I get heated.  \n\nMy Herve Leger dress I dropped off was the only thing that looked cleaned.  I had black shoe polish stains on it from an event I had attended and lucky for me they came out and the dress looked brand new.  I made such a stink about this dress to the older Asian lady at the front of the store, she knew I was going to make sure this dress was spotless when I came back.  All my other shirts still had water stains on them and they looked dirty still.  It looked like all my other items were just pressed so they looked like they were treated.  I think they ran out of time and got lazy and so they cleaned the Herve Leger dress and just pressed the other items to save time and to rip me off! I called as soon as I got home and noticed all of this and the same lady played dumb with me.  She said I could come back the next day and they would fix it but as I told her before, I was going out of the country and needed these items.  She then said to bring them in when I get back and they will correct the issue but to be honest, after reading others reviews on this place, I do not trust Sparkle Cleaners.  I'll take a loss on this and go back to my other dry cleaners across town.   Save yourself the trouble people!!"
"1","If I could give this place and its employees zero stars I would have. \n\nI had pretty much the same experience as the other reviewers here. Unbelievably long waits (although the waiting room had a max of 8 people in it). Rude and dismissive nurses and employees, and I couldn't find a trash can or box of tissues to save my life! I was in Vegas on vacation with my father and had the unfortunate experience of getting a severe case of food poisoning. I was already scared since I was in a strange city and in a lot of pain. I know that waiting is to be expected in ERs but the kind of rude treatment that I received by a couple of the nurses was simply inexcusable (and I am a very patient and low-maintenance patient typically). There was one nurse named Lori that was an angel, and the student doctor that was there was not too bad either, but the majority of the staff were simply lounging around chatting and didn't want to be disturbed by a paying patient who was suffering and scared. All I can say is- pray that you never get sick in Vegas and if you do, go ANYWHERE but UMC."
"1","This is most undoubtably, the worst hospital in the Las Vegas valley. \nParking is always a nightmare, a vast majority of the staff is rude and show no care or compassion, Attending Physicians hardly communicate with each other or their Residents/RN's etc, parts of the hospital lack serious house-keeping, food in the cafeteria is never anything more than lukewarm, emergency room nurses are rude and condescending, it's far too easy to gain access to any part of the campus.\n\nMy list goes on for DAY'S! Do NOT go to UMC. There are 20+ other hospitals that I'd rather spend my $1000's of dollars at."
"2","Went here for pneumonia. Emergency room dirty and packed. Horrible reception staff. Nurses in ER especially Erin was awesome. Went into IMC/ICU for pneumonia and empyema. Docs inserted a chest tube. Which they did not drain enough and ended up hospitalized again 2 weeks later with a new chest tube at mike o Callaghan hospital (horrible ER awesome ICU care and specialized docs/pulmonoligist). UMC ICU had the worst CNA's (Sally was the worst no respect and careless) and nurses (1 good nurse Teresita she helped when she was assigned to me). They were rude. Esp the fact most were Filipino nurses. I am Filipino and my wife is white as snow. They did not treat her with any respect.  Careless and no care for the pain I was in.\nRude, dirty, bad care, bad doctors on decisions to discharge patients when not fully recovered. \nHopefully new president fixes the patient care here."
"1","Very unprofessional. They have unclear and unprofressional business policies. Did not accept company check from another tow yard, was not told this untill we made the 5 hour drive to pick up a vehicle. Office personell are very unhelpful. When our business owner called to talk to a supervisor they said it is business policy that no one can speak to a supervisor. Horrible business."
"1","TERRIBLE TERRIBLE SERVICE!!!!!! \n\nI understand no one will be happy to get their car towed, but this place is a joke. \n\nI was also one of the victims at Firefly (separate night from the previous review..)  15 of us got towed at Firefly, when there was only 2 8.5x11 signs on a light pole outside of an abounded building, NOT near the parking.   I was parked in a spot labeled \""Visitor\"".  If this many cars are getting towed everyday, that says something about their communication about parking there. \n\nThis place only takes cash (so they can probably pay a chunk to whoever else is part of the parking scam at Firefly..) and they charge $7 ATM fee.  \n\nMy license was in my car, in my purse, and they wont let you go to the lot to get it, someone brings it out to you. \n\nThe manager at this place told me Firefly has been doing this for months.  And that Firefly wont pay to use those parking spots, so the owner of the empty building next door tows the cars every night. \n\nI finally get my car-- IT HAS A BLUE SCRATCH ON IT!!!  It is about one square foot that was NOT there the night before. They had me fill out a piece of paper and said the \""claim team\"" will contact me... . it does no seem promising..I am still waiting for that call. \n\nI mean what tow company will pass up the experience to tow cars, but this place is SHADY!!"
"3","I have been here two times. It's not a bad place. Atmosphere is very nice. Waitress was friendly. Food was not bad, pretty average. If I am in the mood for simple Korean food,  would come to this place."
"2","I dined here with a friend yesterday and the first thing that drew us in was the happy hour special. We were able to choose 2 different types of Korean BBQ, a soup, and a beer or soju for just about $26. This is a great deal when it comes to Korean BBQ. The portions were ideal for 2 people. Most of the waitresses were friendly and helpful; however, we had one girl as our main waitress and she was not attentive and awfully rude. She left the bulgogi (Korean marinated beef) on the stove too long and it almost burned, so I had to flip them over, cut the meat, and distribute myself. Anytime we asked her for something, she seemed angry and frustrated. We said \""thank you\"" for everything she brought over (with extreme delay I might add), and I never heard her once say \""you're welcome\"". She spoke fluent English, so I knew that wasn't the issue. Also, the food... I guess coming from the NYC area I am extremely biased; however, I was rather disappointed. The food wasn't bad, but it was nowhere near my expectations. The bulgogi was in large pieces and not juicy and the pork bulgogi was not spicy (pork bulgogi is supposed to be a spicy, flavorful dish). The side dishes were the most disappointing part. Usually, in Korean BBQ houses, you receive a bunch of side dishes to compliment your meal. Korean Garden BBQ House only gives about 4. So overall, I most likely will not be returning and if you've ever had great Korean BBQ, I do not recommend this place. My search for a 5-star Korean restaurant in Vegas continues.."
"1","Had the Beef Bulgogi box and ordered sides of the kimchi.   WORSE BULGOGI I HAVE EVER EATEN.  Dry and no taste.  VERY VERY VERY Disappointed.  Will never eat here again"
"4","We went here on a saturday night with a group of 5 people for the AYCE, and quite enjoyed our experience.\n\nThe food was great; I definitely prefer their sides to Tofu Huts, though I still like Honey  Pig's Kim chi and pickles better. I did miss beef tongue, which they do not seem to have. Sad face. \n\nIt may be due to where our table was; directly along the wait staff's path to the kitchen, or due to the fact that we ate pretty late at night and the restaurant wasn't packed, but we didn't seem to have the service problems a lot of other yelpers encountered. \n\nPros:\n- Great food, lots of different sides. My favorite bean paste stuff I've had in Vegas.\n- You'll have infinitely better luck getting in here than at Tofu Hut. Also, more parking.\n- Quite affordable for the amount and quality of meat. Much nicer meat cuts than tofu hut.\n- Incongruous and lovably campy tiki party atmosphere! Korean Dramas on TV!\n\nCons:\n- No beef tongue! \n- Service can be a bit on the slow side. Wasn't super bad, but we did have to ask and wait for water a few times. This seemed to stem from staff being busy, and they were super friendly."
"4","Great place to eat! Not only is the food great but the service is also great! I have a hard time finding great service in Asian restaurants. They came around regularly and we didn't feel like they were ignoring us. They also came around and helped with the BBQ from time to time. Their spicy squid and beef tofu soup were a little spicier than I would have liked them to be. I'm not a big fan of this mashed potato side dish they have. I'm definitely a big fan of beef tongue, squid, brisket, Kim chi, and bulgogi."
"3","Came here on a recommendation of a friend, and for a bachelor party, and let me tell you I wasn't disappointed! \n The gals are friendly and not pushy. Bottle service is a good way to go. \n And the funny thing was they weren't gonna let me in since I was wearing a wifebeater, but they let me buy one of their t-shirts($20) to put over it, and they let us all in for free!!!\n And all the gals are pretty attractive."
"1","Okay, so my husband wanted to go here since he'd heard of it. Big, big mistake. If could give them 0 stars I would. \n\nFirst, DO NOT take a taxi to get there. They charge you $30 per person if you do, because they have to pay off the taxi driver. So don't expect the $10 price advertised on their website. And don't forget the 2 drink minimum per person, and drinks are $15 each. \n\nSecond, it's not nearly as nice as I expected it to be. The reputation is as a high class strip club, but in reality it's very trashy. The girls were so-so, nothing special. None of them really made use of the poles. If you want a good pole dance show, try Cirque du Soleil instead. \n\nI highly, highly recommend against going there.  Definitely not the kind of place where a woman can go with her husband comfortably."
"1","Friendly bouncers (not a good thing).  Unattractive women.  STANK.\n\nWhatever you do, do NOT come to Cheetah's for a good time.  You're not gonna find it here.\n\nWe were dropped off by a shuttle on our second stop for the night.  I'm not sure exactly what time it was, maybe 3am on a Saturday night.  The first thing that I noticed when walking in was that the bouncers were COOL.  As in smiling and friendly.  That totally threw me off.  It couldn't have been a good sign.\n\nWe walked in (no cover, I would have been PISSED if we had to pay), and it STANK.  Like cigarettes and ass and no attempt at covering up with perfume.  They seriously need to have their ventilation system worked on if they even have one.  If there is any kind of CFM air change code requirements, this place isn't meeting them.  We sat down, and there were only maybe 5 girls working, and no one on stage.  Yes, I realize it was late.  But it was a SATURDAY NIGHT IN VEGAS!!  The girls were pretty nasty looking, and I was DRUNK!  Can't get much sadder than that.  We stayed maybe 10-15 minutes before I was able to get ahold of a cabbie I met to save us from this shithole.  \n\nI have heard of Cheetah's, but whatever magic there may have once been here has crawled into a corner and died with a lit cigarette in its mouth.  I will never be back for any reason.  Stay away!"
"2","Cool layout big bar! But the girls? Alot of them look like there on drugs. I say they ranged from zeros to a couple of 5s. Sad to say watching the customers was more amusing than watching the girls. Not only were they not cute, but their dancing was WACK. the dj played pretty good music tho. Drinks were weak. I left without a lap dance. Need I say more?"
"5","Will always remain one of my 'to go' places when passing through vegas."
"2","I was very excited to check this place out, it had been written up as one of the classic/oldest steak houses in Vegas so my co-workers and I went in with great expectations. \nWhen we arrived the dinning room was almost completely empty, the hostess was very sweet and set us up in a nice booth. This is where things started falling apart, it comes down to just crappy service. The waiters, dressed in tuxes gathered in a group outside the kitchen and showed little to no interest in providing any level of service. When a waiter did show up to take my coworkers drink order my coworker  asked if they had any IPA's to which the waiter said  that they had Heineken my coworker pointed out that this was not an IPA which the waiter then disputed. I asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored I went to the hostess and got one myself. I can't say enough about how bad the service was I'm pretty easy going but I was pissed my the time we were done eating. The food was good which is why I'm giving them 2 stars otherwise it would be one star. \nWhen we were leaving  we told the hostess of our dissatisfaction and she took down our emails and assured us that we'd be taken care of and would receive some sort of compensation, over a week later this hasn't happened."
"3","This is not the same restaurant of past years.  Been eating at the Golden Steer since the early 1970's and the service and food was outstanding.  Going down hill since the 2000's.  Will not eat there any more.  Not worth the value.  Staff was very friendly and they decor has not changed.  I ordered a NY Strip steak and they butterflied it and took all the flavor out it.  We used to brag about his place to all we know who were traveling to Las Vegas, no more."
"4","Definitely an old school steak house and I say that in a good way!  I haven't been here since the 80s when we came here as tourists.  \n\nA friend and I went here to enjoy a tasty steak, and that's just what we did.  Since we were there early, we had run of the place.  We took photos of the different booths where Sinatra, Elvis, Sammy Davis, Jr. and Dean Martin dined.  The hostess showed us a side room where she said Tony Spilotro would dine and she had a story about a counter where their guns were placed before they sat down.  When she said that he was there only a month before his body was found in the desert (after he was murdered, he was buried in a field in Indiana), it cast a little doubt on the authenticity of her story.  Enough of that, on to the meal.\n\nWe both ordered the 12 ounce filet that their menu refers to as \""the Aristocrat of Tenderness).  I ordered a chopped green salad with Roquefort dressing.  I got the jumbo baked potato that the menu bills as \""Vegas' biggest.\""  Finally, we each had some chocolate cake for dessert.\n\nThe bread basket was simply some sliced Italian bread--nothing special.  The steaks were wonderful.  Mine was very tender.  I ordered it back and blue and that's almost the way I got it.  It was done a bit more than I prefer.  My friend ordered his well done--he's a Brit--go figure, but he enjoyed his steak, too!\n\nI only got butter with the baked potato and it was swimming in butter.  It was excellent!  My friend got fries which he described as chips as good as you can get in the States and as good as what he gets at home.\n\nWe both ordered the chocolate cake.  This was a bit of a disappointment.  It was a bit dry and a bit small.  There was no dollop of whipped cream to dress it up.  \n\nService was great.  Our server has been with the Golden Steer for years, and he was on top of everything.  Very nice dining experience in a classic Las Vegas steakhouse that has been around for years and years."
"1","From the moment I waked into this place I was made to feel like I did not belong. Even with a reservation, they made me feel as though I was not welcomed. Rude host staff and bartender who seemed to truly careless about anybody other than some fat cat sitting on the end of the bar. \n\nOh, well, on to my seat, and this is where the fun begins. I should have trusted my gut instinct immediately upon entering the restaurant and gone someplace else, btu I was hoping the food would redeem the poor service.\n\nI was sooo wrong. \n\nThe food here was not what I expected for the price. My steak was tough, filled with tendon and not cooked properly, Escargot was amazingly bland, and sides had a \""pre-packaged\"" taste/quality I could not get past. On top of the \""okay\"" food, the service was disgusting. I dined alone, and was not pinching pennies; I wanted to spoil myself. At the end of the meal my server asked me if I had a coupon! This was beyond outrageous and I can venture a guess at to why he targeted me as a possible \""coupon carrying\"" person. I paid cash, no coupon, and vowed to never return to this place that clearly is use to, and wants to, cater only to the \""Good Ol' Boys\"". They should really be ashamed."
"2","While the steak and table side Cesar Salad was perfection, NOTHING else at this restaurant was even close to acceptable.  From the moment we arrived, until we left, our service was simply HORRIBLE. First, at the hostess stand the hostess stood glaring at her computer screen as we stood waiting to be acknowledged. Never did acknowledge us, so we turned around and went to the bar. 2 cocktails (a beer and a wine) 17 bucks, gave the older man bartender a 20 and he NEVER CAME BACK WITH OUR CHANGE! The assumption that, that was his tip was rude and in very bad service and bad form. Of course he was going to get that as his tip, but to assume. BAD!  VERY BAD. Its stealing! And if he \""forgot\"" even worse, he shouldn't be working at such a restaurant as the Golden Steer.  So we went back to the stand and the \""harried\"" hostess was able to accommodate our reservation, clueless as to our earlier \""encounter\"".  The food service was slow, wreck-less (no refills of anything: water, bread, butter, coffee, or up-sell cocktails!), and the removal of dirty plates never happened. We stacked our plates to get them out of our way after sitting empty in front of us for 15 minutes. \nThe Prime aged 20 oz. T Bone was very good, as was the Cesar Salad. AS FOR the desert - forget it!! I wanted REAL NY cheesecake: I got Sara Lee...Im almost positive; NOT restaurant QUALITY in the least.  Coffee arrived bitter, luke warm, and no refills were offered. \nIn closing, Id skip Golden Steer. There are wayyyyy too many fine steak house in Vegas to be bothered with this dinosaur."
"2","Met friends from out of state that we wanted to please. Had eaten here before and were delighted. Can not say the same about tonight. Met at the bar brought to our table, forgot to give menus which was not so terrible. Took another 30 minutes if not more before a waiter decided to come over. My glass of water was not replenished once throughout the meal. The waiter put on his best de Niro game face and tried to make light of the situation. But when diners are spending the kind of money we spent or would have spent more the service should have been top notch instead we were treated like this was steak and ale. Will not be back."
"3","Jay, gave me the worst service, ever! He reached across a couple of our guests to serve drinks and when he finally got around to taking our dinner order, at his leisure. All of our drinks were empty, and that didn't seem to bother him either. And amidst him taking the time out of his busy schedule to take our order( with 3 other tables in the place), he proceeds to tap his hand on his crossed arms. One of our group mentioned that we must have pissed off the waiter.  Steaks, tough! Feel free to check out my other reviews. I am never negative about restaurants, but this one took the cake. The only reason it was given 3 stars was because of the atmosphere. So if tou dont care about the food being good, or the service being worth a darn, well this is your kind of place!!"
"1","Don't know how this chain stays in business. The food they put out is under par and when you bring it to their attention its hilarious to see the look on their face. It just comes from poor or no management.  2 people here and half the table are dirty."
"4","The omelets are HUGE!! If I'd known this I probably would have gotten the \""baby\"" size which I'm sure is still gigantic.\nI had the popeye omelette which has spinach, mushrooms, jack cheese, and I added bacon. Then they give you the option of pumpkin bread or toast. I had the pumpkin bread which came out first, steaming hot with a side of butter. very good! Overall, this place is a fun breakfast spot to check out. Kinda hole-in-the-wall, country diner feel, but tasty! The only disappointment was weak coffee, and we'd been up since 6:30, so I needed it.\nI went with my boyfriend and his two little ones (2 and 4) and the service staff was very friendly to the kids and accommodating to their needs."
"1","After all the great reviews my husband and I decided to give it a go.... wah wah wah. Hubby ordered chicken fried steak and banana bread. He said the bread was awesome, and that the chicken fried steak was o.k and that Big Dogs is better. I ordered the American Cheeseburger ( i know i ordered a cheeseburger in a breakfast joint ) but I was still thinking its a family owned diner it should be good. BIG Mistake..it was hands down the worst cheeseburger I have had in my life! The meat tasted like it was old and from one of those tubes that you buy for 2 bucks at the store. It was burned on the outside and pink in the middle, over worked dry and tough, the bun was wet from the wilted veggies. It actually made me sick ( i only are 2 bites )The atmosphere is unclean and it smells like dirty grandmas. I dont know how it got so many rave reviews... I guess people have no taste buds! And to top it off it was 35 dollars ( with my daughters 1 pancake included ). Stay away unless you like being sick and paying for it."
"3","We went there for breakfast a Monday morning.  It was near noon, but they serve breakfast all day.  The place was pretty crowded and seems to be popular with older folks. It's very kitschy, but it has that old mom-and-pop diner atmosphere, and that type of menu as well.  We tried their stuffed French toast and their pancakes combos. The food was good, tasty enough, but not particularly outstanding or inspired.  Basically, this is your typical all-American breakfast joint.\n\nFull review at http://www.marga.org/foodblog/2011/08/omelet-house-las-vegas-review/"
"1","I have been to a lot of restaraunts and worked in the hospitality industry for over 18 years and I can clearly state \""THIS IS THE NASTIEST PLACE I HAVE EVER BEEN TO.\""  Right from the get go, the smell here is horrific.  Why did I not turn around right then you ask???? Great question,,, I am going to say that the stench is so overwhelming it puts you into a mild coma and you are not able to clearly function or think straight.  That caused me to to stay.  I was also having not such a good morning so I just gave in and figured something to eat would help.  I ordered a polish sausuage sandwich on sourdough.  Let's just say that the cup of mustard that was on this aboration was too much to handle.  I brought it up to the server who could care less excetp to say \""Yeah, that's a lot of mustard\"".  That was his solution.  \n\nSo in a nutshell:\n1) The restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer.\n2) The food cannot really be called that.  The slop they serve is litterally unedible.  \n3) The service staff has ZERO clue what service is and how to take care of anyone.  \n\nThis place should honestly be blown up.  What a pit of despair."
"4","This is a great spot for breakfast off the strip.  It doesn't have much appeal, but it makes up for it with the food.  The Omelet House has the best banana nut bread hands down.  The omlets and other breakfast items are good, but you definitely need to eat here for the banana nut bread."
"1","The whole place smells like dirty grease."
"5","Big portions, tasty and some of the best service we have received! This will be my Vegas go-to breakfast place."
"2","Food OK service needs improvement my server took my order wrong and did not check until the end"
"3","The waitress was quite nice. The potato chips are awesome. The rest of our food was just ok, nothing spectacular. Place is very old school. It was an ok breakfast in general here ..."
"4","Amazing warm banana nut bread and delicious potatoes! The omelettes are huge...consider sharing. Coffee is not the best but everything else makes up for it. Friendly service and cozy place....the restaurant is inside a shopping center not to be confused by the sign."
"2","I did not have the same experience as many of these other reviewers which is surprising.  I met a colleague here for breakfast during the week and we were greeted promptly - service was fine.  I ordered the Petunia Pig omelet and my colleague ordered the Corn Beef Hash.  The food portions were big, but the taste was lacking.  My eggs were a bit overcooked and did not have enough cheese or meat in the omelet.  The \""homemade potato chips\"" which accompanied the dish were nothing special - would have preferred hash browns.  The toast was dry.  I just wasn't impressed.  I've had many other breakfasts here in Vegas including the other Omelet House in Henderson (which was great).  Not sure what went wrong today."
"5","Banana bread is the greatest on earth! It's worth driving here just for that alone. The breakfast is huge and the price is tiny! My new favorite place!"
"2","*** Kosher  Chabad of Southern Nevada ***\n\nI am in Las Vegas from time to time and I have been going to this restaurant for years spanning several owners.  My last trip, I stopped in expecting the usual avergae - good pizza \""joint\"" fare -didn't happen.  \n\nAlthough the proprietress was... homey and friendly, she was more interested in talking on the phone than waiting on me even though I said I was in a rush.  The place was empty and tables dirty and piled with dishes from lunch rush I guess.  The Air conditioning was NOT ON (Vegas can be quite hot) and in general the place was not impressive.  I asked for slices (in a hurry) no slices, I asked what was fast \""everything takes the same time\"" so I ordered a fallafel figuring how long could that take...  I watched as the guy in the kitchen made the Israeli salad veg by veg thinking that couldn't possibly be for me... after all I was in a hurry -yeah right.  I had to eat quick (and in the car) on my way to my next customer so I asked for no techina sauce -again, yeah right.  So hurrying to my customer eating at red lights the thing became a soggy mess.\n\nIt was WAY overpriced (IMHO) and the place is NOT suitable for a business lunch.\n\nAlso, the coup de grace, was ill the rest of the day -yes from the food but decorum prohibits me from relating the details here...\n\nI will not be going back...."
"1","This place don't need a makeover, it needs a bulldozer.\nIt puts the whole community to shame."
"1","Just called to see if I could get someone to take a look at our gate. The young girl answering the phone, without even asking my name or what was wrong with the gate told it me would cost $225... Asked her if maybe they might want to take look at the gate first, see how big it was etc. maybe let me get out two words explaining the issue but she said that's just what it costs for a repair period and was done with the very rushed curt conversation. Might want to work on that customer service Artistic."
"4","Items selected:  Bavarian, Blueberry Cake, Blueberry Fritter, Sourcream, Buttermilk Bar, Raised Glazed, Reverse Cinnamon Roll, Chocolate Cake, Crumb Cake, Apple Fritter\n\nHaving arranged various \""foodcrawls\"" in the past it was with admitted enthusiasm that I entered Real Donuts to gather provisions for Las Vegas' first (known) donut crawl and with several glistening varieties fresh from the fryer only two challenges arose, the first limiting my order to a dozen and the second delivering the fried dough to the party without sneaking a bite.  A small, clean shop with excellent service and a dozen donuts only $10 after tax and a tip it was up against three other doughnutteries that Real would find itself matched and although the occasional contender from Sunrise Too, Master Donuts, or Donut Hut shined it was Real Donuts that proved most consistent across the board.  Featuring crispy fritters rife with fruit and low in oil, a textbook old-fashioned sourcream that literally melts on the tongue, and both yeasted and cake options on par with the city's best it would truly be hard to name a bad one in the bunch - a task I'll simply discard and suggest futile as I think back on the Blueberry Fritter, a 95 cent daily special I'd suggest worthy of 'destination' status."
"3","My first time there and the young I would say pacific island young lady was  semi friendly it was early right at opening I got there. However She began to warm up as we were choosing the doughnuts we wanted. 2nd time I went was last week , week and few days, and a lady I would say in her mid 30 to early 40 maybe assisted me. I walked in yet again right close to opening, as I walked in I noticed PRE-PAK BOX of doughnuts to my curiosity I asked, oh what are those , I will take one of those since they are ready to go. she then said OH those are on reserve , I said oh, well why don't you have a sign on them, she said they are DAY OLD they sell from the previous night for 5.00 a box of 21 doughnuts and ALL boxes are Reserved. Well here I am at 415-425 am first customer probably in the door, and here comes another customer, a Male who grabs a box of those SAME doughnuts and proceeds to the counter to PAY. As I am finishing my selection of buying my 9.00 dozen, it ERKED me to know she has not said a word to him about these RESERVED Doughnuts. So I did \n\nThen she went in hyper voice aka Busted voice, and told him They are on reserve , and I told HER, Then you shouldn't have out for ,customer perception of thinking they can grab and go, or you need to label them as reserved or you need to keep them in the back as reserved items Should be located . Needless to say she Heard NONE of my suggestions just kept RUNNING her MOUTH of Guiltless that Customer Was like Oh these are the day old Doughnuts for $5 a box, I said Oh I know I just learned that just NOW. However she told me they are on RESERVE, she then turned to him and said Yes they are, That customer, got angry and walked out without further word \n\nI paid my $9.00 only because they were already selected and in a box, but I surely FELT very cheated and very robed. As it should NOT be a RESERVED STATUS ON DAY OLD DOUGHNUTS. But rather a First Come First Serve Basis Period. \n\nNeedless to say. 2nd time was not an invite to Return BACK . \n\nDoughnuts were a bit sweet, however the cake one with cream in the middle was beginning to be one of my likes, as it was one that was in the middle of the road."
"4","Doughnuts. Donuts. Dog Nuts...whatever you call them for the most part, they're all tasty. Well maybe not dog nuts. \n\nLets get real, this place is like a fried dough time machine and I love it. Real Donuts definitely keeps it real; from the wood paneling on the walls to the $1 doughnut, it's like walking into the \""Wonder Years\"" TV show. \n\nI originally came here for the inverted cinnamon rolls, but found myself buying up pretty much everything in the display case. The maple & peanut covered cinnamon rolls, cherry frosted french crullers, bear claws, the classic Simpsons doughnut (pink frosting & sprinkles), maple bars, and nearly everything in-between. \n\nNot to forgot my savory side, I also bought a jalape\u00f1o croissant stuffed with turkey, swiss cheese, and chunks of my favorite spicy pepper. This was delicious; the bread was super soft and I was told it was made fresh that morning. Sure tasted like it! This treat is a must if your taste buds like to live on the spicy side. \n\nBefore I left I asked about the two giant doughnuts that looked like they were drawn on a board behind the cash register. One is called \""The Texas\"" which is a giant glazed doughnut, about 8 inches in diameter?. The other doughnut is called \""The Alaskan\"", this is what looks like a 16 inch fried piece of heaven?. I'm not sure, but sadly it didn't matter, \""The Texas\"" was sold out and \""the Alaskan\"" is made-to-order. Next time, my doughnut loving friends!"
"5","If your looking for a good buzz and a nice shave this is the place to hit up!\nGerardo's is one place i would return to every two days just cuz im pretty hairy. lol On a Fa real tip though im from Cali and when i stepped into this place I thought I was in cuba, It has a very nice ambiance and the staff makes you feel very welcome. This is one of the first barber shops I have ever been to and I have to tell you it is exactly what i expected. Nothing short of fanaminal. On another note I was refered to this place from another barber shop called FINO, a \""Gentlemens Barbershop\"" . Im Glad i ended up going to Gerardo's. It is ThE' BEST place."
"1","By far the worst bank I've ever banked with. How the HELL do you charge your own clients money to withdraw from your own atm??? Um...... they do!!!! It's normal for another atm to charge you a fee...... Well so does this bank. You not only get charged with the other bank or atm fee, but 1NCU also charges you a $3 fee for using another bank or atm. Really???? I can't stand the service. There bank has 2 tellers only, and the line could be full as 15-20 people and there isn't any additional help provided. The list goes on and on. I'm exhausted just thinking about the problems............. oh yeah, they also charge you $19.50 a month just to have a checking account. HaHahaha. I love this free world............ Not!!!!!! One Nevada Credit Union is garbage!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Bank of America or Wells Fargo here I come."
"2","Disclaimer: I absolutely love One Nevada. My review for this location is solely based on this location and not the services of One Nevada overall.\n\nThere just must be something about when you put a teller behind a bullet proof glass case but attitudes here are no where near as friendly or personable at other branches that I am accustomed to visiting.\n\nI wouldn't even visit this location if I didn't have to but since this is the only location with a transaction center, I am forced to. The tellers do their job but basically that is it. Do not expect a \""thank you\"" or \""you're welcome\"". Definitely do not expect a \""have a nice day\"" or \""thank you for business\"". \n\nI hope One Nevada catches on and does some employee intervention with this branch. Coming is here is extremely unpleasant and every time I leave this branch, I always think I need to change banks."
"1","In the LVRJ on Tuesday 15th of January , Mark Larkin from Larkin Plumbing was quoted saying a PVB replacement after freezing should cost between $200 & $400, and after my discount my estimate was $605. I had the repair carried out by licensed plumber for $220. \n Just saying....."
"1","Total scam artist!!  Don't ever trust them!!!  Told me I had roots taking over my pipes and would need to jackhammer and dig up under the house.  Several thousand $'s.  Had another company come for a second look.  ALL LIES!!!  F-ing thief SAM made it all up.  These people should be shut down!!!"
"1","I got a call from my girlfriend that her rental car had a flat so I told her to call Charlie Cheap Car & have them service it. Imagine my shock when they told her to put the spare on herself and call 2 days later because they were closed. When I finally got to Vegas a week later she still had the spare on & when we tried to return the car on a Monday, President's Day, they said no because again they were closed. What type of human tells a woman, much less a paying customer to do it herself? If you expect ANY level of customer service, go elsewhere. I cannot wait to get rid of this POS with 105,000 miles on it & tell them they suck tomorrow."
"2","I love Capriotti but I don't love this location..every time I go there they say the oven is broken. They recommended me to go to there other location near Hard Rock Casino. Which I couldn't do because I had to ride a bus 35 mins to get there.it took at least 25 mins by bus to get to this location"
"4","Typical Cap's right next to my place so it's convenient.  The staff are actually nice...shocking I know!"
"5","Best vegetarian \""meat\"" sandwiches I've had out. Got a veg cheesesteak (morning star chicken shreds) and a turkey and slaw (sliced smoked soy based turkey of some sort). Fan. Tas. Tic. Good bread, good portions, great veg meat, polite staff...I wish there was one of these near my home town. I would eat here every night. $13 for a 20\"" sub just can't be beat."
"5","I love this place! I get all of my uniforms for bartending here. They will give you a discount if you tell them you work in the casinos. \n\nThe only flaw is that they assume that every girl that comes in is a dancer. That is seriously annoying. Just because you THINK I am a dancer, doesnt give you the right to say it aloud. That is just RUDE."
"2","Read the reviews and was pretty pleased.....until I got to this Salvation Army. Major disappointment :/ \nThere is a mix of really old clothes & old shoes, really old worn out furniture, and dishes. I'm not expecting pristine items, but c'mon now these things should be given away to people in need, not charging them!  I was at least hoping to find  anything older vegas style, anything!!!! Found not a single item.....Oh well, on to the next shop.   \nPlenty of parking thou"
"3","Just a tip for everyone, this Macy's only sells home products, it does NOT sell any clothes whatsoever even though the yelp description says this location does - it does not. I drove to Macy's today to get a suit and this one was the closest to my house. I arrived and noticed that the sign is brown instead of the traditional red and it just looked different from the outside. I walked into the store and all around the store just to confirm that they do not sell any clothes. All they sell is furniture, towels, kitchen items, etc....\n\nIf you want clothes, don't go to this location."
"5","The best!!\n\nWe had a thee hour flight delay - no problem! They called from the baggage claim area within 5 minutes of us landing letting my group know there were there. We were greeted by a man in a tux who helped with our bags and walked us out to the air-conditioned limo. We lucked out and got an automatic upgrade since our flight time was messed up so we got the big mac daddy of limos! It was so fun and they had chilled champagne ready to go for us. \n\nOnce we left the airport we turned on the beats, the flashing lights and drove down the strip. Even thought the airport is close to the hotels it took about 30 mins to get there, which we were happy about. It gave us time to enjoy the ride. \n\nThis was honestly the best way to start out the trip and it was very affordable - especially if you split it between the group. They also have deals online that you should look out for and jump on. We took the limo roundtrip and both ways the drivers couldn't have been nicer. Thank you Christopher and David!! You made us feel like queens!"
"2","I found these guys on the web and thought that, for our guys week out in Vegas, I'd get a limo to pick us up and drop us off. I used one of their web specials, made the reservation for a 7:15 PM pickup, and thought I was good. \n\nTwo of us were coming from Chicago and our third was coming from Des Moines. Our flight landed at 6:15 PM and the third landed at 7:10. I decided to make the reservation for 7:15 PM for pickup, in time for our third to be there when the limo arrived. \n\nUpon landing I had a text from the company driver saying that he was there already at 6:15 PM! \n\nI explained to the driver that I had made a reservation for 7:15 and not 6:15. He told me that, despite the web form asking you for the pickup time, they instead go by the flight arrival time. This is mentioned absolutely nowhere on their site and and there is a field for pickup time so I'm thinking that there has to be some mistake. I get his boss' number and call her, a mean, rude woman named Monique, who explained to me what I just wrote above - they go by flight time and not the requested pickup time. Then she told me that I was responsible for the extra half-hour at $34. Not wanting to keep the driver in an odd position I dropped it and paid the extra money. Upon arriving at home I filed a credit card dispute for the amount and sent them the emailed proof with the pickup time highlighted. \n\nOur pickup from the hotel back to the airport with another driver was uneventful - she arrived on time and was very polite. \n\nI would steer clear of these guys and perhaps look at other Vegas limo companies. There are a bunch of other ones out there. I would definitely avoid Presidential Limo since they treat their customers like idiots when the company makes a mistake."
"2","I wish I could give a better review, but I wasn't completely satisfied. When I booked the limo, I specified that the sedan town car was what I wanted. The driver showed up in an SUV instead. I was never told there was a possibility I could get an entirely different vehicle. Also, there was no passenger seat  - I had mentioned that I wanted one. Finally, the person booking the reservation asked me if I would like the driver to hold up a sign with the last name of our party. SInce it was a wedding, I thought it would be perfect. I gave her all the information and she said it was all set. There was no sign or any mention of it when the limo pulled up. I asked the limo driver about it later and he said he had no idea about any sign. Why does Presidential offer it if they won't fulfill the request?"
"3","Presidential Limousines was good, but I had hoped for better. We had a pickup at McCarran Airport, and rented the limo for an hour assuming that would be enough time for the 20 minute drive. I was told on the phone that pickup time started when the plane landed. That should have been a warning! Our plane landed at 9:12 pm. The driver met us at baggage claim. I wanted to stop at a quick stop store (if we had time) she told me right then we didn't have time. I said okay, could we add an 1/2 hour to our rental, no because her next pickup was 10 minutes after ours ended. We got our bags and all rushed to the limo. She quickly poured the champagne and rushed us to the casino. Took our bags out, started cleaning out the glasses and  preparing the limo for the next ride while we were waiting. Handed us a rose and when we asked her to take one picture of us seemed irritated, but did take one pic and left. So Here are the TIPS!!! Don't have them pick you up at the Airport when your plane lands, add 1/2 hour if you are picking up baggage and have them meet you at that time. Even if you have to wait you will not be rushed around like an inconvenience. The second option is to rent it for 1 1/2  or 2 hours."
"2","This is a much delayed review. I got married in April 2014 and since it was just a simple ceremony with family members and a few closed friends, I didn't plan on getting a bouquet. My husband told me that I should get one so I have something in my hands. I went in to the shop around February, 2 months before to our big day, picked out a small calla lily bouquet and asked a specific ribbon color (tan in satin material) and was told it could be matched. The small bouquet which only has like a handful of flowers, cost $90. I thought, that's expensive but I didn't want to run around town for a bargain and sucked it up and paid for it based on the awards and reviews. I even sent email with photos of my wedding shoes so the arrangement person knows exactly what color I am talking about. \n\nThen, the day came, my husband picked up the bouquet while I got ready in the hotel room. He brought it back and boy was I upset. The ribbon was brown. Brown. Dark brown. Not tan. I would not have been upset if the ribbon was camel, tan, whatever. But it was brown. It was not anywhere close to the photos I had sent to the shop. \n\nIn hindsight, I wished I had gone and picked it up myself so I could have had it fixed and instead I had my husband to do it and he had no idea what the hell he was looking at. \n\nIf I ever get flowers again for whatever reason, I am definitely requesting a trial so I know what to expect."
"4","I go here to get my dog food and dog utilities. Staff is nice, if you run into them they will help. The store is always clean!"
"4","Very good food but not a place to go if you are in a hurry. Habib is a very gracious host and explains the entire menu to you if you are a first timer.  It is a very nice restaurant with classy decor. Definately a good place for a fancier dinner date or somewhere to go if you plan on having a conversation with your dinner companions. All of the reccomendations by Habib were wonderful dishes.  I had the lamb and it was so moist and tender and the rice was a fantastic combination of spices and herbs like I've never had before.  The hummus was ok and the pita bread warm and fresh. If I'm in Vegas again I would definately go back."
"5","Four of us had a wonderful evening at Habib's.  It was our first visit. The restaurant is lovely, and prices are reasonable for this quality of restaurant (table linens, a good wine  list, appropriate stemware for quality wines, etc). This is not a jeans and t-shirt place. Understand that this is ethnic dining at its best, and the proprietor will be personally involved in your experience. He will visit your table often. He explains menu items and preparations in detail, so don't be afraid to ask.\n\nOthers have complimented  the oven bread that comes out first with a little bowl of shirazi (marinated chopped cucumber,tomato and onion ), but the eggplant appetizer (borani) was truly outstanding. My husband who, is more familiar with Persian cuisine, selected  a well-known dish after his eggplant, the  chelo kabab koobideh (ground beef filet, char broiled tomato and rice) plate, and he was very pleased. Yogurt on the side  completed the flavors of the dish. We asked Mr. Habib to describe the special meals he offers in addition to the shish kabob plates. These Persian specialties are not pictured on the menu supplement, but be sure to ask about them if you are interested in a dining adventure.  The chicken with bayberry pilaf was especially good. I was happy with my chicken in pomegranate and walnut sauce, a dark savory stew which is served over pilaf.   One of our party was unhappy with her choice and Mr. Habib quickly and graciously replaced it. He wanted us to be satisfied. We truly felt like a guest in his home. We kept a little tummy space for dessert to end a perfect meal, sharing  an order of baklava and a flan which the waiter torched table-side to caramelize the sugar crust.\nWe will be back."
"5","Truly an Authentic Chinese experience. It' looks like a Panda Express from the outside. Inside is a whole new story. Bunch of Chinese waiters running around. There's the infamous cliche of a fishtank. When we got here we were seated next to the fishtank. And fish were looking at me.....So I ordered one. Fried. With a black bean and spicy garlic sauce. Teach that fish to look at me....Grrrrr\nBut in reality. You can order chinese food on the menu. I like things off the menu that only the cool asians know. So my advice - learn some chinese food that's not americanized with sugar and sweetness. And order off the \""cool secret menu\"".\n\nUpdate 6/2/08\nSEE I FUCKIN TOLD YOU - BEST CHINESE! EVER!"
"3","Tried this place for lunch a few weeks back based on the Yelp reviews, and SOLELY on Yelp reviews as based on principal alone I don't think I'd ever randomly walk into a place called \""Food Express\""   Just on a whim I could come up with at least 515,129 better names (list coming soon!), but I digress....\n\nNot sure how others use Yelp but I like to type my address and then find the Highest Rated and \""Best Matches\"" within driving distance.   This one kept coming up extremely high on the Best Match list.   Sold.\n\nI then like to find the dishes most people seem to agree on.   Salt and Pepper Pork Chops.   Check.    Called it in and picked it up 15 minutes later.   So far so good.  Upon trying the pork chops, I was slightly underwhelmed.   Perhaps I had too high of expectations?   They were definitely tasty, but I thought they did seem a little greasy/gristly as I was eating them, and they didn't scream \""freshly prepared\"" to me based on the lack of warmth.   Did I eat them all anyway?   Shut up.\n\nSo yeah, definitely tasty, not quite as impressive as I was hoping I'd find them, and I havent mentioned it yet but the price was a good value for the amount of food I got.\n\nWon't be in any rush to try it again but it also wouldn't take an act of God to make me try it again (hello Applebees)"
"1","I love El Pollo Loco but this location SUCKS!! The guy in front of me was ordering catering and the girl was rude and said for him to hold on. She went to the back and came back up front taking crap about the girl she just went to the back to talk to. When we got up to the counter a new girl was taking our order. Her name was Cecy. She had her phone on the counter and was checking her Facebook as we were giving her our order. I caught her eye and gave her a \""seriously?\"" look but that didn't stop her from cruising along her social media quest. She called our name for food and informed us that what I ordered they didn't have. She asked me what else I want. I ordered what I didn't want. We finally got our order. The food was terrible. The tortillas were really stale. Nasty! I will never go back to this location again."
"3","I went to this location yesterday and I was very disappointed. The lady at the drive thru was very rude."
"5","I love Kelly Chiropractic. Not only do you feel very comfortable as soon as you walk in the door, I have never been to a chiropractor who is more thorough then him. He is an amazing Dr. An I recommend him to everyone. He has helped me tremendously with so many issues. I will never trust anyone else to work on me but him. Dr. Kelly an his wife Jane are amazing people. I know I am in good hands. So if you want the best chiropractor I suggest you see him..."
"4","Well, on my recent trip to Vegas and San Francisco, I made the drastic mistake of leaving both the battery and charger for my D7000 at home...in Chicago. \n\nI ended up checking out various, sorry excuses for camera shops on the strip which were price gouging like CRAZY. Most places were asking for $100 for an EN-EL15 battery and $70 for off brand chargers. \n\nEnded up here in desperation the day before setting off for the Grand Canyon. Thank God. Not the greatest deals on the planet (everything was MSRP), but I felt relieved knowing that these guys were charging a FAIR price (albeit Nikon expensive) and that I wasn't supporting any sharks on the strip.\n\nI was in and out. The gentleman who helped me out was kind and courteous. I have no comment in regards to their knowledge of gear since I didn't really ask 'em anything."
"5","OMG... I found my favorite Korean/Hawaiian spot! \n\nService was awesome. Russell the owner was so friendly! He makes you feel like he appreciates your business.  \n\nBetween the Hubby and I, we tried the combo plate (kalbi, BBQ chicken, meat Jun), hamburger steak, macaroni salad, mandoo, kim chee, daikon and bean sprouts. They were all outstanding. And Hubby likey very much. Kim chee never tasted so fresh and I don't even like bean sprouts. \n\nI cannot tell you enough how friendly Russell is. And who gives you extra mac salad? He does! I made sure he knew how much I appreciated his warm \""hawaiian\"" hospitality by leaving him a nice tip. \n\nWe wont wait too long to return."
"5","I LOVE THIS PLACE. My second review, yes--but I wanted to see if I could add a sixth star. Came back here three more times, and every single time the owner has come out and talked to me. He's such a great guy and totally boosts this place. GO GO GO."
"5","If I could give this spot 100 stars, I would. I just moved to Vegas from Seattle and have been desperately seeking a new Hawaiian spot. This place is second to none. The flavors are amazing, the quality is superb, and the environment is SO warm and inviting. I'm a bit of a snob and was nervous looking from the outside in, but when I walked in I was pleasantly surprised to find a clean, nicely decorated restaurant. This place is AMAZING and if you try it you will be a happy as I am. The chicken katsu and kalbi beef short ribs are the best items on their menu."
"1","If I can give this place negative stars I would. Not so much for the food but the service. I used to go to this place with my Korean friends and family for naeng-myun and other Korean dishes. Today, there was this non-Korean, Hawaiian (I think) person working and was absolutely rude! I was short on time, had a 40 minutes lunch break and since Island- style was right across the stress, I was thinking 35 mins should be plenty of time to eat my food and leave. I was waiting over 20 mins for my food and I understand there were a few orders ahead of me and by looking at everyone else's food, it does take time to cook. After 15mins passed by I asked the guy if it would take long cause I only had 15 mins left to eat and go back. He did said he would check on it then left. Approx 10 more minutes passed by I gave him my credit card so it would be faster if I ate and left. He told me that it takes time to make my buckwheat noodles and that everything was made to order. Ughhh.... buddy I'm Korean and I know damn well that it only takes 30 secs once in boiling water to cook the noodles and put in the broth. Needless to say I took one bite of the cold noodle and it wasn't hand made, it was the store bought noodles you cook in boiling water. The broth was so salty, and the spicy buckwheat noodles tasted like pure hot pepper paste + vinegar and again salty. I took literally two bites and left. The guy who took my order grabbed the checkbook from me and told customers next to me 'shes telling me how to cook brah...'. I know you've been cooking for 19 years BUT if you knew anything about customer service you do not talk shit when I can clearly hear you, grab the checkbook out of my hand, and give me dirty looks. Everytime I came here its the owners that now operate the one at Greenland. They are soo nice and helpful... total opposite of this guy... oh yea btw your Nengmyun (cold buckwheat noodles in broth) and Bibim gook-so (spicy, cold buckwheat noodles) is tasteless... \n\nIf this guy didn't offend me so much, I would come back for their Hawaiian plate lunch, it looked really good. Not so much for the Korean food, I wish the Korean owner or son would've been there :("
"4","Ordered hot rock bi bim bap...tasty, but probably wouldn't order again. I'll try the bulgogi next time...or maybe the meat jun. Kimchi was delicious! Filled up on all the wonderful appetizers before I got my main dish. Ordered manju to go, but ended up eating half before i left as it was so tasty! Owners were welcoming and helpful. I did have to wait for a bit for service as they were so busy, bur it was worth the wait. Will eat there every trip to Vegas from now on. Probably one of the best hole in the wall, and Korean style restauran I've been to."
"5","Local love all the way! This place reminds me of home, Hawaii. I think we were served by the owner. He was extremely nice and told us he was from the Big Island.\n\nI've been craving meat jun and boiled peanuts and got a double score when this place had them both! All the appetizers were delicious especially the kim chee. The mandu was also really good. \n\nAfter we put in our order, the table next to us received hot stone dishes with eggs over easy.  Our mouths watered at the sight, since they looked so good. \n\nThe meat jun meat was really tender and had great flavor. Although, I thought it wasn't quite authentic since it had batter plus egg. I've typically had it with just the egg. \n\nMy husband got the spicy noodle soup with beef and vegetables. The noodles had great flavor and the base had the right amount of spicy.\n\nI would have knocked it down to a 4 because of the Meat Jun, but the service was so good that it bumped it back up to a 5. He was even offering otter pops for dessert.\n\nAloha!!"
"5","I took my girlfriends Lexus in today.Right off the bat I notice that the here service is phenomenal, hands down, some of the friendliest dudes in the industry. The pricing was way cheaper than the rest and they didn't hike up the price after the service. Oh, and the timeliness was ridiculous! I was told I'd be there anywhere from 30 mins to an hour...20 minutes, BOOM, done!\nWhat Mexicans are to the moving industry, these guys are to the auto-mechanic world, excepts they all speak English.\nI'll definitely be back and recommend this place.\nBuen trabaj\u00f3 hombres!"
"4","This is a good solid hobby store. Their stuff is not as complete as HobbyTown USA right across the street but is nonetheless worth a visit if you are in town."
"2","I took my son here to spend about $200 on a RC helicopter. There were a few other customers and I took a spot at the counter. I stood there for a few minutes while another lady was being helped. The associate behind the counter, an older gentleman with a huge food stain on his shirt, stood there while another gentleman helped the lady. This guy wouldn't even look me in the eye. After about 3 minutes I walked to another part of the store when my boy ran over and told me he had to go NOW!! \nAny parent can appreciate the timer that begins to count down when a kid says they have to go to the bathroom. I re-approached the guy behind the counter and asked where the bathroom was. He replied \""they're closed to the public. You'll have to go next door (to the Savers store)\"". I told the guy we were customers, not homeless people who are hanging outside, and my boy had to go bad. The guy just shook his head at me and didn't even say anything. \nWell needless to say we left the store and will take our money elsewhere. Don't waste your time at this place. They have a decent selection, but no customer service. And no bathroom. Going out of business in....3.....2...."
"1","Horrible service. Went for a polish change on toes and nails, too 2.5 hours!! They don't have any gel colors that match normal polish like they said they do. Way understaffed too. Not good quality ether. But you get what you pay for I guess.. Very good prices.\n\nY ME NAILS. Y DID I CHOOSE TO GO THERE ALREADY CHIPPING"
"1","We used Larkin Plumbing years ago for a problem with our shower and were so pleased with their service.  We called them again when we had the same problem in the other shower.  Scheduling was a nightmare.  We had an appointment, waited  all afternoon to get a call that they couldn't get to us. Also, we asked them to call our cell but they kept calling our landline.\n\nWhen we finally got the plumber out he didn't have the part with him. My husband had described the problem. They had a record of our prior repair but didn't bother to bring the parts. So we waited for 45 minutes while the plumber went back to their office to get it.  AND we got charged for all of his time in doing so. The bill was twice was it was for the other exact same repair.\n\nBecause Larkin was so horrible about scheduling, didn't pay attention to our needs and gouged us for the privilege, we will call another plumbing service the next we need one."
"1","They do not honor warranties in timely fashion. If you have a warranty claim they take a long time before they come and look at it. Unfortunately I can not wait that long as we need hot water.\nDO NOT USE LARKIN.\nTheir staff that answered the phone were also very unfriendly."
"4","I love this place! The service is always great and friendly. Their milk teas, smoothies and drinks are all awesome. I usually get the honeydew smoothie with boba but lately , I have been addicted to the taro smoothie with boba. If you have not had the taro smoothie, believe me you will not get disappointed, never mind the weird purple color, this smoothie is refreshing and good. They also have appetizers in here but I have never tried it but it looks good. It is getting hotter so hopefully this place gets some serious business.:)"
"4","Volcano Tea House is one of my new favorite places to get boba drinks. It is located in Chinatown near a couple other shops but I personally prefer it due to the selection, the English menu and the nice, clear decor. \n\nThe only downside is that they only take cash, but drinks are $1+ cheaper then most other shops so I can deal with the cash only rule. . \n\nI decided to get a peach milk tea with boba  rather then my normal honeydew milk tea, mainly because this was the first shop I saw that offered peach. It was a little too sweet, even for me, and I LIKE super sweet stuff. The boba was cooked perfectly though, next time I will ask for less sweetener and I think I may have the perfect drink!"
"5","THIS PLACE IS FLAT OUT, POINT BLANK, NO CONTEST, the best Bobba drink house in Nevada PERIOD! i have been drinking the black tapioca balls drink since i was 16 and now im 29 and i have had hundreds everywhere. Not only is it the cheapest place in town with a regular bobba being under 2.50 but the quality of the tea and the well prepared Bobba balls are cooked perfect. I really hate when people write comments like the balls were not cooked right when they had them in a frozen drink. When you have these cooked tapioca balls in a frozen drink you jepordize their quality. I would say get their standard milk tea with bobba and you will see the quality im talking about. This place only takes cash but they are fast VERRY clean and most of all verry good!"
"2","This place lost everything because of \""Kim\"" working the register. Lose the attitude - smile or go home. There are places where the food - or tea in this case is mediocre but the service and staff are friendly - so you return. Neither were great! There are many choices out there - go try em!"
"2","located in the chinatown plaza, this place is a good place for average drinks and food.  the prices are a little bit more expensive than other places. the milk tea here is standard. the fruit drinks (such as honeydew and strawberry) are not very good at all.. go to the place inside the actual chinatown mall called no1 boba or something if you're craving a drink made of fruit (but scan your cup for hair or pieces of dirt before drinking.. that place uses fresh fruit but tends to lack on the cleanliness part).  the green tea drinks are also a little bit under average (way too sweet and artificial tasting).\n\nthe shaved ice is finer than most, but incomparable to actual snow.  the volcano shaved ice comes with plain shaved ice, strawberry, boba, red bean, kiwi, watermelon, banana, and a drizzle of condensed milk (ask for extra if you like your ice flavorful).   it comes in a small cup (a little bit smaller than the average frozen yogurt cup) for around $5.  honestly, it's really nothing more than average.\n\nthe actual restaurant is quite dirty (sofas show wear and tear, tables are never wiped clean) but it looks like it would be a comfy place to hang out if they took better care of it.  the people here speak english unlike other places in chinatown.  also, there is a credit card fee so bring cash.\n\nthe service is below average.  sometimes its really fast, and sometimes i have to wait 20 minutes for a cup of melted shaved ice.  i received dirty looks from the cashier when i asked them to remake it.  another time, i ordered a boba milk tea drink and she gave me something hot.  i told the cashier that this is not what i ordered and she argued with me saying that i did order it.  in the end i won but i was showered with her dirty looks.. lol.\n\nto be honest i really don't have anything to say about this place.  it is really the definition of mediocre."
"4","This is my favorite place to get boba. I usually order a taro milk tea or an avocado smoothing. I love how their reward system works by reserving 10% of your bill each time you come in. I just think they need to keep their dining area a little cleaner."
"4","Wow, I guess this is the first homemade donut I've ever had? The cruller I had was light & airy but had an actual taste to it. Not just sugar and dough. This is a place that gives Vegas a hometown pulse. The owners seem very nice.\n The location itself is kind of easy to miss. It's an older strip mall and parking is weird. Just sort of be careful getting in and getting out of the place. Look for the big white best of banner out front.\n *IT'S CASH ONLY!!!"
"5","Best Vegan donuts EVER!! I honestly make it a point to buy 2 dozen to bring back home to my friends just because you can't get donuts like these in So.Cal! I recommend Vegans and Non-Vegans check them out! Heck, I've made the three and a half hour drive just to buy them and come back!"
"5","this place is amazing. if you are vegan, GET HERE. the donuts taste better than i remember. the glazed are obviously the best, but any of them will do. top two rows are vegan. if you are in las vegas DO NOT SKIP THIS PLACE!"
"5","Not sure if it was a good idea OR a bad one that I stumbled on this place (speaking in the sense of weight/health wise!)\n\nI wasn't really sure if I understood what a vegan donut was and consisted of, but decided to swing here one afternoon. While they don't have a very varied selection, at the same time what they DO have suffices enough. Their plain donuts are 80 cents! I bought two of the plain ones, and let me say after eating those in little less than 10 minutes... I was hooked. Really bad.\n\nI've never tasted a donut that was as fresh as those. You know the donuts in Smith's or Albertson's that you could get at the bakery, and they taste really thick, sometimes hard because of all the ingredients packed into making the dough for it? Yeah, Ronald's donuts are NOTHING like that. They tasted light, fluffy, and great for vegan. The apple fritters looked extremely tempting, but I'll have to swing back to get a taste of those. I'm not sure if I actually talked to to owner or not, but he was friendly and helpful for my first time. The only drawback about this place? They close super early in the day, so make sure you swing by before the afternoon is done!\n\nI'm afraid I'm going to go Homer Simpson on this place real soon, LOL. The quality of Ronald's donuts plus how cheap they are (80 cents?! That's way better than the deals at Krispy Kreme!) is really hard to pass up. Also, since I've been attempting to convert to more vegetarian/vegan habits, at least I don't feel guilty whatsoever with Ronald's donuts. :)"
"4","Finally got to try the vegan donuts that all the vegans in the world are raving about!  \n\nOn this trip to Vegas, my bf and I flew so we didn't have cheap car transportation to the donut shop.  Took the cab from Aria hotel to the donut shop, jumped out to get some donuts before they closed at 4pm, and then jumped back into the taxi to go straight to the airport.  That whole cab ride cost us $35!  Those were some expensive donuts, but I'm so glad I finally got to try the donuts.\n\nNot that the donuts are out of this world or anything, but I had been meaning to try out those donuts for a very long time now.  Their donuts are just like any other classic donut shop.  Nothing creative like Doughnut Plant of NYC or Voodoo Donuts of Portland, OR.  But their vegan donuts are simple, and simple is good.\n\nI got a whole box to take home to my family in Southern California.  I got Boston Creme, glazed, maple bars, and their apple burrito fritter.  The shop owner was so nice, she threw in a whole dozen doughnut holes for free!  SCORE!\n\nOnly the glazed donuts really tasted soft and fluffy.  The boston creme was so good with all the oozing vegan custard.  The other donuts you could tell they were vegan because they weren't as fluffy and were a bit cakey, but not a dealbreaker.  I wasn't the biggest fan of the apple burrito, that was a bit dry to me.  Maybe my donuts would've tasted better if I didn't come at closing hour, but whatever.  When I went, there were no other customers in the store so it was perfect for my hit-and-run with the cab waiting outside!  Cab driver must've thought I was weird for wanting to go to a random donut shop in Chinatown that was out of the way from the airport!"
"4","3.5 rounded up.  This is a basic bakery that charges cheap prices.  I ordered the cruller, apple burrito, and a couple of donut holes.  I thought all were good enough.  I do prefer krispy kreme.  Has a good following; the place had a steady stream of customers while i was there."
"5","Ronald's Donuts has been on my list of to try for about 3 years, but somehow I have never made it there.  The stars were aligned recently, and we were in the neighborhood to drop by.  So many to choose from, I was like a kid in a candy store.  I managed to put my tongue back in my mouth and picked out a half dozen assortment of donuts.  \n\nThe assortment was delicious.  These were not skinny like your Krispy Kreme variety.  These were fluffy pieces of dreaminess.  [see picture]\n\nThe bonus is that it's locally owned, not a major giant, so you get kind, warm and inviting service.  Goodbye Krispy Kreme.  Helloooo Ronald's Donuts!"
"4","Mmmmm finally had to check out what all the fuss was about with Ronald's donuts!\n\nOne morning I was in the mood for donuts and Ronald's is what popped in my head.\n\nI usually am not a sweet breakfast type of gal, however I was craving something sweet, soft and doughy so donuts it was!\n\nWe got a dozen, the most economic way to go and more than enough to split up between a few of us.\n\nThe donuts are fresh and guranteed good to satisfy anyone who may have a love for these deep fried sweet treats!\n\nWe liked them all and our dozen consisted of the following:\n\nMaple bars\nChocolate bars\ncherry cake\norange cake\nglazed round\nsugar round\nchocolate on chocolate devil's food cake\n\n\nEnjoy!"
"5","This place is so freaking good.  No way anyone can tell they vegan.  The people who work here are always so nice.  Cash only though.\n\nI flew in for my oldest daughters graduation, I had two food wishes while in town, Spam Musabi, and Vegan Donuts from Ronald's.  I know, contradicting food forces pulling at me. ;)\n\nThe apple fritters are delicious, I carried them thru graduation then on plane, and now they are cleverly frozen and hidden at my fianc\u00e9s house in her freezer.   \n\nSeriously, there is no way to tell the donuts are vegan, they are delicious.    Just remember, CASH ONLY.  Also the lady who co owns it is incredibly nice and polite, a rarity in Las Vegas."
"5","Love supporting small businesses. You wouldn't even know the donuts were Vegan,  they were that good!"
"5","yes. yes. YES!\ni'm in love w/ Ronalds and it may be a problem. their vegan donuts drew us in and became a quick favorite for my hubby & i. we always get a box of Ronalds before road-trips. amazing. my favorites are the boston creams & twists. yum!!!!!\ni also dig their cappuccino. just had some this morning! \nand always service w/ a smile :)))"
"2","New batteries for my two Seiko watches was $10.75 each. I figure if I take in two watches for batteries, they would give me a break for length adjustment on my new watch which I bought somewhere else. \n\nI was wrong.\n\nThey charge me $10 for push out two pins out of my band and take out two links.\n\nTo change battery, you have to use new materials. \n\nIf I buy a new band there for $12, they have to do the same work and give me a \""new band\"" , and put it in for free.\n\nTo push two pins out, it takes nothing and no time. \n\nThey crossed a line on this one with me, I am sorry. It's BS."
"2","I only went to this restaurant because island style was closed for remodeling. I have seen this place a couple of times and decided to give it a try. Im glad i did because now i know never to frequent this restaurant again. I don't care what this place looks like from the outside I'm strictly rating their food and service. First off my wife and i had to request the lunch menu, its not offered. The service was ok my problem was mainly with the food. Chinese food should be bold flavors with fresh vegetables and vibrant colors. This was none of the above. I had the pork and tofu hot pot. Again just plain and boring, plenty of pork and iceberg lettuce?!  Also ordered the shrimp pan fried noodles...very bland and just wasn't very good. Being a chef myself i can imagine that the chefs here just don't care anymore. All in all a very underwhelming experience, nothing special about the service, and absolutely nothing good about the food. I will probably never return"
"1","Expect at least five flies flying around. Service has really gone downhill in the last year. Place is dirty and food quality is terrible. Previously they would offer their lunch special, now they try to push their regular menu on lunch patrons to make an extra buck. No longer one of my favorite Vegas restaurants. Never returning after last visit, lady owner was so rude. Eat at your own risk."
"1","And yet another negative report.\n These guys, lemme tell ya...\nThe only reason why I even used this service was that they were across the street from my work place. They get the one star for convenience. \nBut the fellow there had me in line already and just because a couple of others had completed their service, he told me, \""Let me take care of these guys first.\"" \nI had come in for an oil change, and I asked if there was an extra charge for rotating tires. They said no. I asked them how long, they said maybe an hour. So, I indicated to them to call me when it is done.\n3 hrs later, I called them to find out if it was done yet. They put me on hold for 4 minutes. They told me it would be ready when I get there. \nSo, I went back and stood behind one other guy, and made eye contact with the same guy who prepared my order earlier. He left the counter area to find out what was going on. He returned and said, \""Give me a minute, lemme just take care of this guy.\"" So, I had to wait again. \nWhen he got my keys for me, he added, \""Oh, they forgot to rotate your tires.\"" \nSo, to summarize: they are slow with oil changes(3 hrs), they are inconsistent with who gets helped first (they selectively choose who gets helpe first rather than who's in line), they lie about how fast they can do something (they said 1 hr), and they don't do everything they promised to do (didn't do the tire rotation).\nI wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemy."
"3","The Thai iced tea was very sweet.  I don't mind this, but it may be too sweet for some.  I ordered the koi soy (noodles in a curry soup), one of my favorite Thai dishes.  I found it to be a little bland, but still good.  I ordered medium heat, but the curry in the koi soy was barely hot at all.  I also ordered the crab fried rice, and was a little more pleased with it.  The rice was light and fluffy, and not at all greasey.  Again, the flavor was a little more bland than I prefer.\n\nBased on my initial visit, this is a rather average Thai restaurant.  I would return if I was with friends and in the area, but I wouldn't seek it out."
"5","Went to Georges for a alignment on my truck. Turns out my tire was about to blow which discount tire some how missed. I was advised not to take my truck on the freeway let alone drive very far at all because of how bad my tire is/was. \n\nThanks to Georges Alignment and Brakes I was able to avoid what could of been  a horrible accident. If I have questions regarding my tires now I will go to Georges Alignment and Brakes before I go to the Discount Tire shop on Blue Diamond rd since the assistant manager there some how missed how bad my tire was and just wanted to sell me new tires or rims and tires instead of letting me know I only have 1 bad tire that is ready to blow and could get me killed on the freeway if I continue to drive on it. \n\nGeorges also had my truck for a hour and I know it took up space for them and they did have to look at it but they did not charge me anything either. They were much more concerned that I got it taken care of asap and even directed me to a tire shop close by as well as some advice on how to possibly save some money on the replacement."
"4","Quick Review: Great value in the late night menu, good, but expensive food at other times of the day.\n\nLong-Winded Review:\nWhen I grew up in Vegas in the 80's, there were only 1-2 Japanese restaurants in town, but they were very authentic ones that served food you could find in Tokyo.  Fast forward 20 years and we have a Sushi restaurant on every corner.  Teriyaki Chicken is served at Jack in the Box.  You can get California Rolls at 7-11.  There are hundreds of \""Japanese\"" restaurants out now, but they're as close to Japanese as Olive Garden is Italian.  Osaka's menu remains largely grounded in its Japanese roots, but it also features a good selection of \""custom\"" sushi rolls that you'll find in other sushi restaurants.  The menu is extensive, and some parts may be difficult to navigate since it is in Japanese (or the English equivalent, Romaji).  Item descriptions are all too brief and unless you've been there before, you may be intimidated by ordering something new.  It's probably best to ask your server or sushi chef questions before ordering.  What troubles me about Osaka is that I feel it's trying to be all things to all people.  It serves authentic Japanese fare, but it's also trying to be edgy, trendy, and hip by offering experimental fusion dishes and desserts.  However, the fact that I still go there regularly suggests that Osaka's experimentation doesn't bother me all that much.  As with older Japanese restaurants, prices are a tad higher than other places in town ($15 for chicken teriyaki dinner vs. $9.95 at other places), but the quality is much better.  You're not going to get as much food, but if you're looking for quantity, I can suggest some good all-you-can-eat sushi places that will feed you for under $30.\n\nThe real value of Osaka is its late night menu (10 pm - 2 am).  It features a wide variety of food for under $10.  You can get rolls and appetizers for $5 or less, and entrees are available for under $10.  The Japanese Style Beef Bowl is a steal at $5.80 (it's like a Yoshinoya Beef Bowl, but tastier).  It's a great place to go with friends after/before clubbing since you can do a family-style meal.\n\nDesserts are hit or miss.  The Tempura Ice Cream is a great value at $5.50 and it easily serves 2-4 people.  Some of the other items are good, but definitely not worth the high price."
"1","I stopped writing reviews on Yelp because it was too time consuming, but after eating at this restaurant, I can't help but tell the world about our experience, one that I hope will make other people wary of coming here.\n\nWe arrived at Osaka on a typical Saturday afternoon (1pm-ish) and was shown a table in the back room (where the tables were larger).  As we walked past the first room upon entering, I noticed that it was fairly empty but it didn't struck me as odd since there are so many restaurants to choose from in Las Vegas.\n\nWe sat down and were given multiple menus, each one with something different in it.  I guess this could be a good thing since I like having lots of choices.  We ordered our drinks (hot green tea and iced green tea) and browsed the menus for omakase, which we heard from someone (ahem) that it is worth coming here for.\n\nAfter everyone in our party arrived (there were 5 of us), we asked the waitress about their omakase and she completely hesitated. I thought that was strange considering this should be a simple question.  She said she'll be right back, so we sat there, thinking maybe she's just new or something.  But even so... o_O.\n\nShe came back and in broken English asked us if we wanted sashimi or sushi, and we said a little of both.  She then proceeded to say that it's $100 for all four people that wanted it, and I confirmed if it was $100 per person, or if it was $100 for all four people because that makes a HUGE difference.  She said $100 for four people, so we agreed.\n\nAfter ordering the \""omakase\"" - I realized that she must have ordered us the plate of normal sashimi/sushi that was on the menu.  I remember seeing $50 for 2 people for something, so with 4 people, she just doubled it.  I thought sure... why not.  We were going to try their assortment of rolls, but given that the omakase is supposed to be good, I decided to give it a try.\n\nThe first plate of sashimi came out looking decent.  I'm not too familiar with the names and the translation for the type of fish, so I'm just going to say that I tried just about everything on the menu and only a couple items tasted okay.  There were quite a few nasty bites in between, including one in which I had to spit out.  Now, I'm not a sushi snob at all, but when I have to do that, it means it's NOT good.  My companions agreed, and another person had to go thru that ritual later on in the meal as well (said one of the fish tasted grainy too).  Fortunately, our napkins were right in front of us.  =)\n\nAs an additional note, we received 2 additional plates of sushi rolls which were supposed to be part of the omakase deal.  We thought it was just so-so as well... perhaps even bad.\n\nAt the end of the meal, we noticed the $100 + $70 on top of our other charges.  We asked about the $70 and they said it was for the 2 plates of sushi rolls that accompanied our sashimi omakase plate. Needless to say, that $70 was a surprise because we were told  it was $100 for four people.  If they told us they were going to bring additional sushi plates for $35 each, I think we would've either said no, or ordered or own rolls.  Ugh.  I hate when mess-ups like this happen.\n\nWe told our waitress about the issue and she left to talk to the owner/mgr.  The owner/mgr. came by quite awhile later to ask us what the issue was.  We explained clearly about the unexpected charge and the miscommunication but he wouldn't budge.  In fact, he brought up how good of a quality the fish were, and given that, this is still a good deal.  The whole time, I kept thinking if I should tell the truth about the quality of his fish, but I kept my mouth shut in case he was going to give us a break.\n\nI suppose we all could've said something because at the end, nothing happened out of the negotiation.  He wouldn't even take the charge of one $35 plate of sushi off, so we paid, left, and vowed never to come back.  \n\nI've had a lot of sushi before, but I would rank this as the worst sushi AND experience ever.  There are a ton of other great sushi restaurants in Vegas, so look it up on Yelp and go there.  You will not regret it."
"5","We love Osaka!!!  They have very fresh, delicious sushi and sashimi.  \nThere are very few restaurants around that I could say that about.  We've been there many times in the past 4 years and never been disappointed.  As for the person complaining about the price, I understand that you want to have accurate information, however $40.00 per person is very average for a full dinner of sashimi and sushi.  We've paid that much at any sushi restaurant we've ever been to.  (even the gross ones)  This place really does rock though!!!"
"3","I've been coming here my whole life. The zaru soba is good. The sushi used to be better. But I'll keep coming here because I have a place in heart for it."
"5","Really fresh sake. Great rolls. Nice option to get a half or a full roll. Delicious lychee sake. Fast service. Amazing!"
"5","Another great experience at Osaka's!!! We decided to have our NYE dinner at the Sahara location. The food rocked, flavors were well balanced and there was plenty of  left overs to bring home. I have never had a bad experience at this location or the Henderson location. The food always looks and taste fresh and amazing. The prices are always reasonable and you get the quality of high end food... I will make Osaka's a 2013 restaurant  for sure... \n\nFYI, GET THE TEMPURA ICE CREAM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"5","Hands down, the absolute BEST Japanese restaurant in Las Vegas! The best sushi I ever had! You can't beat this place. This is what all Japanese restaurants should be measured against. I love this place and can't wait for my next trip to Vegas to go here!"
"2","I'm big on first impressions, so when friends said this place was good, we decided to check it out.\n\nOur waitress was very nice. The sushi was descent and the beer selection was great.\n\nHere's the bad: terribly slow service. It took over 30mins to make a simple roll. Luckily we dined with friends so we weren't in a hurry but we hardly saw our waitress. I shouldn't have to flag people down just to find out the status of an order. When she did finally return, she gave us our check. She never came back. Had to go to the counter to pay which is no big deal but I waited for 20mins just to pay. Staff just walked by me and several people waiting to pay, not even acknowledging anyone.\n\nI won't return. There is a huge selection of sushi places I would rather go to."
"5","I  went   there  last  Sunday   and  men  !!!   really  god  sushi   I  think  come  back   asap"
"4","I have been going to Jimmy Johns Sandwich shop for 2 years now.I absolutely love there sandwiches and trust me Im a big fan. But today when I came in I was very disappointed. When I received my #9 I had ask the nice guy at the counter for 4 out of the hundereds that were in the giant box of packets of yellow mustard. He said he was only able to give me 2, 2 packets of yellow mustard for the giant sandwich I had in front of me was a joke. He said he would have to charge me 25 cents for a 5 cent packet of mustard. Thats like going to Mcdonalds and ordering 2 large frys and getting two packets of ketchup to fulfill your needs. When I asked Derek why would he have to charge a absurd price he stated \""Because Jimmy doesnt want you to ruin your sandwich\"". Iam from the greatest country on Earth the United States of America,If I want to I should have the right to put what ever I please on a sandwich. I understand that Derek was doing his job and doing what he was told, so I asked for the \""head\"" manager he directed me to Maranda(mustard natzi) a short overweight bitter woman, you could tell she was picked on in school by the look on her face and it was her mission to get back at the world. Anyways she was sitting there while all this was happening and she heard everything that was said. She would not give me the time of day, all she said was \""company policey\"" then  continued to do what ever it was she was doing. This is not right. I had to buy some candy from a local 7-11 just to get my mustard packets. This was the worst experice Ive ever had at one of there locations."
"1","I just can't. This place is disgusting.\n\nI don't know why I do this to myself. But I figured just because I had ONE not so good experience doesn't mean I should ax them out of my food choices.\n\nNo. No. and No! This place must drench their food in grease. This time around, I ordered some garlic chicken dish that comes with \""red fried rice.\"" The garlic chicken tasted....\""off.\"" I can't really make out what the taste was but I definitely did NOT taste garlic. What's odd is that I tasted BAMBOO SHOOTS instead!!! Ummm...what!?!?!?! Why would someone put bamboo shoots in a garlic chicken dish!?!?! Two strong tasting flavors should NOT be mixed like that. And for those of you who know how bamboo shoots smell/taste like would know what I mean. With these nasty little creatures (or tasty, depends on how your taste buds are), you either love em or hate em.\n\nChopstix, you utterly failed in my book. I don't care if you are less than 5 minutes away from where I live. Even if this was given to me for free, I would NOT eat their food. Stay away from here. I'm sure there are plenty, PLENTY of other \""fake\"" chinese fast food restaurants here in town."
"3","Honey walnut shrimp. I was craving some yesterday, so despite the negative reviews on here, I decided to stop by for lunch. Honey walnut shrimp is $11.95 and comes with a generous amount of shrimp and a side of white rice. The food took about 10 minutes so I know they made it fresh. I really enjoyed my food and I have nothing negative to say about this particular visit."
"4","This laundromat is a good price and has flat screen TVs, video games and a theater in the back. Regular prices. nice washing machines and dryers dried all my clothes for $0.75. Good atmosphere. will be going back. would recommend to friends and family"
"3","Food was good. I never had crepes so I wanted to try them. They were good but I'm not a fan of the cheese that they stuff them with. \n\nThe worst thing about our first visit was we were seated by the bathrooms. I will take the blame as I should have said when they were seating us that we would just sit at the bar. The place was very busy and they had the other side closed. I really don't appreciate being sat by the bathroom in any restaurant.\n\nWe will go back and give it another go. :)"
"3","Came here with the hubby & my kiddo today for lunch. I ordered the mexi combo plate so I could share with the little one. It came with a taco, burrito, quesadilla and rice/beans. It was fresh and filling but nothing to jump up about. Hubby had the grilled cheese & mashed potatoes. He loves that combo and was very happy with it even though it looked pretty lame to me. Our server was ok but we did get harassed as we were walking in by some homeless guy..get this..he told us to eat at Omelet House..LOL Weird."
"3","I'm not much of a pancake person.  To me, they're usually a little monotonous in taste and there's always a little too much for me to finish.  I eat them last in big breakfast platters since I fizzle out halfway through.  \n\nExcept for Blueberry Hill's Blueberry Buttermilk Pancakes, I can eat them ALL DAY.  They made me a fan all over again for pancakes!  I felt like a kid again where I couldn't get enough of them!  (However, I get the fresh fruit compote on the side - it's a little over-the-top for breakfast for me, very sweet and a lot of it.)  \n\nTheir french toast is also excellent.  All of their breakfast is a good standard.  Nothing spectacular in terms of seasoning with their potatoes.  \n\nThe service is pretty good as well.  I've been once during the day and usually once every other week at 2/3AM.  It rotates between two different servers and they both are personable and attentive.  \n\nOnce in a while I'll get the Mexican Sampler since a friend of mine suggested it to me.  I highly suggest you get it with chicken because the one time I wavered and tried it with beef I was quite disappointed.  It was greasy and not savory.  With chicken it's pretty decent.\n\nTheir marinara sauce served with the chicken parm and meatball sandwiches is a bit bland and boring, and they're very light with it.  I like to get a little extra on the side.\n\nAlso, they serve small waters and you have to request if you'd like a larger water, which is a little annoying.  I mean, come on, it's water, it's FREE!  Don't be stingy!"
"1","Blueberry Hill Family restaurant Decatur has gone WAYYYY down hill, the food quality is atrocious, the prices absolutely outrageous, and the specials are never available when you want one.  The last time we went it was at 6pm and they \""claimed\"" to be OUT of the special only an hour into their dinner service?  Methinks not.  Never again will we attempt to dine at this establishment."
"4","Lived here for 7 years and been meaning to check this place out. Went on Wednesday AM, seated right away. Waitress was great transplanted New Yorker..\nOnly complaint was the blueberry muffin while large was scarce on the berries. Other than that, had eggs, ham and hashbrowns which were tasty.\nCoffee was good. Tasted some different than the water served most places. Service was excellent!"
"4","I really like this jack in the box, the people are always nice and the food is always hot! When I had to wait for my burger, I didn't order a drink i was standing near the register off to the side they handed me a free drink and thanked me for waiting."
"2","I always thought this was a smaller version of Sam's Club or Costco, intended for vendors to buy wholesale. This is located in the WalMart shopping center and on the 2 occassions I went there nothing was cheap. The stuff I was looking for cost more than going across the parking lot to Walmart and buying the same stuff in smaller quantities. Its a very small store which looks alot like Sams Club inside without having to be a member or whatever. They have wide aisles and cart at the ready but they just dont have much for less."
"2","Meh...some of the residents are dodgy and the apartments aren't that great, but you get what you pay for. I wish I had known the lay of the land a bit better before choosing this place. Great move in specials and the maintenance guys are pretty nice, but the office staff are condescending and generally unhelpful.  I'd keep searching if you're considering Indian Hills."
"2","YUCK!  The Baka burrito was COLD!  It had mole sauce instead of ranchero sauce and they just can't seem to find RIPE TOMATOES!  Even though the meat was cold the bite or two I had the meat was pretty decent. Maybe Baja Fresh will get their act together. If you can do that I will be back. I won't patronize this establishment again until probably July.  To be fair, they did refund my money for a second time in as many attempts."
"5","Best docs ever!  Doc K is a leading expert in Pain Management and is fantastic!  Doc Jarrett makes my back feel like a million bucks!!  Doc K's schedule gets full pretty quick so make sure you get on the books for an appointment.  Unfortunately his day doesn't have much \""wiggle room\""."
"2","Kevin and Tammy seem super nice. Christine has a nasty attitude she does a horrible job. She does not know how to speak to costumers. She really is a b.tch. Tammy had to redo them. Never going back! ."
"2","Was not happy with this place at all. Took my nephews, who are locals, for lunch here, and was sorely disappointed. I order the shrimp with sizzling rice, and got a very mediocre and slightly slimy concoction, but it did sizzle. \nWe ordered a pu pu platter, and it gets very mixed reviews. the beef sticks were good, the fried wonton tastless, and the ribs looks so dehydrated, we didn't even try them. \nThe sevice was worse than the food. First, they do not include steamed rice with their entrees, so we ordered 2, which never came even after we reminded the waiter we ordered them, but of course were included on the bill. \nThey basically dumped our food on the table and then ignored us. We even had to literally get up and get our waiter for a bill when we were done after waiting 20 minutes to see if he would come around on his own. This place wasn't busy, only 2 other tables with diners at them. there was no reason for the bad sevice except the waiter was more interested in his cell phone then serving his customers. \nThere are lots of other places in Chinatown, give this one a pass."
"2","Unfortunately the service here has dropped off in the past few years. Every family trip (about once annually now) we would come down to Chinatown to grab some good eats. In the past this restaurant was bustling full of people, service was quick, and portion/food was great.\n\nSeems the prices haven't changed too much but the food quality, portions, and slow service (with noone else in the restaurant) have dropped off. Some of the plates were okay, but most were bland, over-salted, or had enough oil to make a soup out of."
"1","*Review is strictly for the Taiwanese style breakfast*\n\nDo you know what's worse than losing money in Vegas? The answer is coming here for Taiwanese style breakfast  ...\n\nI don't even know why I came here in the first place, but our group saw the word \""Yong He Soybean Milk\"" (\u6c38\u548c\u8c46\u6f3f) and the rest is history. \""Yong He Soybean Milk\"" symbolizes a famous Taiwanese breakfast restaurant and everyone nowadays just abuses its name. Breakfast is available from 8 AM to 2 PM.\n\nThere was only one server at 8 AM and he doesn't seem to speak English, but at least he speaks fluent Mandarin (errr ....... yay)! \n\nSoy Sauce Flavored Soybean Drink (\""Salty\"" Soy Milk, $3.25): \""Salty\"" soy milk is one of those Taiwanese breakfast item not everyone would love. It contained vinegar, Chinese oil stick (youtiao), sesame oil, and some green onion. Emperor's Garden version of \""salty\"" soy milk was a bit disappointing. (2/5)\n\nShrimp & Chicken Wan Ton Soup ($9.95) - Wow ... $10 wonton soup. I would THINK all food items here would be pretty cheap because we are in the middle of Chinatown. Tasted really whatever and $10 price tag didn't help. (2/5)\n\nChinese Style Egg Taco (Taiwanese egg pancake, $4.5): One of the most tasteless Taiwanese egg pancake I've had ever. (1/5)\n\nExpensive food, below average taste, somewhat dirty restroom, and pedestrian service. I mean ... talk about ONE (like one-star) amazing experience that I probably want to forget.\n\nP.S. - Emperor's Garden serves Sichuan style cuisines for lunch and dinner."
"1","I hate writing one star reviews but this place is so awful that I need to warn those who are foodies like us.This should get a negative star if available.\n\nWe had a party of 18  and was so excited that they seated us so quickly.  However we can not order because all of our group have not arrived. What the f@ck??????    Why seat me? We have 7 kids with us and they served us only their diluted tea. My sister asked for water for the kids at the beginning when seated....waiter shakes his head yes,yes..water for kids. \nFinally my Asian time family has arrived now we can order. We put in our order for all kinds of dishes, ma po tofu, string beans, fried rice, fish filet, stir fried veggies, steam flounder lastly....Water,please, kids thirsty...waitress took our order and yes, yes water.\n\n15 or 20min later the food came...salty!!!!!! all of it...and no water for the kids. we walk over to the same waitress, to ask for some water for the kids..eating salty food. Again shaking her head \""yes, water..kid..water.\""\nWe finished eating our food and still no water husband got up to ask for water Finally 2pitchers of water came....wait for this....no drinking glasses....wish I knew some mandarin or Cantonese or what ever the f@$k this $hit hole speaks. They even made my sister pay full tips. Nasty people. Never coming back."
"5","One of the best stores and optometrists I have ever been to. The store is very clean and open, there is plenty of seating available while you wait, that is, even if you have to wait. The service is quick and if you have any questions, there is always an attendant to answer. Their pricing on their frames are very affordable, and their insurance policy is great, they accept all insurances and help you get through everything step by step.\n\nThe staff at Spring Mount Vision is astronomical, especially the doctor, one in particular. Dr. Kevin Diep one of the most polite doctors I've met. He makes sure you understand everything that is going on and any problems that you may have. His sense of humor is quite entertaining once you become a regular.\n\nOverall, this store is great for vision check-ups, or just to buy those new designer glasses/sunglasses you've always wanted. I would recommend this store and staff to anyone looking for an eye doctor."
"4","For those of you who are going to order Kung-Pao whatever and Cashew whatever, Fried Rice, Egg Foo Young, or Egg Rolls,  then complain how it wasn't good, better not eat here.  This is a Chinese Restaurant.\n\nI wouldn't go to a fine Mexican Restaurant and Order Nachos Bell Grande or Meximelts for dinner.\n\nWith that said,  finding a good Chinese Restaurant in a desert would be challanging.  I am writing this as a customer with lots of Chinese restaurants tested. \n\nThe ambience was conservative and they are open from 11am - 3am\nThe price was a bit higher, but not outrageous, but this is Las Vegas.\nGood wine list, but not really apropo for some of the food here.\n\nThe seafood dishes we ordered were extremely fresh\nWe had a Stir-fried scallop and veggie dish that tasted very fresh and was cooked perfectly.\nThe sweet and pungent shrimp dish was very good. The sauce was made from fresh tomatoes and not ketchup like other restaurants.\nThe Filet Mignon dish was very good\nThe waiter had recommended the sauteed young pea leaves which btw was excellent.\nWe had a Fried Tofu dish that was standard, nothing special.\nThey used good quality rice for the steamed rice.\n\nWe skipped the pricier seafood dishes that spiraled near the $100 mark or more, but all in all we got out for $75.00 (not including tips) for 3 people.\nWe were too full for dessert so no reviews here\n\nI would have to say I definitely would make a return trip here when I am back in Las Vegas again."
"2","The service here was good but the portions for the price and the quality was not. Yes the food did taste good but nothing really stood out. I guess since I live near the san gabriel area im pretty much used to this type of food at a more reasonable price. Good dishes to get here are the black bean sauce clams, stir fried string beans,  and fried salt and pepper sea bass. Parking is easy and the wait isn't long."
"4","I feel like lately I've only been reviewing places I didn't like so now I am going to pick a place I like and review it.  I've been to Joyful House many times and it's pretty consistently good.  My favorite thing to get here are the steamed oysters that you order individually.  I rarely am able to find this dish anywhere else but it is just so amazing.  Oysters steamed with black bean sauce and globs of garlic on top...How could that ever not be good?\n\nOther stuff I've had that were really good are: Sizzling Scallops with Black Bean Sauce and Steamed Live Rock Cod (at $80 it was a little pricey but it was divine).  Most of other items I've had were decent.\n\nThe only thing I've had here that was bad was the dessert.  I ordered the ice cream mochi and the mochi skin was dried up and not chewy, probably due the packaging not being sealed properly.  I might've been able to send it back but I didn't ask.  The fried ice cream wasn't good either.\n\nOh, and this place is open til 3am!  Ideal for blowing some money on seafood after a night of fruitful gambling (or eating your sorrows away if you lose)."
"4","Definitely love the half price lobster when they had the special. I ordered the lobster with thai chili sauce and it was to die for. I ordered the lobster fried with xo sauce before and it wasn't as good as the thai chili style. Honey walnut prawns were the best. Fried sea bass was fresh too. baby bok choi with garlic was a little greasy but perfect. Word of advice, take a chinese friend with you who knows how to order cuz the experience will b 10,000 times better."
"3","Been here a couple times but last week was the first in awhile. Figured it was time to write a review on this place now having visited it once again.\nMy mom loves this place. For this latest visit, it was a family affair. I don't know how weird this sounds. For I, upon walking into Joyful House, the ambiance feels like how I'm used to a chinese restaurant feeling like. I will admit the food is slightly pricier here. To be fair, the food is, for the most part, decent to very good. They do serve complimentary jasmine rice, which not every place would have. Jasmine is very fragrant and less starchy than say, a long grain calrose. It does cost more and better, at least I think so. Along with complimentary hot tea. Even though most chinese restaurants serve these 2 items complimentary, it is worth mentioning since I am aware some places charge for them.\nService overall has been ok. Everyone is very friendly and helpful. There seems to be a lag sometimes when it gets real busy to get something or having water or hot tea refilled. And believe me, this place does get busy! I give Joyful House a solid 3.5 stars."
"3","If I was writing this review 2 years ago this place would have 5 stars without a doubt. The food in this place is really good and the service is also but they've gotten greedy. I've been coming here for years and we liked this place so much we'd come at least 2-3 times a week for lunch and other times for take out. I highly recommend the tenderloin beef in black pepper sauce with portabella mushrooms, their fried rice and spicy crispy shirmp.\n\nThe prices have been on increasing regularly and the amount of food has gone down drastically, not good business. This last time I went for dinner with my parents and we all noticed how small the portions have gotten, it was really bad and that irritated me. The only good thing is that the quality of the food is still there but their competition is very close by (less than a mile down the road) and they've been consistent for years."
"4","My favorite bakery to visit when we are in Vegas.  The prices are more affordable than other similar bakeries in the area, and they taste better than anyone else.  \n\nMy favorite items are the milk bun (or it may be called a custard bun) and the egg tarts.  The bread portion of their buns are really good.  That's saying something cause I normally do not like bread at all.  The egg tarts are very good!!  Just wish, they'd make more.  Many times when we go there, they've already sold out!!!  When that happens, I'm really disappointed cause I look so forward to eating those yummy egg tarts!  \n\nDefinitely, try this place for yourself to see if you like them too."
"1","I came into the shop right when they opened to grab some pastries and pork buns for a quick breakfast. When I entered, there was no one attending. The cashier, or whoever, was in the back doing something so I couldn't ask questions. When the cashier finally came some out, she seemed like she woke up on the wrong side of the bed. I don't know if it was just me or what, but she was so rude. I asked to microwave the pork buns and so at first she didn't want to, then she took it and when she came back with it heated, she just threw the pork buns at me and my bf. Also, she was rude letting us know that there was a limit of $10 to use debit/credit.\n\nAnyway, I ended up getting the pork buns and it was okay. It wasn't the steamed pork buns that I usually get at a different bakery, but it wasn't bad.\n\nI also got the coconut macaroons and that.. I loved! I love coconut macaroons and it tasted so fresh and it was made that day! \n\nIf the cashier wasn't so rude, I would have given this place maybe 4 stars because of their coconut macaroons! Other than that, I wouldn't really come back."
"2","I was expecting more... better... I'm not sure why, but I was. We got a large coffee milk tea with boba and a large peppermint green tea with boba. Hubby liked his coffee milk tea but my peppermint green tea tasted like I had swallowed some spearmint gum. I thought it was supposed to be peppermint? In any case, almost $12 for the two seemed a little pricey. And what's with the attitudes? I felt like I was an inconvenience for asking to place an order. I think I'll go elsewhere for my Boba tea next time."
"4","milk tea, fruit tea.. all good. we ordered snacks like peppered chicken and toast that were really good as well. Wanted to get their shaved ice with tapioca strips, but they were out unfortunately. This is my hang out spot almost every night while I was in Vegas!"
"3","I have made it a habit of stopping here for boba milk tea on my way home from a delicious meal at hot and juicy crawfish.\n\nThis place can get pretty crowded, but the to-go line is reasonably quick. I've never eaten in, so I can only comment on the boba. I am never disappointed with the texture or the taste of the boba. The consistency and yummy taste keep me coming back for more."
"2","Service has always been horrible for the past couple years, even when it used to be tea planet. The good boba never makes up for it and their slow staff."
"3","service could be better, or maybe i am used to service back in 626?\n\ntea was alright, too much ice."
"3","I don't like that you can't just hang out here, you have to actually make a purchase of a minimum of $5 or they kick you out. Overall, cute little tea place that's open until 2am."
"2","This is my second time coming here and I dont  plan coming back. Although the drinks are delicious, the service is the worst. My friends and I were only allowed 40 minutes to order even though there was still an hour left on the clock. Our waiter spent half of our 40 minutes ignoring us. After finally getting his attention and order we tells us they're out of boba. What?! I work at a boba place in California and we will make boba or any drink even if it is 5 minutes before closing. Our customers are very important to us and are given great service, it makes them happy and more likely to come back.  I wasn't able to finish my taro slushy so I asked a waitress nearby if I could have a to go cup, and I'm not lying my friend Lia noticed this as well, the waitress rolls her eyes, flipped her head and makes a sound. I was like woah! JUST BEYOND RUDE! Although this place has convenient hours in las Vegas' Chinatown and yummy drinks, this place really doesn't know the meaning of customer appreciation and good service."
"1","I really don't like this place. Their service is so terrible. They always give me an attitude, and they're oh so rude. The only reason I come here is my friends like some of their drinks. I don't want to be a picky snob and insist we go somewhere else. I'll never have a day where I'll be like, \""hey, let's go to tea station!\"" Icy juicy will provide a much better service."
"1","The food is alright along with the drinks. My friends and I like to come here to catch up and hang out and for the boba.  I think what bothers me the most is the terrible service. The staff is always hanging out in the counter talking the day away. I've been coming here for years now and as the years go by the service gets worst every time. I've had to get up from my table a few times just to their attention. It just makes not want to come back"
"4","Been here a few times during our late night excursions in Chinatown. This has been our go-to spot for last minute get togethers with friends. \n\nPros:\n- fairly cheap\n- open late, (until 2:00am)\n\nThe first time around, I tried the hot Mango Black Tea. I couldn't finish it, as It was a little too sweet for my taste. After trying a few of the other selections on the menu, I settled on the Pineapple coconut yogurt snow ice boba as my new favorite drink here. The sweet butter toast is pretty addicting, and to me, it is a lighter version of toasted pound cake with butter. I could eat a whole loaf of that stuff! \n\nCons:\n- Parking is horrible - I sometimes end up parking in the lot next door\n- It can get crowded, and if you're sitting in the front area, it feels like the tables are too close together\n\nSummary: Yes, we'll be back!"
"3","This place is located in China town in a very popular part of town. I love their milk tea boba and mango slush. The workers are kind of weird and don't really have manners. I still go here often despite the service. It's a good place to hang out."
"4","Tea Station is a good place if you're looking for a quick pick me up when its late at night. I usually go here with my friends before we hit the Vegas nightlife scene or after we have had dinner. It gets busy around 9pm-11pm. The atmosphere is very casual and. Their service has gotten better than when I first came in 2-3 years ago. The staff is more attentive and conversant than before. They have a wide variety of teas to choose from; as well as various food items. I like to order their taro milk tea with boba."
"5","I visited this location for boba. Compared to other asian boba places, this location is very clean, professional, and organized. I really like the interior of the establishment and the professional business feel. Other boba shops even nearby are very poorly designed and not very professional."
"3","Love this place since it was tea planet."
"2","Call me spoiled but I'm used to the land of boba and milk tea, Los Angeles. I guess that makes me a boba snob? Is that even a thing? I guess it can be. \n\nI'm still trying to find a good place for boba, teas and snacks in Vegas and my quest has come up with nothing so far. I tried Tea Station out one afternoon after having lunch with some friends in Chinatown. I've been to the ones in SoCal before and expected it to be pretty much the same thing. \n\nI guess it was okay. I had a green milk tea with grass jelly regular size and it came out to about $5.. It was a little pricey and the grass jelly was just alright.\n\nHowever, this place has a HUGE menu and selection of teas, milk teas, smoothies, etc and a food menu as well! I think if I were to come back, I want to try their popcorn chicken (Chinese popcorn chicken, mind you) which I have been craving!\n\nTea Station is in the same plaza as Ichiza and parking can be a toughie sometimes since there are a very limited number of spots in the plaza so may the parking deities be with you on your quest as well!"
"3","Bull shit customer service. Although I still go 3 times a month. Bull shit. Customer service. \nOh and did u know: you cant bring pastries or any outside food into this place? Even though you order like five things. Lmfao. \nI need to find a new place. -.-"
"3","Being a boba fanatic, when I saw tea station, I got excited because the tea station in both Fremont and San Diego are both very good. However, when I ordered royal milk tea here, it tasted very fake. On the menu it said earl grey tea but tasted remotely similar. Also they never asked me what level of sweetness I wanted which I recall being a pretty big point to this chain. The boba balls are good though! I didn't like the drink it didn't give me that satisfying boba feeling. My friends got the rose milk tea and regular milk tea and none of them tasted that great either. I did appreciate they had nice seating and were open during Xmas Eve. \n\nDidn't get to try the food because I was about to eat dinner but their menu was fancy and food looked tantalizing. Oh also I want to comment on the music. I do appreciate good old jay Chou classics. Whoever chose the music must really be a jay fan bcuz it was nonstop jay Chou for the 30 mins we were there. No complaints though!"
"5","I have certainly had many facials in my life, as not being blessed with great skin. I had a facial last month at Globe, and it was in my top two of all time!\n\nGina was fantastic, addressed all of my concerns and didn't judge me for all my skin sins. From start to finish, the service was not only incredibly helpful (I got the baking soda Microderm), but thorough, relaxing, with all of those touches that are so easily missed in some facials. \n\nI know they are known for great hair, but anyone should run, not walk to have a relaxing facial at Globe. I'm counting down my days until my next appointment, what a wonderful place!\n\nThank you!"
"4","Today was my first visit to Globe Salon, and I really enjoyed the experience. Sam provided a great consultation, great cut, and several styling tips! I am so excited to have found my new favorite salon in LV!"
"1","Very bad customer service in this location waited 20 minutes for a worker to come and answer my question on a electrical device only to find out he didn't even know what I was talking about and not only that their products are a bit over priced...I found the same product I needed at the Home Depot for 2.00 less and my question was answered."
"3","1 star for the excellent 1960s Wim Wenders film squalor and the hell-no-we're-not-being ironic ambiance.\n\n1 star for the cans of 1970s deodorant powder.\n\n1 star for the old and yellowed photos of old Vegas on the walls, and for the hokey mother's day cards in the card rack (also vintage, also just there because they still happened to be in stock). \n\nAnd don't get me wrong, I luv non-ironic squalor just as much as the next former punk rock performance artist turned librarian, HOWEVER (imagine very prissy-ass voice here): your disregard for hoity-toity culinary standards IS NO EXCUSE FOR EGGS FRIED IN COTTONSEED OIL. Breakfast was eeeecccchhhh.  Phony o.j., putrid coffee (seriously, I think I drank the juice extracted from Wayne Newton's toupee, mixed withh the bile of a thousand disappointed stand-up comics). \n\nGo for the photo ops and the sweet cashier in the pharmacy section.  Don't stay for the food, whatever those counter-foodie communists from Lonely Planet tell you.  Everyone knows Lenin had miserable taste in food!"
"1","so, im having kinda of a rough start to my 3 day weekend.  so I decided to go to blueberry hill, to get some potato pancakes and coffee.  first off, I know this place, so I brought my own coke, being that they are a pepsi establishment.  I order my potato pancakes as a meal with eggs and a protein.  I went with eggs, over hard and bacon.  when my food came, I got sausage and runny eggs, the waitress never came back to check on me so I could have it corrected.  I ate my potato pancakes and about 15 minutes later the waitress finally came back and asked me if I wanted a box to take my uneaten eggs and sausage home.  I said no, I didn't order runny eggs or sausage, I need my check.  paid my bill in full and left no tip.  if im going to pay 13 dollars for a meal, I expect to get what I wanted.  and if youre going to choose being a waitress as a career, maybe invest in a pen and a pad of paper, so you can get my order right."
"5","Love Dino's and I went when there were only four other people in there.  I understand that karaoke is awesome there, but it's also just a great spot to grab a drink since it's got a lot of space, parking and is full of locals so you can avoid all the douchiness of the strip.   \n\nI had an arepa at the spot on the corner which was pretty good and got some dessert frozen custard across the street at Luv It - a great one-two before washing it down with some alcohol at Dino's!"
"4","This bar is now one of my favorite places in Las Vegas. 2 shots & a beer for $9?? Yes please! The crowd was so diverse and the karaoke was fabulous! We went there on a Saturday night and it was crowded, smokey and fun. If you can't handle smoke, then this is not the place for you! The bartenders have a stiff pour and the rest of the staff is very friendly. Please be advised that true to Dive Bar standards, there is only one toilet in the bathroom, so you WILL be waiting to take a pee, so don't break the seal ladies!"
"4","Dino's is definitely a dive bar but it's amazing because of it! The bar itself is by no means big in fact I think it could comfortably accommodate about 120 people and that is being generous. The bartenders are friendly and service is pretty prompt but when a rush comes in the drink service does slow down a bit and I don't think it's the bartenders fault more the size of the bar itself. The drinks were reasonably priced and the atmosphere is great! Did I mention they have karoake? If I didn't let me tell you, they have a great song selection and they make it fun! This bar is my new favorite and it's located downtown."
"3","Not as good as champagne's but it will do. Went for a friend.  Not feeling the karaoke.  So we left for better entertainment.  There was only one bartender,  but he was awesome.  The dude running the karaoke was funny.  But we aren't really karaoke people so we left for greener pastures.  If you like dive bats with cheep, good drinks then head over."
"5","If there was ever a cheezy moment in my life, it was here. I was coming back on deployment from the Middle East on RR. and I wanted to renew our wedding vows that we made a couple years earlier. The staff was friendly.... We went through the drive through and did it through the window.... then got out of the car and started taking all these cheesy photos.... I think they knew exactly what we wanted.... It was awesome.."
"1","They called us to come At 2.we waited more than an hour for the assistance .wtf.we made a reservation before.bad service"
"3","We decided to eat here during our vacation in Vegas. We saw a lot of promotion for a half pound of crab with an 8 oz. crab for $9.99! We couldn't pass up this deal so, we decided to go check it out. We didn't realize the fine print that says we had to be a VIP member to get the exclusive discount. \n\nThe food came out pretty good. The crab legs were served a little weird. Usually, you would have to open the crab legs yourself, but they are served in halves so the dirty work is already done for you. Which was pretty nice.\n\nThe 8 oz. steak sounded a lot larger than it appeared. It looked like a tiny little steak that was served with some crab with mashed potatoes and 3 pieces of asparagus. \n\nThey could of have been a little more clear about the prices. Plus, there were no restrooms within the cafe. I had to walk across the casino floor to take care of business."
"2","Mediocre food. Unlimited eating for $30 per day. Go to Belagio buffet for lunch at 3pm instead. $20. Much better. \\"
"3","This buffet was way better than than the circus circus no doubt!  Thanks server bobby for making it enjoyable and for getting everybody to sing for my ten year old!!  The food was ok but...my favorite is the eggs benedict and the crab legs!"
"2","This place is conveniently located in the Stratosphere. Cheesy atmosphere and singing waiters and waitresses with decent voices, not the place to go if you're easily cheesed out. \n\nFood was only decent, IHOP quality, which isn't great quality. I got the California omelette, which was mostly good, except the cheese was pathetically thrown on top, barely melted. The hash browns were fairly crunchy, and the toast was the typical crappy bread soggy with cold butter \nthey give you in breakfast joints.\n\nI tasted my friend's french toast which had real blueberries, and it was pretty good."
"2","Recently ate breakfast here on a Saturday morning in mid Oct '13.\n\nWait : 5 mins for 2 patrons at 11:00am. : 4 stars\nDining room : 50's era diner decor. clean and in good repair : 4 stars\nMenu choices:  plenty of options, and menu was easy to read : 4 stars\n\nFood : my party ordered :\nveggie omelet - 3 stars, \npancakes - 1 star, (undercooked, raw on the inside)\nscrambled eggs - 3 stars, \nbacon - 3 stars, \nhash brown potatoes - 2 stars (undercooked)\n\nValue : above average prices for quality of food, average prices for quantity of food\n\nSummary :\nMeal was forgetable. Nothing extra ordinary. Sub-par for a main-line casino on the Vegas strip. I would likely not dine here again as there are many, many other choices for breakfast in Vegas, both as part of casinos as well as private establishments."
"2","Philly Cheese Steak gave me heart burn bad!\n\nRather not go here again!"
"3","Went to this location as it is nearby the Las Vegas Premium Outlet.  I like Jack in the Box for their all day breakfast menu, and this place was the closest I could find. I did notice a little bit of an element of drug or prostitution or something was going on. But it did not deter from my experience here; this location was very clean on the outside and inside. My food was good and served at a good temperature; the counter person gave me a refill coffee with a smile. What more can you ask for from a JB?"
"1","What was I thinking to step foot in this dump? I had family in from out of town that wanted t-shirts to take home to Nebraska. Bonanza has t-shirts, really good ones if you like lame knockoffs and hoochie mama type shirts but nothing you'll want to be seen in outside of Fremont St. much less wearing it in Lincoln, NE.\n\nIf you want 25 different Las Vegas themed shot glasses, CSI knockoffs, used decks of cards from Harrah's, and 6 different colors of dice you'll find it here. You'll also find overly aggressive security who treats everyone as thieves in waiting, and a checkout process that is a bit archaic. Oh and there's somebody at the door to check your receipt like that's going to keep someone from stealing something? And the staff has to be one of the most sourpussed group of unfortunate souls collecting a check in the city. \n\nAfter stopping here I kinda wish that all the demolition on the North end of the Strip, ie: The Frontier and such had been done a little bit further North. Perhaps once the SLS Las Vegas revives the Sahara some developer will come in and remove this crappy place. While I'm all for preserving Old Vegas, pictures of this dump will suffice vs. keeping the real thing. \n\nThis review is for the Gift Shop only and not the liquor store. Which might be about the only redeeming quality for this place."
"4","This is where people in the shows get their supplies- that's what I was told when I was there. This store has been around for years. Huge selection of materials- fabric, sequins, everything for the creative costume ideas. Unique store. \n\nI came over on a saturday afternoon. After a ton of browsing, I ended up buying a couple pieces of fabric (hot pink & purple) that's still in my craft room, but I intend on making something out of it soon- when I borrow a sewing machine. I've been wanting to make some Halloween costumes for a while. \n\nI agree that the pricing tends to be higher at times, but it's still a small price to pay when you look at the costume prices today. The average prices at Wal-Mart and Target for adult costumes was roughly $35- $45. I've always wanted a Disney Snow White costume but the price is about $60 for the most accurate one. Plus, when you make your own costume, it's not cookie-cutter. \n\nA great source for all your costuming needs. I want to check out the other one (on Valley View) to see which one is better."
"5","Been coming here for 10yrs. Dale and his team are best. They always go the extra mile for me and are very honest about their price. Thank you for the great service"
"1","Service at this Denny's was dismal. After waiting for 45 mins for breakfast at 10am, the manager didn't even apologize for the food coming late.\n\nFood was mediocre.\n\nLocation was pretty sketchy.\n\nOnly go to this location if your desperate."
"3","GREAT SUCCESS! J and I made it to Luv-It right before they closed. Well, technically they were closed (the closed sign was already in the window) but the girls were nice enough to accommodate my request. They had run out of all the interesting flavors and only had vanilla left, but I wasn't going to complain.\n\nThe texture of the custard was very thick and creamy. More dense than ice cream and not as soft as gelato, it was quite delicious. I wish they had had some of their other flavors available, but I was still happy with what I got. If I ever have a car out in Vegas, I'll make it a point to stop by again."
"5","A great Vegas tradition... it helps that I love frozen custard.  Definitely worth a trip for tourists."
"4","Good stuff, been coming for years. Glad its getting so much hype they deserve to make some money. Do yourselves a favor and dont expect a religious experience or you will be disappointed. Its simple food made fresh on site and very good."
"5","I love luv-it.  My go to sundae is the western.  Lately I have branched out a bit and tried some of their flavors of the day.  I might just be used to my sundaes but I prefer them over a flavor of the day in a cone.  It is nice they offer different flavors though.  I will still give them a try from time to time.  There is almost always a line, even in the winter but there is plenty of people watching to do to pass the time.  I do wish they were open a little earlier but when I first started going they weren't open 7 days a week like they are now so I will take what I can get.  My fave downtown lunch is Viva Arepeas then dessert at Luv-It.  So good!  Oh yeah and make sure you bring cash, if you forget there is an atm in the mini mart next door."
"3","I sooooo wanted this place to be amazing! Everything about it seemed awesome. Its super local in a sort of hidden location. Its been in business for ever and the reviews all rave about it. It may of been a bad night when I went and I am willing to try again to see if my experience was a fluke.\n\nI had the Luv-it special sundae which was good but I felt like it was not really custard and seemed much closer to ice-cream in texture and flavor. It was mostly melted by the time the served it to me and it was not a particularly hot night.\n\n It all tasted good but it just was not what I was expecting. Ill give it a second try and hope that I can amend this review.    \n\nCASH ONLY SO COME PREPARED!!!"
"3","Luv-It has an extensive list of flavors but features only a few at a time that change out everyday on top of the regular vanilla and chocolate staples. Frozen custard was a totally new concept for me until my roommate and Luv-It's #1 fan (who is going to flip when he sees the number of stars I gave) took me. It's a richer take on the ice cream I was used to, but gives you the same freedom to choose options that make you thankful to be in America - cone or cup? Toppings or not? \n\nThe downtown location and old school building give it a historial flair that some of its modern competitors can't claim. You order from a window a la Bluth's Frozen Banana Stand (Arrested Development fans, you feeling me here?) which means there is no seating. Which means camping in my car if I want to give my heinie a break. Which means I look like I'm hiding from something - just the message we want to be sending tourists about the downtown area. \n\nThis place is also cash only, which just makes me hang my head when I still see this. Visa takes you everywhere you want to be, unless you want to be at Luv-It, which you should - it is a Vegas institution! C'mon, this is the 21st century now, you don't see me carving this review out on stone!"
"2","Meh... I thought it was very ok... And the girls working there were rude and seemed very bothered by us. I wouldn't go back"
"2","Luv-it's customer service is the only reason I'm dropping my rating. Y'all were rude, but hot damn if you're not serving up some of the BEST frozen delights in Vegas!\n\nNew ownership means more daily flavors, a slight hike is prices, and rude service. So rude in fact that it makes me not want to return, which makes me sad because the product is phenomenal and a Las Vegas trademark. (Who doesn't like buying custard in a strip club parking lot?)\n\nTo the Asian lady that took over here's some advice.\nSmile.\nThank people.\nDon't scold your employees in front of customers.\nDon't walk away from the window when you see people walking up.\nDon't look annoyed when you have to explain things to customers.\n\nI promise you, these little tweaks will improve the energy around your shop and your customers won't have a bitter taste after the cold sweetness ends."
"5","Long hailed as one of the best dive bars in Vegas, you'll probably want to know what you're getting into before you head there.\n\nThe regular patrons of Huntridge Liquor have been going there for decades.  They're chatty and warm, but the building itself is old, the tile floor dingy.  No matters here, the drinks are really cheap and the stories flow as easily as the booze.  This is literally old Vegas.  If you're looking for somewhere fancy, head on down the road, pardner. But if you love nothing more than sidlin' up to the bar next to an old timer with a cheap drink in your hand and listening to how the west - or at least Vegas - was won, this is the place to do it.\n\nLook for the old Pabst sign in front of the parking lot on the Maryland side."
"4","A guy from a liquor store recommended this place to me a couple of years ago. Since then, I've been to this place every time I'm in Vegas. I've only tried the pizza & wings. Both are GREAT for those late night drunken munchies! Right down the street from the Stratosphere.\n\nYou can easily tell that this is where the locals go for pizza."
"1","The worst customer service, and the longest delivery time I've ever experienced! After 2 hours the food showed up cold, the fingers were burnt, and the pizza crust was burnt as well. I posted pic's so please view them. Never again to return!"
"5","First off, reading these reviews, take them for seriousness with a grain of salt. Comparing Boston with Pizza Hut? Reviews from Coneheads from the planet Kolob, is more like it. And customer service? These people don't try to kiss your ass, they know they have great pizza, you want it or not, and I am fine with that, I don't like ass kissers. The pizza is great, lots a cheese, lotsa toppings, great crust, decent delivery, and an offer you can't refuse on Tuesdays, 2 for 1. Two thumbs up for Boston Pizza. The rest of you can go get a chain store pizza."
"1","Delivery  said 45 minutes came in 1 hr 1/2 . The pizza was disgusting . So much grease , after blotting one slice with a paper towel I went on to use a second , and third ... Soaked completely through . My hands were covered in grease . I can't believe people actually say this is good pizza! Gross! I was starving and couldn't even bring myself to finish a single piece. Will never order from this place again"
"1","I have been to Florida Cafe numerous times during the past 8 years because I live with Cubans and I LOVE Cuban food, and this last time will hopefully be my LAST time.  It was never better than ok, and now it is ridiculous. The decor is nice, the wait staff is nice.  However, the food is terribly expensive and it isn't very good.  The rice and beans are mediocre, and the ropa vieja is uninspired.  The piss poor service is what sent me over the edge this time.  Saturday afternoon, several employees roaming around, but none with the title, seemingly, of waiter/waitress.  Seriously?  Is it that difficult to get drink service?  What about a refill?  Can I have one of those?  Could someone check to make sure that everyone received what they ordered and that it was satisfactory?  Apparently not. Picadillo?  Ick.  Papas rellenos?  Ick....were those INSTANT potatoes?  They DID make damn sure to send someone over to take a photo of my group and then hit us up for a $20.00 photo.  Um...No.  Thank you, no mas.  If you are familiar with Porto's in L.A....this isn't even close.  There is a reason that there is always a line there, and never one here.  \nFor authentic food, try Rincon Criollo down the street.  Indifferent service, sketchy location, horrible decor, but AWESOME food."
"2","I visited the all-you can eat buffet Cuban adjacent to the restaurant.  I believe it doubles as a lounge after hour. (The stage, dj booth and large speaker are a dead give away.)  \n\nThe location is kind of out of the way.  Their sister restaurant (Havana Grill) is much more convenient.  The restaurant is located in the Howard Johnson Motel in the sketchy stretch of Las Vegas Boulevard that no one ever talks about (north of the Stratosphere).  I only went  because I had a Groupon. \n\nThe Good:  the arroz con pollo and tres leches cakes (chocolate and traditional) are very good.  The staff was friendly.\n\nThe Bad: pretty much everything else.  Be careful when grabbing the serving spoons, some were hot enough to burn and some were cold just like the food in the trey.  So a lot of the meat was dry from sitting at too hot of a temperature or was cold because it was not held at proper temp.\n\nI doubt I'll be back even if there were another  Groupon, unless I have an insatiable urge for tres leches cake."
"2","Well where can I start. Over the past few years I've occasionally dropped in to eat here in hopes that they would improve. Sometimes the foods great and the service sucks or vice versa. I can never seem to get both at the same time. The past couple of times I've eaten here I've found that the food was bland. The maduros tasted like it was fried earlier that day then microwaved when ordered. The beans were lukewarm along with the dish. It seems like they cooked all the food earlier and reheated it when I ordered it. The Sangria was the only thing that was decent. The service was good AFTER the waitress decided to come to our table to help us which took a while.  The Yuca con Mojo used to be really good here but the other day it was dry and tasteless. The only reason why I keep trying this place out is because there are very few choices in town. Not going anymore after this."
"2","The food is AMAZING but the service is absolutely HORRIBLE.  The waitress is not very nice and is always in a rush. Do not eat there on your lunch break because you will be late going back to work. My husband went for lunch and ended up walking out because they were taking too long. People who came after him were getting their food 1st. When he was walking out the waitress said his food was on the way out and he said he had been waiting a long time and had to leave she then asked him to pay!!! He just left.  One time when I went there I was still ordering and she was walking away! I don't understand how that lady is still employed there.. she is always there during the day so maybe when she's gone it gets better..."
"2","The food was not memorable.  The service was lousy.  My husband and I were seated and our order was not taken for just over a half hour. We sat there and watched as other groups/individuals were seated and had their orders taken before us.  We kept trying to get our waitresses attention and had no success for quite awhile. We should have just walked out. But we stayed, eventually ordered and had an o.k. meal."
"2","From the outside, with all the lights I was expecting more. It's fun  if you want to kill time and walk around looking at cheap gifts.  Lots of security throughout shop, and you cannot carry any large bags in the store.  They will take them from you and you can pick up when you exit building."
"3","How should I rate and yelp this place without being judge?? Haha I don't care!!! \n\nAway from the kids once again.... Rent a car, drove to Vegas, got there in 3 1/2 hours at 80 mph. arrived at 12:35am. \n\nWe met with 2 other couples, drag them out from the Baccarat tables at Caesars Palace to go grab a drink with us at OG. \n\nThe best way is to call O.G. and make a reservation, they will sent out a limo to pick you up at your hotel. This way you don't pay a cover charge. You buy a greygoose bottle or any other liquor bottle and get only \"" Smirnoff \"" free. The bill came out to be 415.00 include tax & tips. And other entertainments would come out of each individual's pocket. hehehehe We had a nice booth with shear curtains. \n\nohhhhh,,, eeewwwwwwwwww,, ahhhhhhhhhh Us girls wondered upstairs to check out the men, It was very empty. Just a few girls with these hot hot men. Their bodies were tight, abs hanging, guns flexing,, yikes .. I was a little intimidated because they started to came at us like fresh meat. We turned and darted downstairs. \n\nMy husband said \""back so soon\"", LOl.... \n\nWell, we all had lap dances, some good, some horrible, some real, some fake ::)) Use your imagination. \n\nI recommend to go in groups of couples, you'll have the best time because it is just fun."
"3","Bachelorette party in Vegas = journey to strip club. \nVIP package offers limo service to pick you up from your hotel and drop you back, plus going straight inside and 2 well drinks. \nStarted in the guys room. I felt like the guys all stood behind us just waiting to pounce on an unsuspecting lady and con us out of a lap dance and $20. Nice views though, definitely. Girls room was loud and smoky, don't really remember too much more.\n\nDefinitely recommend getting the VIP package for you and your girls."
"2","\""Free limo and no cover\"" my ass.  Upon arriving at the OG, in the ghetto, by a limo that we were told was \""completely free\"", we were informed that it would be $25 per person.  Granted this included 2 drinks, but I want to dictate my boozing, not someone else.  So I get my drinks, which are completely watered down by the way, and watch some of the girls.  Some were pretty, most were not and all but one were pushy.  No, I don't want a dance.  If I do, I know where to find you and how to ask for one.\n\nFast forward to the stage.  I'm there watching the vagina in my face, albeity behind the girls panties, and my buddy is ordering from one of the cocktail waitresses.  His gaze is away from the dancer for maybe 30 seconds.  I turn and get his attention to check out the dancer, and when he does, she looks at us and says \""You guys aren't even paying attention to me!  Assholes!\"" and then leaves.  I couldn't help but laugh hysterically and go to the bar.  I have 4 or 5 Bud Lights @ $10 bucks apiece.  Each with a $2 tip  Earlier, I had tipped another $10 for my 2 booze drinks as well as another $10 for drinks I bought for my buddies.  Altogether, our group probably left this bartender over $100 within an hour and a half.  \n\nI feel thirsty.  I order a ginger ale.  He tells me $10.  I tell him I just wanted a ginger ale, nothing in it. \""Ten dollars\"".  I laugh in his face, take the rest of my money off the bar and gather the guys to leave.\n\nIf you fucks over there are reading this, you screwed up bigtime. The 6 of us were just getting ready to do private dances and were preparing to stay until you kicked us out.  Die in a fire, all of you.  Except the hot cocktail waitress with the nice tits and personality."
"1","I agree 150% with the other reviews I've read about how they \""milk\"" money out of you. I had FIVE different male dancers within a span of 7 minutes whisper in my ear telling me to get my friend (the bride to be) on stage for a dance, and all reminding me that it's $40. They come up to you, start dancing all of up on you,  and when they're done, whisper again in your ear...$20. Back home in Hawaii, I got into a male review for free and they do waaaay more for basically nothing. The only time you whip out your cash is if you want a second round. Drinks were $12, but in a small glass. And just to add, yes... the dancers have amazing bodies, but their faces... Can we get paper bags please!?!"
"1","Don't waste your money here. The guys are aggressive and talk gibberish to have you pay $20 to rub their sweaty balls on you. It is utter disappointment. Save your money and go see a produced show. They'll come swarming like bees and then run away when you don't take them up on their offer. Never again."
"4","Just went here let me say it was lots of fun , very pact seating wasn't too great, drinks were good make sure you get JOAN he is beyond dreamy, sexy and just BEAUTIFUL you definitely won't regret it!!!!!"
"4","I found Snick's first on Yelp looking through a list of dives near Theatre 7, and through word of mouth (a friend who had been there before).  Snick's, being just two spaces down from Theatre 7 was the ideal candidate for drinks after an event held in the lot this past First Friday/Pollygrind kick-off party event.\n\nThe bartender (the shorter, gray haired fella) was incredibly friendly, and cracked jokes all night with everybody he talked to it seemed.  The drinks, even the more quality beers, were relatively cheap.  I'm told that on Saturday nights there is an evening happy hour that is awesome, but we didn't make it out there the following day.\n\nThe jukebox is great!  The selection is good, but it really shines with the search feature.  I've searched many a juke in my day, and this one turned out some of the most obscure tunes I could think of."
"5","Go see Randy! That's all I have to say. Every time I go in, I talk sports with him and he does a great job. It's worth every penny there. Great atmosphere, up to date sports magazines, flat screen TV's, and great people. Just an all around cool and chill place to be."
"1","I'd rate it a ZERO if I could.  Sat down & was not even acknowledged. After 15 minutes I decided to leave. Waiters & waitresses saw us but never once came to our table. RUDE. OH! & the place smelled like shit & they couldn't even spell Fried rice correct in their menu. Steeeer Awayyyy."
"4","I used to shop at this thrift shop a lot in my 20's. I used to love wool v-neck sweaters and vintage button down cardigans (kinda like the ones that Mr. Rogers wore)- and yes, they had that old funky smell someone mentioned on another thrift store review (so cali). I had a vintage clothing addiction that sometimes this place would feed- navy uniforms, dresses, printed collared shirts, wool plaid shirts. I was in college at the time and wanted to express myself through clothing, plus I didn't really want to wear what everyone else was wearing (I still shopped in the malls too BTW.). Most of the customers were older, and not too many from my age group came here to shop, which was even cooler. I still have my treasured finds from here: two vintage cocktail vanity chairs in mustard yellow and white (one in each color). They are in need of some repair (the wood) but not giving them up (do you know who hard it is to find art deco stuff?). \n\nSmall parking lot, but you may find parking along the street, if you're lucky and you can parallel park (you'd be surprised at how many people don't know how to do that, I'm from the bay, so you know I'm experienced). It's also kinda small, compared to Savers (the thrift department store). But hey, if you don't find anything, go up the street to Savers, it's not far.\n\nThis is before Buy/Sell/Trade places became popular, enter Buffalo Exchange, a few years later.  For years, I saw the same manager, who was so nice and pleasant (seemed to be a good mood every day, didn't seem to have bad days ever); wonder if he is still there. For the most part, did not have too many problems with questionable people. I need to check this place out again, maybe over the weekend."
"4","Set along the decaying ruins of Las Vegas Boulevard South, Rincon Criollo is a true departure from the glitter and gulch of Vegas. There seems to be something of theme developed along LVBS, with a Salvadorian and another Cuban restaurant in proximity to each other. This one is set in a bland storefront, but once inside the atmosphere feels more Havanian than anything else. The food is simple and spicy and delectable: hot crusty bread and butter, as mentioned in another review, spicy chorizo, steaming rice and beans, chicken that cleaves to the bone, yuca and plantains and pressed cuban sandwiches. The staff seems to be all Cuban, and prepare everything in big pots in the back kitchen. They treat you with genuine hospitality, and aren't particularly concerned with turning the table and running up the tab. Sit there as long as you like and peer through the dusty storefront windows at the sunburnt downtown avenues. It is probably impossible to stay or visit downtown, see the humble immigrant businesses and the few tawdry titty bars set along a background of near shantytowns, and not question how so much glamour and wealth could neighbor such impoverishment. \n\nIn any case, turning back to the Rincon interior you'll find one whole wall engulfed by an aging aerial photo of Havana. The picture displays the Malecon sea wall as it weaves along the waterfront. The water is that tepid blue that suggests a photograph from the sixties or seventies. We ate under its shadow and thoroughly enjoyed what might be characterized as a repast, under the watchful eye of our waitress, who bore a helpful smile our entire meal. After we'd finished, we walked back out into the hot Vegas sun and stood along the unforgiving pavement for a few minutes, soaking in the strangely charmless vista of Old Vegas. Strange place for a Cuban restaurant, but in its oddly dislocated way it seemed to fit right in."
"3","We were the only ones in there on a sunday afternoon which I thought was weird after my friend raved about this place. Our food came out so fast that they would not even have had time to microwave it and put it on a plate so I know everything was pre-made. Food tasted alright just tons of bones in the chicken and the fried pork was so hard I almost chipped my tooth. Is this how you cubans prefer it? \n\nParking lot is around back. Absolutely ensure that you lock your car and DO NOT walk alone in this immediate area. \n\nI would go back but I would try to order something on the menu that they hopefully will make fresh. I gave them three stars for being very friendly, being bilingual, and for not giving me food poisoning."
"4","I've been coming here for years and everytime it's just as good as the last and the portions are satisfying especially for the price.  The bread in beginning is light and toasty, the before you know it your food is here. Flavorful rice, black beans, salsa chicken and chicken bistec is the best I've tried so far. Who cares about the neighborhood no one bothers you, it's just at the north part of the strip where all of the chapels are."
"5","As I came into this quaint little place with a loud soap opera tv show being played in the background, the fresh and wonderful smell of a hot cup of Cuban coffee brewing and an old lady that looks alot like my grandma in bedroom slippers sweeping the floor, I knew right then that I came into a gloriously authentic Cuban hole-in-the-wall in the midst of all the noise and hype of the usual Las Vegas. All men and women must try this little piece of HONEST and downright DELICIOUS rustic cuban cuisine.\n\nAs I ordered my food, I realize that I am still in shock..Am I in Miami?... Nah,not even..Almost felt like I was in a Cuban city rather, before food rations and lack of resources were constant in the country, of course. Which is a shame, by the way, because Cuban cuisine is one of the most flavorful and tastiest kind of food that you will ever eat!!\n\nThey brewed my cafe con' leche (coffee with milk) just as I liked it, as my own mother used to make it, with extra sugar too as ordered! Thick, sweet and very satisfying. As you are reading this review, you are now obligated to try the Cafe con Leche, extra sweet, just for me. You will not regret it either!! \n\nThe Pollo Fricasse was very generous and tasty; tender and moist chicken breast with chunks of seasoned potatoes and spanish olives in a red, zesty stew. Goes great with some creamy black beans and white rice. I ordered some fresh avocado with marinated onions ('mojo' or 'mojo de cebolla';not listed on the menu, you just gotta ask for it, it's a cuban thang) on the side to compliment the already-rich taste of everything that I was delightfully shoving into my mouth!! I also ordered a pineapple soda (Jupi\u00f1a) with my meal, a common fizzy drink in Miami that is by far the best pineapple soda I ever tried..EVER. \n\nNext time you make a trip to the big ol' Las Vegas, avoid those overtly expensive and gawdy restaraunts for once and give this rustic gem a try. 'Florida Cafe' and all the other more hyped and obnoxious so called 'cuban' or carribean joints in LV and The Strip have nothing on what is truly honest, humble and simply good grub ESTILO CUBANO!!"
"1","Since this place was close by I chose them for a smog check. My check engine light was on, and apparently when that light is on it's an automatic fail. I didn't know this beforehand. Anyhow about 45 minutes later I was called into the shop and told my car looked fine, but I needed a flush and this and that. I said no, my car isn't fine, it overheats. So now the man (manager?) was now trying to sell me something else. So I told him I would think about it. I was walked over to the desk and he said since your check engine light is on it's an automatic fail. So wouldn't the right thing to do be to reject the car as soon as it was turned on and they saw the check engine light was on? I waited over 45 minutes for nothing? And then on my receipt it listed that I rejected tire rotation when it wasn't even offered. I will never, ever go back there!!"
"1","I checked out this dealership on Yelp prior to visiting them as I found them online and was interested in a truck they had listed on Cars.com.  I read the Yelp reviews... some great, and some poor and decided I'd make a visit to see the truck even though they had some pretty bad reviews on here.\n\nI don't live in Vegas, but am in town right now for Pubcon (a Search Marketing conference) for the next few days.  I contacted them and let them know I wanted to set up an appointment with them on Wed. morning to see the specific truck I was interested in.  We scheduled the appointment a few days prior to me being in town.  I then called them Wed. morning about an hour prior to my appointment to confirm the appointment and to make sure the truck I wanted was there.  I let them know I'd be by in about an hour and was looking forward to seeing the truck.  Appointment confirmed.\n\nI show up at 9:45 am, about 50 min. after I called and am greeted outside by a sales woman.  She brings me in, sits down and asks my name, pulls up my appointment and then takes me over to see the manager.  The manager pulls up my appointment and says to me - \""oh, you're hear to see truck X, (not listing what I want so I don't get spammed here by other dealers) it's really nice.\""  She then calls over a salesman to take me over to the trucks location and show it to me.  I head out the door with him and after a hundred yards or so as we're heading toward another building he tells me that the truck I am interested in was sold yesterday.\n\nAt this point, I'm annoyed! not because the truck is sold, but because NO ONE told me that when they had a chance to save me the trouble and time it took to go there, check in, talk to the manager, etc.  I'm in town on business and making a trip out of my way to see this truck and they knew it was sold... so why keep my appointment? Why invite me in?  Why send me to the manager and a salesman?  Simple answer, they figured why tell him it's sold; let's just get him in here and see if we can sell him something else instead.  PROBLEM is that is a total waste of my time.\n\nInitially I thought, maybe they didn't know it had sold when we spoke on the phone to confirm the appointment???  Now that I've thought about it more, I don't buy it though and that's why I'm giving them a bad review here and I don't buy the manager telling me: \""oh, you're hear to see truck X, it's really nice\"" and here's why.  After I spoke to the manager and she called over the salesman she wanted to help me, we walked right outside and began talking while walking toward the lot and on the way he told me the truck had sold.  He didn't have any paperwork to check on it, he didn't call anyone on the way, we didn't go to an empty stall and then he called someone and said, where is X truck at?  He just knew that I was there to see the truck and it had sold the day before.\n\nAnyway, after he told me the truck had sold I told him my visit there was a waste of time and that I wished they would have told me earlier, etc.  He quickly checked his inventory to see if they had anything else on the lot that was similar to what I wanted and they didn't and that was that, I left."
"1","This is where poor lambs go to get slaughtered. I should have brought my gun with me in here 8 yrs ago when they did not want to give me back my keys after I test drove their camry. I was a young pup back then but stupid me for bringing in a blank check. They passed me up their hierarchy of sales lowlifes trying to close the deal. I had to rip the blank check in their faces so they would give me back my keys. If you have a concealed weapons permit and a handgun, proudly wear it in this fine establishment."
"5","What a great meal and a great night! We dressed up in vintage and went and had a ball. \n\nWe started with drinks at the full bar. Our bartendress was jovial and knew her craft. \n\nOnce we were seated, the service staff was unfussy, professional yet friendly, and perfect. \n\nWe ordered the Calamari, Artichokes Franchese and Buffalo Mozzerella appetizers. The artichokes were so good I asked to changed my main dish to them over some angel hair pasta, which they graciously obliged. Everyone of us loved their meal (I have to admit, I was so into my meal that I forgot to check out what everyone else was having) and the portions were large enough to have the leftovers for lunch the next day (still fantastic!). No one left a scrap. \n\nThe entertainer was as lovely woman who played classic hits with her electric organ and played some very dance-able hits from the 70s and earlier. \n\nWe've decided this place it a must-see every single frickin' time we're back in Vegas.\n\nThey have a large parking lot right out front, too."
"1","lord have mercy on my bowels...the burritos will cause you pain. eat one if you need a colon cleanse. only eat here during the zombie appocolypse"
"1","If I could give this place NO stars, I would! The polishes are super cheap (I ended up repainting when I got home), waited and stood in the entrance while a rude worker directed where clients went and offered no open seating to the others standing in the front of the shop, nor cared.  ICE COLD water for manicure bowl, no base coat, high upsells on basic polish designs and asked for an additional $1 for using my debit card AFTER it was swiped and signed for (which mean lady in front of shop SHOUTED from her CHAIR to my Nail Tech, who was VERY nice... in the BACK of the salon). Hair and Nail Zone is Hair and Nail Drones... as the staff looked so unhappy to be there and I was, too! I'll NEVER BE BACK and I wish Tabitha Coffey could visit this place and turn them into a professional and organized business!"
"1","NEVER GO HERE!! \nI started going here the first time I went it was very pleasant, this second and last time i went was a total disappointment, the so called \""owner\"" is very rude, inappropriate and very unprofessional!! The person who did my nails was hrs worst ever!! She would push my hands very aggressively and made me bleed!! They're unappreciative and say very bad things about the costumers!! I find it extremely unprofessional to act this way even your an owner, I feel like she needs to learn what the meaning of costumer service is! Don't waste your time going herd because the wait is usually about one hour and the service is the worst!! I completely discourage anyone from going here because you won't be treated with respect!!"
"5","added the lengua taco to the tried list today -- wow -- so delicious...\n\ndon't know what Gabriel is talking about fried fish -- their fish is only served as cocktails or on the half shell (oysters) -- no fish tacos -- nothing fried.  And the cashier always speaks english -- she has to since she runs the drive thru, too -- \n\nYes, there aren't that many white folk -- but that's fine with me -- Took my 72 year old white mother for tongue and pastor tacos -- and to share a shrimp cocktail, with watermelon juice --   tears, people, tears, it was so good...   I keep looking for flaws, but there just aren't any."
"5","walking in to this place you smell all the carne asada cooking on the grill nothing like fresh cooked meat not like other places where they reheat it\nI was worried i wasnt going to find a burrito/taco place coming from san francisco i had 100's to chose from and i got nervous when everyone said robertos was the place to go.  Anyways LOS TACOS ROCKS \nthe tacos are loaded meat beans cheese and avocado and the burritos are awesome always hit the spot place is packed during lunch i usually hit up the drive though feel like its a little faster they have a lot of stuff on the menu definitely worth checking out"
"5","the tacos are off the hook yummmmmmmmy"
"2","I don't know what happened to this place.  I used to eat here at least once a week and LOVED their food.  They recently raised their prices and seemingly lowered the food quality.  The junior carne asada burrito was always my go to....a good sized burrito for $3.  I'd order it without beans and it cost me an extra .60.  Since when do places charge to take things OFF?!  Oh wait....okay, .60, I'll deal with it.  NOW they are charging $4.25 for the same burrito and a DOLLAR to NOT have beans in it.  What the fuck?  My junior carne asada burrito w/just meat n cheese was almost $7 the other day (because of course cheese is extra too...as is sour cream, avacado, etc.).  It was lacking in the meat department and had a huge glob of cheese.  So disappointing.  :("
"1","This was one of my favorite Savers locations.  Cute clothes at reasonable prices.  However, as of late, talk about price gauging.  Used donated jeans for $50.  Give me a break!  Expressed to manager that their pricing has become unreasonable for used donated clothing.  Would not hear any of my comments.  I was told that jeans were \""NEW\"" even though it did not have any tags and if I looked up the item online I would find the jeans at the same price. \n\n I thought that Savers was categorized as a \""Thrift Store\"".  Since when do you compete with online retailers?   How do you help your community with those on a limited budget.  You are taking advantage!"
"1","Our experience with the office staff has been unpleasant every time, both on the phone and in person for visits. The wait is always long (atleast an hour, even first thing in the morning) and it takes forever to get your questions answered. \nThey are incompetent when it comes to billing/insurance issues and have completely overlooked our past records from other pediatricians (which would have given our child 4 immunizations that he'd already been given.) In order to get an immunization record, we needed to make an appointment for an office visit. \nThe pediatrician was short with us, seemed annoyed with any questions, and basically told us to go to the ER if we had a concern. \nWe are never coming back here. This place came recommended, but apparently it's not for informed parents who want to be involved in their child's healthcare."
"1","I took my newborn at cascade location for her very first visit and the front staff are horrible. They dont make u feel welcome in any way.no hi, no good morning like they hate their job(they suck and miserable). Dont bother calling their medical assistance phone line because no one will reply. We called a couple of times and after 48hrs still had no reply, seems like they dont care about our concerns with the babys health but I bet theyre on point on billing matters. I recommend united healthcare at sw location with dr Dani my other child used to go there, Its just too bad they dont take culinary insurance."
"5","Was in need of a serious hair cut and beard trim and my brother recommend that I go here , Freddie was the barber who cut my hair and everything came out clean ! great service , great vibe, definitely will be coming back to this barber shop , would really recommend to anyone , these guys know what they are doing !"
"1","We purchased our home and it has the warranty paid for through August so of course we used it when having problems with our dishwasher. After having their repair people over here 5 times *(6 weeks of service calls and parts being ordered and then having GE come out and give it a try) GE said it would cost $426 to repair including the part and Home Warranty decided to \""cash out\"" which means they paid us $175 for the part since they weren't willing to pay for the labor. REALLY? To replace it with the exact same unit would have cost $1,300 for some reason. The girls that answer the phone act as if we got the deal of the century since they paid us.  The coverage states DISHWASHER: All components and parts, including entire unit.  I guess that means if it's one part that requires a lot of labor you are out of luck.  This company is a complete waste of time and money and I honestly feel like they are in business to collect you $55 service call fees and you get the added bonus of waiting 1/2 day for the repair person to come out. It's a much better deal to get a great handyman and when an appliance can't be repaired to replace it since this warranty company obviously doesn't actually replace a unit."
"1","No stars for this company.  I've had a contract with these people for 8 YEARS since I purchased my home and they came with the sale.  In the past 8 years their service was good, never any problems. I had service at my house at the end of November.  I had my monthly payment scheduled for the 26th of each month.  When I didn't see it deducted for 26 December I called the office.  In the past when my contact was to be renewed I would receive a new contact and promptly would renew the contract.  When I called on the 29 of December I spoke to an agent who had to have been the rudest individual that I've spoken too.  She informed me that my contract was cancelled and that it COULD NOT BE RENEWED without me sending in a letter.  I asked why it could not be renewed and was told that she could not / would not give me this information.  She then suggested that I find another CONTRACTOR for my home.  I was speechless, what kind of business treats a customer who's been with them for 8 YEARS?  I fumed about this because here I thought that my house was under a warranty for the month of December and only to find out that it was not.  I called back and spoke to Rachel and she told me everything the first idiot told me, also suggested I find another contractor.  I sent a letter to them telling them my feelings and also telling them that in the past 8 years I've read plenty of bad reviews but since I never was treated bad I disregarded. In my letter I explained how I would be more than happy to find another contractor and would now put in a bad review.  I did a lot of research and found another company who was rated in Las Vegas as one of the top 10 company's and set up a new contract.  Best part same service a lot cheaper per year and a lot cheaper per visit.  I would highly recommend that NO ONE use this company.  With an office staff like that they deserve to be put out of business."
"3","Let me start by saying I'm no authentic German food expert at all.  So I don't know how authentic the dishes are.  I like the food pretty well.  Have gone there multiple times.  Love their German potato salad and red cabbage.  \n\nThat being said, they get only 3 stars because they are way over priced (go during 2 for 1) for \""doctored\"" dishes.  I asked if they make the potato salad and cabbage from scratch and was told no, that it would take too much preptime and that the cook \""doctors\"" them from premade.  Also our desert was frozen and had to be heated, so not fresh there.  For the prices they ask, they should take the time to prep food from scratch.  But I do still like the taste, they doctor well to me.\n\nAlso, our last visit the table clothes under glass top were dirty and our waitress was rudish and rushing us."
"1","Wish I had seen these reviews before going. I will keep it simple. In my opinion this place is a total rip-of as far as the prices charged and the quality/authenticity of the food served. I must say the portions were large, but i guess they have to get rid of the stuff somehow."
"4","Love this place! First came here in 1996. It's vegan friendly and oh so good. Last night I had the amazing papaya salad and fresh spring rolls. The rolls were mintier than I've had before, but still delicious. I had dinner #3 which came with a tasty fried roll, coconut soup with mushrooms and a garlicky oil on top (forgot the Thai name) and pad thai. Delicious except that the pad thai was too spicy even though I requested mild. It's the first time I've ever had spicy pad thai. The service was fast and friendly. I will go back for one of their awesome lunch specials."
"4","We usually go to Lotus of Siam - in the same seedy center.  Don't let the outside fool you.  Both places offer great Thai food.  I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of food at Komol.  Everything was great - we started with the coconut soup.  We also had the spring rolls.  Great appetizers.  Main courses we selected was a seafood curry dish and the basil, chicken fried rice.  Both dishes were really good.  When in Vegas - a place to go."
"4","We ended up at Komol when we couldn't get into Lotus of Siam and it turned out to be a satisfactory alternative. Komol is a Thai restaurant in the same shopping center as lotus of Siam. It's highly regarded as one of the better vegetarian and vegan restaurants in Las Vegas, but we got meat dishes and generally they were quite good.\nWe started with an egg roll or whatever they called it. It was deep fried but may not have contained egg. Nice and crispy on the outside and good flavor on the inside. Next up was the chicken coconut soup. This is always so different in so many restaurants. There was lots of spicy red powder floating at the top of this soup. They're pretty serious about the zing here at Komol. I can't really rank it among my chicken coconut soups. It might be near the top. I have to have it again.\nThen came the beef salad, which for me was the only disappointment of the night. While the beef was tasty, several pieces were really tough to chew. The tomatoes also seemed like the supermarket tomatoes that ripen on the truck on the way to delivery. \nThe two entrees we split were both excellent. I ordered the mixed seafood in panang curry and it was all good. All the seafood seemed fresh and was not overcooked. The curry had great flavor and precision. Ted ordered the beef basil in a brown rice and it was also nicely done with a great mix of flavors. \nCorkage was $5 a bottle."
"5","It's been a while since I've updated my review for Komol, so here we go. \n\nThe food is still delicious! I finally got to try the herbal salad, since I'm attempting to eat healthier lately. It was refreshing and absolutely delicious. It had just the right amount of spice and the texture was delicious. My dining companions got the mee krob to start and the spicy mint chicken, pork pad thai and some chicken dish that escapes me at the moment. All were incredibly happy with their meals. I took some garlic fried rice with beef home to my fella as well. I took a few bitefuls of that as well and love it!\n\nThe service can be hit or miss here, but they were extremely attentive on this visit and refilled our water glasses regularly. They were pretty packed for the holidays and seemed to accomodate the large amount of guests quite nicely. Definitely still one of my favorites!"
"3","I love Thai food and when I read about this, I was so excited to try it! The price is great and the staff is great! The only thing I did not like was when my main dish came out, it was cold. The food itself was just OKAY. The texture of the chicken was a bit rubbery, definitely not all breast meat.  I am the biggest panang consumer in all of Las Vegas, and I immediately noticed the panang recipe here is much different than most other Thai restaurants. Not my favorite here. Yet, our Phad See Ew noodles were rather enjoyable. Vegetarian options are available. On a side note, I did like their custom engraved menu covers. Hieroglyphic style Komul engravings on real wood. Cool!"
"4","Uh oh, what do we have here?  Another contender in the commercial center district looking to claim the prize of best Thai food in Vegas.  Everyone knows about the other contender.  What I was not aware of, prior to this visit for a mid day impromptu lunch redemption, was that Komol lays out some seriously good Thai food.  \n\nSo here I was, far from my comfort zone again trying new and exciting entrees that I would have never even thought of trying before. My arm was twisted twice this day...once to go here in the first place (glad I did) and the second was to try a dish with tofu.  What?!!? No meat!  I now know what the big to do is all about.  The meal went like this...Fresh spring rolls that were delicious and unlike others I've had, not greasy.  Pad kee mow with tofu, spicy level 3 since I'm a baby.  This dish was quite tasty...at first I skirted around the tofu; then I believe I compromised it all and refused to share it.  The final dish was Panang curry with chicken; finally the meat makes its presence known...level 3 again.  \n\nSorry to all experienced Thai foodies, my pallet cannot yet handle the crazy spiciness; with time I will slowly increase this to a 10 and just know that over the next few visits I will be updating this review to a 5.  Thanks for a great meal."
"2","Disappointing overall.  Spring rolls were unpleasant.  Poor flavor and texture.  Vegetarian massaman curry was okay.  Good spice, overly sweet."
"4","5 stars for the food! 3 stars for everything else.. This will be the spot I take all my out-of-towners if they are craving some Thai food!\n\nI had some family that were visiting and they were in the mood for some quality grubbing. After doing a quick search on the yelp, I was intrigued by this spot. Following the recommendations of the yelp squad, we quickly made our way over here from the hotel where they were staying.\n\nWhen we arrived here, there was a short 10 minute wait. The atmosphere is very quaint. The first thing I noticed as we were escorted to our booth was that the seats are in desperate state of disrepair. I literally sunk half a foot into them. We received our cool engraved menus and proceeded to order. The suggestions from previous yelp reviews were imbedded into our minds, and helped us tremendously. \n\nFood wise, it was probably some of the best Thai, ever. And I truly mean that. The spice level that we asked for in each dish was exactly on point, something that has never happened to me except at LoS. That says a lot.\n\nHerbal Salad - believe the hype, for it is real. This is a *must order* item! I don't know if this their signature dish, but it should be. It's a very unassuming plate.. but aren't a lot of great dishes the same way? After taking in that first spoon, it was love at first bite. The textures were amazing. Apples, crunchy tofu, lemongrass, and much, much more. I'll leave it to you guys who've never tried it, to experience it for yourselves. You won't regret it.\n\nDrunken noodles - they killed it here as well. I was mystified how they were able to add all that flavor into each rice noodle. It's pretty crazy. It was as if the sauce and spices were made into the noodles. A stunner!\n\nMango sticky rice - the mango was perfectly ripe, and tasted how a real mango should taste like. The sticky rice was sticky-icky! It also wasn't cloyingly sweet, and complimented the mango brilliantly. Another winner!\n\nThe panang curry and tom yum soup were excellent and items that I would highly recommend!\n\nBut, like in many operations, service kind of destroyed a great meal. Our server was gracious, kind, and helpful. But asking two servers to run a full restaurant, taking orders, running their food, and bussing their tables is just asinine. I know that the business is trying to cut costs, but as the great Chris Carter says \""C'mon, man!\""\n\nService aside, I would happily come back here because the food is that good. I shall see you on that flip side!"
"1","This is a disgusting place which serves a what looks like an hour by hour hotel room.  Don't do it!!!!!!   The staff creepy....like something out of psycho.  Beware!!!!"
"2","Hey I went into this place after reading all the raving reviews.... gotta say was disappointed with the people in it. I walked in and their doors have a chime to let them know ... someone came up to see and did not even say hello nothing. Then 3 to 4 minutes later another patron walks in young blond etc and I suddenly hear him greet her and ask if she would like any help. He also asked another lady who was in the same room if she needed help..\nThese 2 men walked around and not once was i asked for assistance. I am in the healing industry and was very keen to purchase some items....\nThe store was not as impressive as it was made out. And if you are in the business of selling these items keep an open heart and a welcoming presence."
"5","Absolutely awesome!  My husband and I have been talking about getting tattoo's (matching) for some time and while we were in Vegas decided to do it - OMG, some of the people on the strip are on crack with the prices - absolutely nuts!  Pay the $10 and grab a cab (they are down by the Stratosphere) so worth it!  We had Derrick - what a great job he did!!  This was my first tattoo and my husbands I don't know but he agreed best place.  I forget the guy's name from the smoke shop next door but he was hysterical - talked to us the whole time.  HIGHLY Recommend - prices are great for Vegas (well, for anywhere really), you can't go wrong!"
"5","The Center recently moved from a tiny, sort of run-down location to a brand-new, absolutely beautiful building. With the move, The Center is still providing their appreciated services to the community, and can now expand to offer even more.\n\nAt The Center, anyone can get STD testing for free, no matter your sexuality. The process is fast with short wait times, and everyone is incredibly professional and nice. They can even draw blood without hurting you or making you cry, as I'm afraid of needles - mega perk. It's hard to beat staying safe for zero cost out of pocket.\n\nOn the other side of things, The Center offers free computer use and internet access, and now has a growing library that people can use for free. They offer support meetings, throw fun fundraising events, and specifically make sure kids and teens have a private, \""just them\"" space to call their own. I also hear they have a bomb cafe for lunch.\n\nThe Center is doing great work for the Vegas community. Get tested!"
"1","I was a great fan of this location since it's right next to my place until the unthinkable happened.  They delivered bad service.  The table was full of crumbs when we were seated.  We ordered tea and not only was the spoon still in the tea but it has cheese on it.  When we told the manager all we got was, \""i'm sorry.\"" No kind of gasp of OMG, how did this happen.  Not even a real sincere apology.  This really sucks for me because I love PIE."
"2","So I went back to Las Vegas Uniforms to return my purchases because I decided to be a sexy cheetah for Halloween instead of a sophisticated doctor (lol). When I initially made my purchases I specifically asked the clerk about their return policy just in case, and she said that I could return everything for a refund as long as the items were clean, unused/unworn with the tags still attached and the original receipt within 60 days... check! I went up to the counter and presented the items to the clerk for a refund (it was a different lady this time). She asked me what was wrong with the items so I told her there was nothing was wrong, I'd just decided not to wear them for Halloween. She barely let me finish my sentence before she said with a snotty attitude, \""we don't do refunds for Halloween.\"" Mind you their return policy is in bold letters on the receipt and at the front counter and NOWHERE does it state no refunds for Halloween purchases. Not only that but I had verbally asked the lady I checked out with before purchasing about their return policy and there was no mentioning of this. Besides, it's none of their business what I'm buying it for!? Either you accept returns or you don't.\n\nThe clerk talked over me several times trying to make a point. She was soo rude! So I simply repeated, \""I want a refund because that's not what the person I bought it with said.\"" She said she was gonna go to the back and talk to management. Meanwhile there was a small line forming behind me. I felt bad for being \""that customer\"" but in short, I ended up getting a refund. She tried to act nice at the end of the transaction. Please!!! One of the worst customer service experiences I've ever had. I've worked in hospitality for a while so I have high expectations for guest service. I wish I WOULD act the way this lady did! Of course this doesn't change the fact that their selection is great but their customer service is trash!!! Just like the yelpers before me stated..."
"4","The staff here have been pleasant and the selection isn't bad, limited mainly to Korean goods with a few Japanese products as well [natto, umeboshi & miso]. After a couple of minor problems during check out one day they gave me a free package of a brown rice tea, which I thought was a sweet touch. Since I'm not familiar with a lot of Korean foods, there are a lot of things that I haven't tried or don't know what to do with yet, but they have a lot of Japanese foods that I use often and with a decent selection. Ponzu, mirin, a moderately large selection of natto [compared to other stores around town], mandoo/gyoza/potstickers, large selection of seaweeds in small and bulk, noodles, Soju...plus they have a large area with produce [not always the freshest looking], pre-made side dishes, kimchee/kimchi, another section with beauty and hygienic products, cooking supplies,  and a fresh eat-in or take-out kitchen. I've yet to try it but it looks promising. Sometimes the owners will be there. Last time I went they were and their children were running happily through the store. Not sometime I particularly mind, but could hold the potential to be annoying."
"3","For a neighborhood market, I think this place is decent. Somewhere to go on your way home from work on school, that isn't a major detour or large shopping trip.\n\nThis place has your essential Korean (and other Asian) goodies. They have household items, nonperishables, frozen, and fresh. They do not have a fresh butchery, but do sell frozen meat at affordable prices. They also have a small fridge of banchan, though the last time I went I thought the selection of banchan was not as good as before."
"2","Kicked it here for a couple hours last Saturday. It was $10/hr for a regular table and $1/hr for the quarter operated smaller tables. We played by the hour. The two types of tables are mixed together throughout the place and are pretty beat up. The aren't enough cues or triangles for every table. The two cues that we were able to find were hella crooked. \n\nThe bar had $8/domestic and $10/import pitchers. The waitress was nice and comes by to check on if you need more drinks quite often."
"5","Having been a customer of Tower of Jewels for about 35 years or more I was Yelping and decided to take a look at what people say about the business.  I was shocked at the love/hate Yelps.  This business is probably the most reputable business of ANY kind in this city and owned and operated by its owner, Jack Weinstein....who takes the utmost pride in his and his employees work and customer service. He and his business are part of the history of our city.  Who's Who of past and present are his clientele but treats even small potatoes like me like we are special.  Through the years I can not even begin to tell you the wonderful things I know personally of that this man has done for people and the community.  And to those who say bad things about how they were treated....I think you might want to look in the mirror.  Usually people get treated like they treat others but in the case of Tower of Jewel employees that is not the case.  Mr Weinstein insists on and gets the best attitudes from his employees...they may not kiss your behind but you will get good, quality service no matter what demeanor you display.\n\nAs for the security guard....how great is that to have someone their to look after your safety while shopping for valuable items or bring them in for repairs.  \n\nAs for shopping center jewelers...I am not bad mouthing them.  They have their niche.  But for a quality, long term relationship with a jeweler....choose Tower of Jewels for your family and stick with them.  You will not be sorry.  It is not too late, start now.  Take your items in to be cleaned and checked....have a battery put in your watch...start small....I think you will be more that pleased that you did....tell them I told you to come in for that service....my name is Connie....they just Rodium plated a junk jewelry pendant my husband bought me a long time ago when we had no money for the real thing....it looks like million bucks!  And they treat us like a million bucks too."
"1","Let me start by saying that I wouldn't recommend there services here.they charge you for everything I booked my wedding on May 9 th unfortunately we can't get married here so I canceled they said they can't refund my depost because of the service they had to do planning all I did was email questions and I didn't have a big package I had the simplicity package it's not much to it. I would be happier getting married at a courthouse then here"
"3","For those of you who don't live in Vegas, this is the company that picks up your trash and recycled items.  In the 17+ years I've lived here, they only get 3 Stars from me.  Here's why:\n\nPROS\n- They pick up trash on holidays.\n\n- They never miss a scheduled pickup day.\n\n- They will pickup trash up to 6 feet long.\n\nCONS\n- They pick up the recycled items later in the day, which can make the neighborhood messy if it's a windy day.\n\n- They always leave the trash can in the street instead of near the sidewalk.  Sometimes, they leave the trashcan at the neighbor's house next door.\n\n- They sometimes leave some trash in the can.\n\nOverall, it's not bad.....bottom line, there's no other option, so I'll have to live with it!  Thanks @Misti Y for the inspiration to review the trash guys!"
"2","At least twice per month Republic Services skips picking up my trash. I've complained five or six times now and they always send out a truck to pick it up, but I shouldn't have to call. I think it may be due to people parking in front of my trash can, but I can't help that. I live across from an elementary school and it is a public street. I've seen better service in a park. \nFurthermore, when my trash is emptied, I find the can in the middle of the street, which is kind of stupid considering I rent the can from them. They have to replace it when it gets run over! I am currently fighting with them to pick up my trash from Thanksgiving (note the date of this review)!!  After four calls, it was finally picked up on Tuesday night, but they only took half of it. Why? Now I'm calling them again on Wednesday to get them to pick it up, but my regular day is Thursday. Chances are, they may pick it up tomorrow on the regular pick up day. \nIf I was that slow to respond to the bill, they would file a lien on my house! I wonder if I can file a lien against their building...."
"5","Amazing company! The best one in Vegas!"
"1","Horrible customer service!!! I missed one 1 in my account number to pay my bill and I was charged 25.00 for entering the wrong account number!!! I called thinking I have been here paying for over 5 years now and have never done that. Surely they will credit the 25.00 for the typo. Oooo no!!! Bend over and have to take it! Along with all the trash left on the street when they dump the trash!! PLEASE SOMEONE OFFER US ANOTHER OPTION!!!!"
"5","The food is very fresh.  The service is great.  The resturant is one of our favorites.  We have been there about once a month.  It's not so easy to find.  Behind some buildings that are on Sahara.  But worth it.  Everyone I take there sayes it could be the best Shushi in America!  I went there because of the good reviews on Yelp and am glad I did.  Had Tuna, Salmon, Eel, California rolls, Halibit, Shrimp, Mushrooms, Soup, Salad and Beet sherbert.  Sake was great has Lots of Beers and so full I had to waddel out....Had seconds on Tuna and Salmon."
"5","Insanely good find!\n\nWe were visiting from out-of-town and staying on the strip, but decided to check out something a bit outside the \""normal\"" zone. This place was rated highly on Yelp, and so a taxi-ride later ($20), we were there. Where \""there\"" is exactly is hard to say for us, and we had to look around to find the exact location of the place (it's in the middle \""island\"" building on the right). It's located right in the middle of some Korean restaurants, and is definitely not your standard \""strip\"" business - it's not at all notable from the outside.\n\nThe inside is another matter. We chose to sit at the bar to watch the itamae at work, but we liked the set up of the tables and the main room. I was immediately intrigued by the aquariums in the back that housed live flounder, prawns, and abalone. I inquired about the abalone (it wasn't on the menu), and was a bit taken aback at the price ($25), but ordered it anyway due to the fact that we were on vacation, and I couldn't recall ever seeing it on a menu before. It was fantastic - very nice, firm, texture and a very oceany- (almost uni-like) taste.\n\nI decided to have some of the prawn, too (also not on the menu), and was very pleased with that, too. They serve the prawn raw, first, and after you've had the tail, they then tempura-fry the head. It was extraordinary!\n\nWe had some other dishes, too: some of them ordered by us, and some of them presented to us by the owner (we ordered a few things that weren't in-stock, and I think it was a very nice and appreciated gesture). Everything we had, from start to finish, was just excellent: fresh tako, hamachi, and unagi sushi, and a HUGE \""special\"" maki roll. The sake was good, and reasonably priced too. I was so full by the end of the meal, I couldn't fit any uni, and that's a first for me!\n\nThe only (very minor) complaint I have is that they didn't have closed-captioning on the TV's. \n\nI highly recommend this place for anyone looking for a fantastic meal of sushi in Vegas.. It doesn't have the ambiance of a Tao or Koi, and it's not a teppenyaki place, but that's not what I'm looking for in a sushi restaurant anyway. We spent over $50/person (because we wanted to..the food was GOOD!) but could just as easily have spent $25/person if we wanted to be more wallet-conscious.\n\nWe'll definitely be going back the next time we're there!"
"3","Went here with my visiting family for the first time about a month ago...\n\nThe food is pretty good and I must admit, I ordered something a little obnoxious. I had the Tokyo Deluxe which is a little of everything (seriously...just about EVERYTHING) and a cup of tea.  \n\nWhile the food I ordered was good, some of the items my family ordered weren't quite up to par. The size of the portions were good but the flavor just seemed a little off on a few of the items.\n\nI'm sure there are other things that taste really good on the menu and I'll update this review when I have a chance to go back."
"4","A nice old school Sushi restaurant. Very relaxed feeling, not the uppity type place where you feel not worthy of their time. Very good sushi and very good prices. The chefs were very entertaining and fast. Saki bombs are always best when shared w/the chefs! Soju shots can really sneak up on you!"
"2","We have been eating here for the last 7 years during CES.  It was always amazing.  We always looked forward to it.  However, the latest reviews I read prior to dining here the first week of 2013 indicated a decline in standards.  Unfortunately, I have to agree with those reviews.  The sushi was still very tasty.  Seafood still nice and fresh. The presentation was still gorgeous. The art of sushi as it affects quality is on the downhill slide.  The rolls were somewhat sloppy.  About 50% of the pieces fell apart when we tried to pick them up.  If they continue with this, they'll be forced to serve the sushi with a spoon. The edamame, Shumai and miso soup were all served at barely above room temperature.  A huge disappointment for such simple principles. Hot food- hot.  Cold food- cold.  As usual, the service was great and all the staff is very charming.  It makes me sad to think that we'll likely have to find a new sushi joint for next year."
"1","Senator Harry Reid is a moron!!! \n\nThat's it. \n\n-10 stars\n\n\n\nUpdate:  I guess only one person here is aloud to have an opinion. Actually I was born and raised here in Las Vegas. So the fact that you are a die hard democrat makes my opinion uneducated. No the fact that Harry Reid puts so much time and effort into trying to get Yucca Mtn. stopped instead of embracing it is where I am coming from. So because of his continued fight to stop something that is unstop-able we are now not in control. Since it is not being used as it is supposed to the Fed Gov owes some $300 million  per year for not fulfilling it's contract. ( wasting even more money ) If we had chosen to accept it we would have had the upper hand and demanded money for our roads and railways to be improved. They have spent so much money on Yucca Mtn. that there is no way it will not be used. By the way I have been there ( just before you assume to know who I am again )"
"1","The worst customer service ever. I brought my daughter here to find a dress for a sweet 16 Party. We found a gorgeous dress but unfortunately both ladies ignored . The Lady on the sales floor watched us but never attended to us while the other Lady stayed in the back. Beautiful dresses  ,  however when spending money I'd prefer customer service to be attached to the \""SERVICE\"". \nNO STARS !"
"1","These people were too stupid to send a bill to the correct address and then after getting the correct address, were too stupid to send me the bill for another FOUR MONTHS. I guess I underestimated how difficult it can be to use a computer to type out a bill and actually mail it out.\n\nAlso, Randy seems to think the best way to have people people pay a bill they've never actually received is to insult them and ask if they're too poor to afford $70. Well, Randy, it's very difficult to pay a bill that you and your client are too incompetant to send out.\n\nFYI, I have yet to receive an actual bill. All I've received is a letter stating the amount due with stickers and stamps on it. Good job. I can see the four months of hard work you put into this."
"4","Love it here. Classic Filipino cuisine. ok service average decor. Good star rating for its quality of food."
"1","Auto Unlimited is the worst car dealership I have ever had to deal with. They break the law and the owner is a terrible person. I bought a car that pulled to the right, during the purchase I told the salesman that I would not buy the car if it pulls to the right. So he assured me that they would take care of it. After they looked over the car twice the problem was not fixed and the owner said tough shit I am not helping you. The car also has a DTC for a sensor that came on 2 days after I bought the car. I checked and they cleared the code right before I bought the car. THAT IS AGAINST THE LAW!! Never ever go to this dealership, They lie just to get you to buy a car."
"1","Don't go there!\nI had my surgery a few months ago.  It was a horrible experience for me and because of their mistakes, I had to not only take more time to heal, I lost my job.  The guy who was to help me out of bed and get me to walk pulled my gown so hard and tight that he pulled my drainage tube 95% out the day aftery surgery...he was non apologetic, he just didn't care..and the nurse that came after our walk was in shock as to what he had done. She ran to get the head nurse because I bled all over my bed...the fear was that there may be an infection because of what he had done.  It caused me to ruin my furniture when I got home because I wouldnt stop bleeding/draining. My bed and coutch were ruined. While I was at the hospital, When I needed a nurse I would push the button...but rarely did they come when I called, I learned that if I crawled out of bed to the bathroom, there was an emergency button there that I could push and they would come running..   The nurses are overworked and hostile..the environment is non caring...I was treated as if I was an inconvenience. I was not treated as a person who just had MAJOR surgery, I was treated as if I was a 3 day stay at a cheap hotel.  The cleaning staff went through my things when they thought I was asleep, they even sat and watched TV.  The nurse who took me off my drip, forgot to put me in manually for my pain medicine every few hours, by that afternoon I was in sooooo much pain.  The head nurse and the AM nurse argued in my room over this.  My surgery was lumbar fusion, so I was cut on the front and back sides of me...it was painful to say the least.  I got my morning pain medicine at 8am, and got my next dose manually that evening.  it was horrible. Lets talk about food.  When laying in a bed, if there is a tray put on the rolling tray holder you cannot see it.  Some Blonde with a major attitude the 1st morning after my surgery walked into my room and and quipped \""Oh, not hungry or are we just on a fat loss regime today?\""  I was not at all happy with her comments, 1st of all, I didn't even know food was up there, no one told me food had arrived...because of my oxygen tube I couldn't smell. She had no right to make a rude comment which made me feel Fatter than I already am... later that afternoon more food came, she just dropped it on the rolling tray holder, then pushed it away against the wall while she straightened up...then left!  I pushed the nurses button for over an hour, finally when they arrived the nurse brought over the tray.  COLD mush is NOT an option...COLD coffee..no offer to get fresh food...I ended up not eaying till 2 days after my surgery...The STAFF does NOT care!  I wrote a detailed letter to the CEO, Head Nurse and the hospital administrator after I got home.  The CEO responded back to me a few weeks later apologizing and saying he will make sure there is more training for the nurses and staff. That's it??  Never offering to replace my furniture, or asking me what the hospital could do to make things better for me.  \nNow a few months later, I am healing, but I have no job to look forward to returning to because my FMLA ended too soon for me.  I spent over 2000.00 for new furniture. Both of these things would not have been an issue had the staff been attentive and not reckless.  I have heard from many people that they also had bad experiences at Valley Hospital.  I wish I would have known this beforehand.  I would have chosen another hospital to care for me.  After all....it's about a healthy life.\nps...there was an intern there who was very sweet, and even ran to the cafeteria to get me a cold diet coke...she mentioned that she may quit soon because she didn't want to become a hostile nurse like the ones who had been caring for me.  She was very afraid, and I wish her the best in her decision."
"3","Breakdown of Broadway Pizzeria: \n\nFOOD: \nBroadway Special (Pepperoni, Green Peppers, Mushrooms, Sausage, Meatballs - omitted the olives and onions) - The pizza wasnt bad but it wasnt authentic NYC Pizza.  The crust could have been been a little bit more crisp but I think what it really was the topping.  It need that cheesey gooey-ness that normally eat when you take a bit and have that cheese string still connected to the slice... and that didnt happen.\n\nSERVICE:\nThe staff was really friendly and always made a point to check with us to make sure we had everything we needed.  I did think it was odd that each table had the pizza stand but when we got our pizza they didnt use it - they used instead the folding tray stand which made it awkward for the third person in our group to get the food since it was furthest from him."
"4","We have ordered pizzas from here several times and have always been pleased. Nice Brooklyn-sized slices with fresh ingredients and homemade crust. I've never eaten in the restaurant, but it's always been a great place for takeout.\n\nTonight we thought we'd try something different, so we ordered other items off the menu. My husband had the Italian Combo sandwich, and I had the lasagna. We ordered these as to-go items, and they both traveled well in the takeout containers. The sandwich was flavorful, with fresh bread and a good selection of meat. The lasagna came with a side salad and an order of six garlic knots. LOVE the knots, and I can't imagine eating the pasta without them! I've had better lasagna, but this was pretty good for a storefront takeout -- and it was a LOT better than I could have pulled off at home. Plus the portion was big enough for us to have leftovers, and lasagna is always better the next day!\n\nI'm not a New Yorker by any means, but for this Nevada gal (by way of the Midwest and Texas), this is some pretty tasty Italian fare. (Better than Pizza Hut and Olive Garden, if nothing else.) Try the pizza, but don't be afraid to order off the menu."
"5","This place is a little far from my house, maybe a 15 minute drive, but if you like Sicilian pizza, I don't think you can find a better place in Las Vegas.\nI live in the east for a while, and I would rank this place's Sicilian pie right up there with pizza places in the east.\nThe place is small, but accommodating nonetheless.\nThe staff is extremely friendly (my wife is always accusing the girls of flirting with me, so I can only pick-up their pizza and not stay there to eat it.\nThey offer drinks in there that you don't normally see in any eatery (e.g. Yoohoo, Sobe, etc.) which I think is neat.\nAnd, considering that I just now paid $20 for a Sicilian pie, that will probably make four meals for my wife and I, it seems reasonably priced.\nI don't know how much more I can say. Go there and see for yourself."
"3","Yep, gonna visit this place if you want a job in service here in Vegas. Pretty clean, nice building, helpful staff. Pretty quick in and out as well."
"5","This is the best Mexican food I've ever had! I literally have to drive across town to eat there! Great food and service!"
"2","First things first ... THIS IS NOT A REGULAR COSTCO! It's a \""business center.\"" \n\nI feel that this is very important to mention, because I was very disappointed when I came during my weekend stay in Vegas. My bf and I wanted to hit up Costco for a case of water for our room and to get alcohol for a friend's bday gift.\n\nNO ALCOHOL SOLD HERE. Although, they do sell tobacco if you're into that kind of thing. \n\nNO FOOD COURT. But, why would you want a food court when you can eat at all the delicious food places and buffets on the strip?! \n\nAs I mentioned, this is a business Costco so you'll definitely find lots of snacks and drinks for vending machines. They even sell vending machines here! I did enjoy the fact that they had a huge array of drinks (juices, sodas, sparkling water, cider, etc.) It was quite impressive. \n\nAll in all, this Costco was pretty depressing. Very few workers ... workers that don't really know their stuff. I asked the guy checking memberships at the front if they had any coupon books and he said the guest/member service would have some. Waited in line and it turns out ... THEY DON'T EVEN ACCEPT THE COUPONS HERE. \n\nI'll definitely be shopping at the Costco back in L.A. before heading out to Vegas next time.."
"4","Raul is a really friendly, helpful fellow. He helped me and Walter as we perused the store for something sweet, simple, and just perfect for an anniversary gift for the two of us. Walter and I had been looking at all kinds of things, earrings, chains, pendants, bands, cocktail rings, all kinds of sparkly things. There was glitter in our eyes for days. They have a wonderful selection of rings and all kinds of pretty things. I'm glad we stopped in, although we never did decide what to get. At least we met Raul. He says he'll remember us so the next time we visit, he'll be able to re-show what we'd looked at before. I thought that was awesome, the confidence that he has in the brand and in the quality...to \""know\"" we'd return. Cool guy. THANKS RAUL (SKU 14242051 sz 7)"
"1","I really liked him at first......but then I upset him by walking out of the office after 2 hours of waiting and being told \""you are next\"" by his staff. I tried to explain to him on my next visit that I have to leave work to see him and although I completely understand that emergencies (and deliveries!) come up unexpected, I just need to be told the truth by his staff so I can set the right expectations with my boss & with myself (um...pregnant woman in a doctor's office for 2 hours with no food..what?!?). Ever since then he has been rude, hasn't listened to my concerns, rushed me out of the office, and misdiagnosed me when I came to his office with pelvic pain. I really did like him at first, but it seems to me this doctor is one with quite the \""ego\"" and I messed with that. On to the next doctor"
"1","Our son has constant nose bleeds so his pediatrician's office referred us to dr.boyers. we got in for an appointment and we're shocked with the abusive and hostile manner in witch this doctor conducted himself. He was so rude yelling and screaming at our son who is autistic that my wife was contemplating calling the police. Bottom line is dr.boyers was distasteful and a sorry excuse of a doctor. His staff  is equally rude aswell."
"5","I love the sales here- sometimes, at an additional 50% off orange labels, sometimes, there are BOGO deals. I've gotten many gifts for my niece and nephews over the years (ok, the secret's out). I love the roxy brand (the one for the ladies), so I also shop for myself- love love love the dresses and board shorts; we go to Hawaii once a year, so it's the go-to brand for summer styles- the bright colors and catchy prints really defines the beach vibe. My husband also looks for clothing too. \n\nI really don't intend on shopping here, it just becomes too-good-a-sale-to- pass-up kind of situation. I pretty much go for the clearance racks. The regular prices are comparable to the regular store prices (agree with Michael C). In addition, I believe that there is a promotion in the Passport Booklet (free for AAA members & VIP Premium Outlets members). \n\nIf there are too many other people in the small store, it can feel crowded, since the racks are positioned pretty close to each other. It's not usual to bump people or to be bumped by people, but they're usually pretty nice about it. Many of the employees seem to be on the teenage or 20s set, but generally pretty nice and eager to assist. Limited fitting rooms in the back- sometimes there might be a wait. But there are benches for the waiting husbands (like mine).\n\nCool store, great brands, excellent clearance prices."
"2","Ok, this store has a great selection of products.....however, the service here sucks, which is why I gave it 2 Stars.  I would have given it 1 Star but the selection of products bumped it up to 2 Stars.\n\nWas shopping with my son for a pair of shoes and had to ask for assistance.  There were 3 people working within 10 feet of us and none of them came up to ask us if we needed any help.  Meanwhile, my son was trying on shoe after shoe.....he tried over 10 pairs of shoes and still no help from anyone.\n\nWe finally found a pair he liked and went to pay for it.  It was about 30 minutes until closing and there was a line of about 20 people and 4 cashiers.  When we got to the front of the line, I could hear one of the cashiers say really loud to another....\""Damn, where the hell did all this customers come from?!  Don't they have better things to do?\"".....now, she said this with contempt in her voice.  Clearly she wanted to go home right at closing, but with a store full of customers and a long line of PAYING customers, it was cutting into her free time.\n\nThat comment made me sick......in today's economy, she should be happy that they had a long line of people at the cash register!  Ungrateful.....she doesn't understand the value of a customer.\n\nBased on her comments & the lack of customer service from the 3 lazy people who was near us and didn't offer help.....I've determined that it's not a one-off situation, but a regular problem with this store.  Clearly they don't know how to service customers.\n\nI wish my son would have found something he wanted at the Adidas store....they were very friendly and helpful.\n\nWill I return?  ~with a frustrated voice~ Only because there aren't more options for Nike Outlet Stores.....just the one on the South End of the Strip, which is inconvenient for me."
"5","The best store at these outlets!\n\nStrong selections across the board, everything Nike can be found here and the prices for some of the shoes are amazing.\n\nMy wife purchased some Nike running shoes for 25 bucks... they discounted 10% because there was a tiny speck of dirt on the shoes... that's great service! \n\nThe outlet is bigger than the others and is spaced out very well.  Plenty of help from the friendly staff and they ask you if you need help before you have to flag them down.  \n\nThe basketball shoes selection is decent, but the bread and butter belongs in the TSHIRTS!! Yesss!! 15 bucks a pop... and if you're like me, you'd love the motivating slogans.\n\nI purchased a \""MY FEET HURT FROM KICKING SO MUCH ASS\"" tshirt and chopped off the sleeves--needless to say I feel like a beast in the gym now thanks to the Nike Factory Store O_O.\n\nP.S. I actually really enjoy the temperature here too... it's not as cold as some of the other stores... that counts for something right?! HAHA."
"2","I'm a fan of LaCoste when I'm in the mood to look preppy with my polos, sweaters, and sundresses. \n\nThis store is tiny in comparison to the other stores I usually frequent. \n\nI didn't find the selection to be all that great, but I did find a really cute shirt to add to my preppy collection."
"3","It's a decent paper with great access to their writers. Plus, I really like the location! (They are located directly next to my office, so whenever I need something...I just walk over) \n\nIt also makes a great filler in my fire pit! Lol"
"1","I've been a customer since 1998.  Trying to cancel hardline telephone service in Vegas on a Monday evening.  I was on hold for 25  minutes.  Then the rep tells me they can't cancel my phone service unless I start paying for the modem or buy a new one.  Not renting a modem. Between both homes, I'm shelling out nearly 300 per month.  Guess I'll go ahead and cancel ALL my service.in Vegas and Phoenix."
"4","I love saving money!!  I was just browsing, and I did not expect to buy anything.  I found a deal that I could not pass up though.  I think that they normally have a buy 1 pair get the 2nd pair for half price.  I was able to get a pair of shape up shoes for $39.95 and a second pair of shoes for $14.97 (Orig. $44.95)!!  \n\nI used my shoes to go hiking at Red Rock Canyon later that week.  I haven't used the shape ups yet.  I probably won't need another pair of shoes for awhile....but if I do, then I will definitely go by here again."
"2","They have a variety of makeup lines but the selection of products was pretty scarce when I went in. The options they have for MAC, which was what I was shopping for, was really limited and most of what they did have was opened, broken, or looked really used. On top of that the customer service was terrible. The three employees working sat behind the register the entire time, no greeting or asking if I needed any help- which I did. Pretty disappointed. I'll be going to the indoor location next, hopefully there's a little more options."
"4","Although this store is often mobbed with people, I still don't mind sifting through the masses to find a killer deal. The best part is that they hand out coupons as you walk in. The coupons range from 30% to 50% off usually. This visit I was handed a 50% off coupon on handbags. If you like Coach, you'll love this outlet store."
"3","This outlet location is okay. I liked that they had mens, womens, and kids clothes. I went during winter and they had a good amount of sweaters and jackets. The prices were reasonable but the store was pretty disorganized. Not a bad place to shop if you already know what you're looking for."
"2","This place is overstaffed, and in fact right when you walk in there is no warm welcome to the store. Everyone who works there is busy. Sadly my experience here was dissapointing because they didn't have what I was looking for. \n\nThe store seems to be under construction. There was a bum in the music section just playing his little heart out on the piano, all intoxicated. (felt uncomfy)\n\nThere is no variety of product. Service is poor."
"4","Staff at this facility are outstanding. The online registration was convenient and easy to complete. Eliminated the stress of sitting in the facility trying to remember the information. Registration was simple..the nursing staff was very helpful and considerate. From check in to check out-  everyone was pleasant and professional."
"2","Back after a few months and they still can't get these Americanos right .   How hard is it?"
"1","I never knew how incompetent they were till I tried another doctor...My insurance changed so I had to go down the street to another doctor for the yearly exam.. I'm 50 years and have started to wear progressive lenses as well as contacts.  I spent thousands of dollars with these crooks on eye exams as well as contacts and glasses.  Come to find out, I was given a prescription that wasn't even near what it should have been!  FOR YEARS   No wonder why I couldn't see!  My daughter who went to a new doctor in RENO, the same thing.  The doctor that examined her said that she was being over prescribed.  Both of us were patients of Dr Lorenz  for at least 10 years.  As well as customers at the optical department there.  I brought my glasses to them today because my anti glare was chipping off after only about a year and a half, only to be told that they are out of the 1 year warranty.  They were gracious to tell me that I could have the lenses replaced but that I would have to pay in full another 298.00!!!  Oh and yes I would have to have a current prescription from one of their doctors!  lol...As if I would allow myself to be examined by any of the staff there ever again.  My readers from WALMART LAST FOR EVER and I just throw them in my purse, my 500.00 glasses I treat with the utmost care, they are no good due to the faulty material that they were made of!!!  Thank you NEVADA EYE AND EAR...is this why you changed your name  SAME PLACE SAME CRAP STAFF AND DOCTORS!  I hope OBAMACARE AND REVIEWS CAUSE you to go bankrupt!"
"2","Wow. The receptionist here is RUDE. I am not even visiting the doctor. I'm here with my grandma who is seeing the doctor. They were rude to her on the phone when she called, telling her that she would probably have to wait a very long time because Mondays are horribly busy in a way to make her feel bad. That rubbed me the wrong way. Why not inform her that there might be a wait rather than make her feel bad about it? \n\nOnce we got here, she didn't even have to wait. The only people in the waiting room were waiting for their wives who were seeing the doctor, not actually waiting to SEE the doctor. \nAs I'm sitting here, I heard the receptionist \nmake an outbound call to someone then complain to someone else in the office, threatening about how \""it's okay, they will just be sent to collections\"" as that will be his revenge on the client for whatever reason- all within earshot of other patients. \n\nI hope this doctor is worth the piss poor receptionist sitting behind the desk. \n\nI'm giving 2 stars since I've never seen this Doctor. I'd like to give one just for the guy behind the desk."
"3","My friends and I wanted to indulge in kid-like fun yesterday so we stopped by here around 9:00 pm.  Since it was one hour before closing the rides, the slide, and three of the four tracks were closed, which is understandable.  Luckily we were able to squeeze in two quick races at  the Sprint Kart track.  Each game was $7.00 each.  Each race lasted about 15 minutes each, but it felt much longer!  The inside where all the arcade games and the food court area was looked a little run down and dingy though."
"3","Took my two boys here (ages 8 & 9) on their spring break. It wasn't very crowded, which was nice.  We purchased 4 \""1 hour ride\"" passes for $22/each.\n\nThe employees were slow moving. Wasting our time, walking and working at a tortoises pace. My son stood in line to ride the solo cars, he was well over the red line; at least an inch over yet was told her was \""too short\"" and not allowed to ride. \n\nThe food was exactly what you would expect, greasy and over priced. \n\nWe had fun, but this place could be a lot better with a new set of employees."
"3","This store was pretty clean and had some pretty good deals, especially with several racks of red tag clearance items this past weekend. I had an issue with the checkout process, however, which is why I can't give them 4 stars. For buying only 2 items we were at the registers for what felt like 15 min because the associate couldn't figure out how to scan my items. I guess one of the stickers was messed up and wouldn't scan correctly....but rather than go and grab another one that had a good tag or manually key in the sku or numbers on the tag, she spent 5 min trying to peel the sticker and then stepped away without any explanation for 5-10 min and then came back with a new tag she had made for it. Hopefully she was just a new employee and next time this won't happen"
"1","My family went there for dinner for the first time tonight and it was a TERRIBLE experience. The service and the overall presentation of the restaurant were decent. The food, however, was so bad that everyone got a stomach ache. I think we all had food poisoning. The food was also either bland or very salty. We did not try the Mongolian grill section, so I cannot speak on behalf of that. Will I go back, no."
"1","This place doesn't even deserve one star!  It is absolutely disgusting!  Myself and my guest both got food poisoning from this place!  We went there on April 25, 2013.  Our sickness lasted for days!  Everything on the buffet was old, dried out and room temperature.  And omg....the bathrooms....wow!!!!  Absolutely disgusting!  The entire place was filthy.  I knew we should have walked out immediately!  Just from the smell inside the place.  Whatever you do.....remember....you are taking a very very big chance if you eat here!  I think it would be more likely than not....that you will end up sick!  We actually got staph food poisoning from here.  Otherwise known as \""Staphylococcus aureus bacterium\"".  I truly believe this place needs to be SHUT DOWN PERMANENTLY!!!"
"1","One star minus one star = zero stars!! Please let me help you if you are thinking about eating here: DONT! I am an avid connesieur of buffets and this place is a hot mess!! I was put off immediately by the uncleanliness but we proceeded, watered down crab, amnesia salad made with mayonnaise, mushy food all around...don't eat here ever, waste of money! They have a sign that says they wool"
"4","When I first came here I was amazed by how much food they were serving. It is a usual buffet so you can go and pick out which food you want to eat. They have many different varieties to choose from and they are all in their own section. The place was nice, clean, and their food signs really catch your attention. If you're a person who is really hungry and is craving many different kinds of food then I would definitely suggest  this place for you. You can even bring your family if you wish as their buffet prices are very reasonable. I have been here 3 or 4 times already and I have not regretted one of them."
"2","My mom treated us for my daughter's birthday here since it wasn't too far from my brother's home.  This was probably my least favorite of the Chinese buffets my mom has taken us to the past couple years.\n\nThe service was not too bad, but the selection wasn't as good as it could be and the foot just not as tasty.  Some foods seemed to have been sitting there for awhile, therefore, things that should be soft were hard.\n\nIt just wasn't as tasty as Krazy Buffet or the ones in the Phx area that we like.  The place had a nice ambiance, though, the tables were a bit high for those people who are shorter.\n\nThe taste just didn't make this place appealing to me to go back.  Thankful to my mom who treated us.  It was $13.95 per person for dinner and that included a non-alcoholic drink."
"1","4 years later, this place is still terrible. Why my mom likes to go here, ill never understand."
"1","My dad took his small Maltese here a few months ago and it was the worst experience ever! First of all his haircut was awful and they only accepted cash. But the worst thing is that our dog was traumatized! He was shaking the whole day and started limping as if he had been beaten. He also had some small cuts and was not his playful self. We almost took him to the vet but decided to wait to see if he would get better. The shaking stopped the next day but he limped for couple days. I don't know what they did to him but it seemed like they grabbed him to harsh and hurt his legs. Be careful in taking your pets here! Also, since they only accept cash you don't even have any proof of your visit!"
"1","Took a few different dogs here while we were fostering and the first time they did great. We took our dog back to get another haircut and they didn't do it anything like the first. We took him back a 3rd time and told them about the great job they did on the first go-around and asked them to replicate it. They didn't. They made a lot of notes on our card and when we brought him back a 4th time, they flat out told us to leave and said \""we weren't a good fit\"". The owner was practically hysterical, while we calmly told him that we weren't complaining, but just asking for them to recreate their first haircut. He told us that we were complaining. Apparently he knows more than we do, what we were trying to convey. We won't be back. We won't take any other foster dogs here. We won't recommend our foster friends return here either. What a huge mistake."
"3","It's not the Rio buffet, but it's fine for what it is: a decent salad and soup bar, especially at $6.49 a person.  I'm not sure what the previous reviewer expected for that price.\n\nFour soups, several pastas, and lots of salad items, plus pizza and potatoes.    Mushrooms could've been fresher, and soft serve was too soft.  On the other hand soft drinks (extra $) had free refills and you could take a refill with you."
"5","Ulta is quickly overtaking my love of Sephora since it is so much closer and so easily assisible. They are also beginning to carry more high end brands like Lancome and Benefit. I like that they have a better selection of salon hair products as well as the drugstore brands. NYX is sold here and often goes on sale for buy one get one half off. If you're a follower of beauty blogs you can appreciate the NYX brand as an inexpensive beauty find. This particular store is huge, which allows for plenty of room to meander and shop. The staff greet you as you walk in the door and are always willing to answer questions or look for out of stock items if asked."
"2","I actually really like this Ulta location - the people are always super friendly, it's not crazy busy, even on the weekends, and it's close to home. But after having two of the worst brow waxing experiences of my life at this ulta location, I can't in good conscience return and the 2 star rating is more than deserved.\n\nI recently moved to Vegas from Chicago where I was spoiled with the BEST brow waxers, ever!! So when I came to town, I started looking around for somewhere to make my new brow home. I came into this location by chance a few months back and decided to give their Benefit brow a try. My first wax was perfection - cleaned up my arches but left my healthy, full brows in tact. I was sold. I got the girl's card but sadly lost it before making another appointment. \n\nSo the next time, I called and tried to figure out who I had gotten the wax from last time. After talking to someone there, they said that the girl I was describing sounded like Corinne. So I made an appointment with her and made my way back in. But it was NOT Corinne and my wax was so bizarre I don't even know how to describe it. First of all, she spent a lot of time during my appointment checking out her own makeup in the mirror. It was so awkward. She was also a good 10-15 minutes behind schedule and seemed totally unconcerned about it. That might not be a big deal for her but when you have to call to schedule these appointments a day or two (at least) in advance, a little professional courtesy should be extended to try to keep appointments on track. But the worst part (obviously) was the wax itself. She didn't mess with the arch too much (which I appreciated) but she overly waxed the top of the brow, making them too thin on top and giving me an odd, constantly frustrated look. And she didn't seem concerned at all when I didn't look too happy....\n\nSo after a few weeks of letting them grow and cleaning them up at home by tweezers, I decided to give this location one more try with someone else. I called today to make an appointment and apparently there was nobody at the benefit bar. The girl apologized, kinda (although she really should have apologized for putting me on hold for at least 10 mins for someone she knew wasn't there) and then suggested I get my brows done in the salon - I believe by Frank. She assured me he was very good and booked me for an hour later. Once again, I was super disappointed. Frank (I think that's his name) was super nice but clearly did not know what he was doing. He took a good 10-15 minutes nervously tracing out my eyebrows in peach marker and repeatedly asking me if I was ok with what he planned to do. I suppose I should have gotten up right then and there and walked out but despite his obvious lack of experience, what he traced out seemed fine - there wasn't much that was supposed to be waxed off - so I went ahead and let him wax away. After he was done, he handed me the mirror and asked if there was anything he should fix (apparently brow waxing was either that novel to him or he knew he screwed up) and I couldn't even respond...my brows are the thinnest they have EVER been. There is almost no arch. They look like a thin line, almost straight across, not the archy, natural brows I have spent years perfecting. Yet somehow I feel like the blame is not all his here. Whoever is answering the phones at this Ulta and handing out brow advice should be subjected to a wax by everyone they are recommending because something tells me they wouldn't be so eager to recommend people like Corinne and Frank again. \n\nLong story short: my brows are ruined. It's going to take months to regrow my gorgeous brows and there is no way I'm ever risking return again."
"1","As usual Burger King is out of ketchup!! I wish I could give it some negative stars. The worst thing is that I've been to at least four other burger king's and have had the same problem with the ketchup, but I guess that's not as bad as the time when they ran outta buns!! You run a burger joint; how are you going to run out of the two essential things to run a burger joint?! Plus the bun is always two sizes too big for the patty. Just have sloppy made burgers. Worst chain ever!!!!"
"3","LOW LOW PRICES!! TODAY!! \n\nActually every day. \n\nYou're not going to Thai Grill for the atmosphere unless you really miss the atmosphere of your Grandpa's basement rec room. Light brown paneling rules the day here and it is completed by a couple TV's sitting up on a cabinet or table and red vinyl booths accented by occasional touches of almost matching duct tape. All it needed was a furnace, water heater and peg board wall filled with tools and the Grandpa's basement Thai restaurant illusion would be complete. \n\nSo what about the food you ask? Is this a legit hole-in-the wall find? \n\nI'm not quite sure. I had Mussman Curry with shrimp. I ordered it medium but would go hotter next time. The sauce was nice and flavorful and there were no remnants of curry flakes I have seen at other Thai places. It included shrimp, potatoes, carrots, onions and peanuts. The veggies were fine although some of them had a crinkle cut which I found oddly distracting in Thai food. The shrimp was good but a little chewy. Could be slightly overcooked or could be thawed too quickly: 2 methods with the same result, chewy shrimp. \n\nI also ordered Thai iced coffee. The server brought out Thai iced tea which I immediately started on. He quickly realized his mistake and brought out the iced coffee. I drank most of both and I actually preferred the Thai iced tea. It had a good earthy authenticity to it. Between the coffee and the tea my fingers are flying right now, BTW. \n\nThe total bill for this decent but not outstanding meal? $12.06. Solid. \n\nThere was steady call-in and drop by orders going to local repeat customers that they knew by name...generally a good sign. \n\nThe neighborhood is...well there is a security guard patrolling the lot after dark. I'll leave it at that."
"2","At first glance, the restaurant seems to be pretty well built with a. lot of nice, casual tables. Empty tables, except for the staff eating in the dining room. The first thing that catches my eye is the glass of water, lots of random floating white bits. This is not your usual dirty glass mind you, there were a substantial number of things on my glass and of my companion's glass.\n\nWe ordered a Thai Iced Tea since the water was no good. Fortunately this was clean, and tasted pretty good.\n\nFor entrees, we got Chicken Phad Thai, Pan Nang Beef, and Screaming Tiger.  The Phad Thai had decent flavor, and was quite plentiful for a lunch special under $7.  The Pan Nang Beef was quite different.  My companion asked for it mild but was still a bit spicy and grease was covering the top of the curry. It was quite poorly made and to date only one place in this city prepares it well.  The Screaming Tiger was decent.  Lightly marinated beef that was grilled to medium and sliced thin, served with steamed brocolli and carrots.  It had a tamarind soy dipping sauce (at least that's what it tasted like.)\n\nOverall, the experience was mediocre, and the total of the bill was about $30 for two people with 3 entrees and 2 drinks."
"2","I ordered the basil fried rice.  When I got home and opened it It was just regular  fried rice. I  took a look at the menu again just to be sure and  it did say that the basil fried rice only had  basil, onions, and chili.  My rice had tons of carrots, onions, broccoli and no basil.  I called to complain and the guy told me his wife says she put basil in it.  I mentioned that on the menu it doesnt say any of the vegetables came in it and I didnt want it. He pretty much waited me out with silence on that and I just hung up out of frustration.  The crab puffs had so much flling that they were just soggy wontons with stuffing overflowing from them.  I never thought Id be able to say that a crab pull had to much filling but they did.  I also ordered this as delivery but decided to pick it up because it was a two hour wait.  I was disappointed to see that they left the tip I was planning to give to the driver on my bill.  I didnt notice till later that night.  All in all it was a horrible experience.  I only give this place two stars because they do have very large shrimp and they were not greedy with them.  My husband thought they were okay.  Eat at your rown risk."
"2","Geek squad sucks, no customer service, no order or organization, horrible communication"
"3","The couple time I have come into this store have been for fish gear.  I bought a small aquarium, gravel, a net, some tank decorations, gold fish food, water treatment and a few comet goldfish.  Supply on hand is limited but the prices have been fair and even cheaper than Walmart in some cases.  But the friendliness of the staff has been hit and miss.  While wondering the isles I was passed by a few employees without so much as a howdoyoudo.  I was standing at the fish section looking at what would become my future pets and nobody offered assistnace even though there were two people staff members standing there.  I looked over at one and told him I need to get a couple of fish.  He hardly said a word and just scooped two without letting me choose.  I'm almost surprised he did not give me the first fish that he scooped that was swimming upside down.  He threw it back in the tank though it was circling the bowl and gave me a better one.  I gotta give him that.  It was the cashiers who were the most friendly and displayed the best customer service."
"1","Petsmart on Decatur.  \nMy husband and I always went to the Petsmart on the east coast so we decided to take our babies to the Petsmart here in Vegas where we moved to. At first they were all polite. Elsa would cut my himmilayian cat\n{The lion Cut} and Wendy would cut my pommerian {the lion cut} I saw a lady that had color on her baby so I decided to get it for my Pom. First color was purple. We got it on her tail. It was very fashionable. They always put a bow in her hair. The 2nd time\nI ask for blue. Wendy did a BAD job. My Pom had blue all over her. I ask for it on the tail and ears. It was sloppy. When my husband picked her up he said to Wendy she did a S....y job. She did not even bother to say let me fix it. When he brought her home I was pissed. So I called and talked with the Mgr. Betty she was nice and said bring her back and they will fix it. My husband could not because he was going out of the country the next day and I could not because I do not know how to drive.\nSo Betty said the next time she can get a free cut or she will give us our money back.\nWe took her up on that a month later. We talked to Elsa and told her what Betty said and she said ok. We always get the full package ie: nails cut shampoo ears cleaned\nTeeth brushed. All Wendy did was cut her and then she gave us a Pawgress Report stating that she did everything we always paid for. I talked with Elsa because she said she was the mgr at that time and I told her none of my babies will never be back. She simply said Sorry. So finally I talked with Betty. She said no one told her what happen\nAnd she was very sorry. But I will never bring my babies back. Usually my Pom is happy when she get groom but for some reason this time she was not. STRANGE\nThis was the Petsmart on Decatur"
"5","My mother-in-law sent us a package for Christmas and now we are hooked.  I hated how long it took to deliver though so we found a store on Rainbow in Las Vegas NV.  They honored all of the deals found on line.  This is the best meat and deserts I've ever had.  Lasagna is great too.  Highly recommend."
"3","Every Pick Up Stix is the same, so I knew what I was getting when I picked up food here: very tasty Chinese food.  I think their \""House Special Chicken\"" is unlike any other Chinese dish, so I usually get that.  Mixed with rice, that easily makes two meals for me.  While the food is good here, though, it's nothing amazing.  And I much prefer ordering from an independent Chinese restaurant, so I don't come here that often.  Definitely a top choice when shopping in \""Best In The West\"" and want to grab a meal after."
"4","Nice, fashionable clothing at affordable pricing just like any other Old Navy/Gap store. This store appears to be larger and better maintained than others I've been to. The employees are very friendly and helpful and there are always many of them around the store so it isn't hard to flag someone down if you need help. The cashiers at the front are quick and efficient, but expect a line if there's a good sale going on. This was the case the last time I was here."
"5","OK, so living in Las Vegas has taken some getting used to.  Especially the whole strip mall thing, which means lack of character to the shopping areas.  \n\nSo imagine my surprise when looking for a place to have dinner with out of town friends, that we pulled into a parking spot in front of Pin Kaow and walked through the doors and were transported into a beautifully elegant, dining experience.\n\nNot only is the restaurant beautiful, the staff is friendly, attentive, dressed in Thai attire.  And the food... OH!  The food.  It's wonderfully delicious!  My party and I had assorted curries and appetizers and nothing disappointed.  My San Diego friend, who is very finicky, LOVED his duck curry and had it again when we returned 3 months later.\n\nThis is definitely a little ray of sunshine in the land of strip malls."
"5","Love this place! Awesome food, something for everyone. You can order items to be spicy to very mild. The yellow chicken curry is to die for and so is the beef jerky. Always friendly and you can eat family style if you get several different items and share. Always busy weather it is lunch or dinner. I like to order over the phone and take out. They even know me by name & order. Could eat here every nite!"
"1","I guess I will write reviews of places I really like too because I think some of my reviews are being Yelp \""filtered\"".  I used to like this place, the food and the service.  The food is okay.  I have had better thai food however this is a convenient location for me. \n \nThe last 2 times I have been in I have been ignored for a while by service.  I am sure it wasn't on purpose but when 2 tables are seated after me and served drinks and their appetizers before the server acknowledges me, that is a problem.  \n\nThe first time I walked out, the second time I waived my hands in the air to make sure to get their attention.  We sat at the same table both times, it could be a cursed table.\n\nThe hostess is always very sweet and friendly.  However, I won't be back unless friends have a burning desire to go.  I heard a new thai restaurant opened that is even closer to where I live.  I will give that a go!"
"1","I have to say that I think I am over it.  I am from LA originally, and maybe I have just been spoiled by really good and cheap Thai food. When I moved to Vegas, this was my go to Thai spot, partly because someone recommended it and partly because there was not much else to choose from in our area.  Pin Kaow has some decent tasting food, but my biggest problem is that I feel like the portion sizes are getting smaller, and it is just not worth the price."
"3","Back in the day I used to come here a lot and since I was on this side of town I decided to stop by for lunch just like old times. The flavor of the food is still good and the staff is still pleasant. My only bad comment is that I swear their lunch portions got smaller, Just look at the picture I posted of the beef and broccoli, the scoop of rice is appropriate but c'mon, look at the main entree, it's too small. Like I said, I know it's lunch time but at other restaurants, you will and do get larger portions even if it is lunch, that's all I'm saying....."
"2","My family LOVES Thai food.  When we stepped through the door for the first time at Pin Kaow this past week, we were in awe of how cozy and beautifully decorated this restaurant was on the inside.  Here is what we ordered (our Thai favorites) and the consensus we came to on our overall experience:\n\n1. Tom Ka Kai soup ( A lemongrass soup with coconut milk, mushrooms , and chicken)\nIt was rich and delicious with just the right balance of flavors..  but extremely salty.. so much so we could not finish.  Had it not been so salty.. I think it would be the perfect soup.\n\n2. Nam Tok Salad (Grilled sliced beef, mint leaves, onion, basil, Thai spicy sauce)\nWe normally fight over the last portion of beef salad, but none of us cared too much for this particular salad.  Again it was overly salty and the portion was quite small.  Maybe a different salad would have suited our taste better, but there was something a bit overpowering .. not sure what.\n\n3. Chili Mint Noodles (Stir fried flat rice noodles, onion, chili peppers, jalapeno, basil leaves, egg, and your choice of meat (we chose shrimp)\nI would have enjoyed eating more of this, but there just wasn't enough of it because they were so stingy with the portions.. noodles don't cost very much.. \n \nWe've decided to keep looking."
"2","Chili's is usually our go to spot for a nice quick meal and maragritas which are awesome.  Our last visit however was pretty disappointing.  We ordered our usual, cajun chicken  pasta.  When we got our meal, which was a longer wait than usual, it tasted very salty!  So we asked the server for a side of alfredo sauce.  It took them even longer just for a side of sauce.  Finally when we got the sauce, put it on our food, it was cold!  So we just gave up on our meal and asked for our check, also advising our server that the food was super salty, and that the sauce was cold and we were not happy with what we were served.  She asked if we wanted anything else, of course we said no since we were already turned off.  She just gave us our check, didn't offer a discount or apology or anything!  So it was like she didn't care that we were not happy with our service.  That type of service was just unexpected but I guess it just wasn't the servers day."
"2","Crappy service. Good food..... Ordered, then got food 50mins Later then didn't see the Waitress for another 30 mins..... When she dropped off the check..."
"5","I have been here twice. A couple months ago I was looking through my Entertainment Book for ideas of what to do on a Saturday. I saw the coupon for Artful Potter and asked my spouse if she wanted to check it out. She was up for it, so we headed over.\n\nI didn't quite know what to expect. When we got there a lady said to pick out a piece and then she'd explain how everything works. I picked out a hippopotamus bank and my wife got two little plates. We sat down and the lady explained how to paint them.\n\nWe both really had a good time. In fact my wife said she wanted to go back every month! We were really excited to see what our pieces looked like. We were both very pleased with how they turned out.\n\nWhen my aunt was here a couple of weeks ago, I suggested that we go. My mom and aunt both said they didn't want to go. I kept trying to convince them they would have fun. Finally they relented. They both ended up having a good time and were pleased with their items when we picked them up.\n\nI definitely recommend checking it out."
"2","Food was okay, service was fine.. but got serious diarrhea shortly after leaving there (both of us did)... same thing happened last time we were there also.  The first time I wrote it off as a fluke, could have caught that bug elsewhere.. but two times?  Health Department is failing us here, and so is Tony Roma's."
"3","My sisters and I have been coming here constantly for the first week of my stay in Vegas. We were obsessed with the Mexican food for a while. I ended up actually liking tacos and the horchata and the burritos, but for some reason we just stopped going here. It was bomb af for a while, but then I guess I got more of this goodness in such little time.\n\nThere were flies everywhere that kept following my food, which made me sad..since I had to move around the whole restaurant to try to avoid them. Mostly in the afternoon lol.\n\nI have a relatively high tolerance rate, but it pushed me to the edge when we visited the restaurant at 2 am in the morning.. the woman was a bitchhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh tho! She lost her patience and put out her temper on me since I did not know how to pronounce half of the things I ordered -___- She even threw the plastic bag at my sister. Dirtyyyy!"
"5","THE BEST!!!!! Moved here from Cali, and this is one of the first places my sweetie took me to. Great service, AMAZING food, (better then what Ventura has to offer) clean, and affordable.\nFamily is coming in next week and I can't wait to take them here, yet sweetie is afraid they will never leave after they taste the delisiousness of this place! \nGO! You won't be disapointed!"
"3","I LOVE MEXICANS.... I MEAN MEXICAN FOOD!\n\nPepe's compared to Roberto's. \n\nPepe's knocks this one out of the ball park. The reason being the quality of food is way better. I want it to be known that the staff here is very friendly, maybe a little to friendly I had a guy in the back winking at me.\nAlso the first time I was here one of the employees actually asked me for my number, at that time (2010) I was single and to this day I still talk to him as a good friend.\n\nOverall you can order anything with the carne asada and it will be great. The carne asada is finely chopped and has very minimal fat. They season their meat very well, not to salty nor to bland. The add a side of beans and tortilla chips.\n\nThe only thing I would do different is keep the salsa station clean."
"1","We were excited to try Pepes carne asada fries as they advertise the best in Vegas!\nWe walked in to no greet as an employee mopped the.floor and the cook looked at us didn't say anything disappeared we waited for someone to come to take our order finally another lady comes out to do so. I didn't like how you can't see much of the cooking taking place.\n\nHighly disappointed we wasted over half of our food there were no beans as another user said bland guacamole no pico de gayo and CANNED CHEESE SAUCE!!! You've got to be kidding me!! There is absolutely NO comparison to Roberto's!!"
"5","First came here years ago with my mom and sister after leaving a club.  We were drunk but remember it being delicious.  Came back a week ago now that I moved back up to this side of town and it is still the same.  Great authentic food, a nice salsa bar in the middle, Coca-Cola products (THANK YOU!)...and decent sized dining room.  Great prices.  I'll be back!"
"5","My husband found a dog in bad shape late Saturday night, so I needed a vet that was open on Sundays. I found Lone Mountain Animal Hospital through a Yelp search, and they fit me in to their tight Sunday schedule. The entire office worked hard to make my nervous and timid new friend feel safe and at home. Dr. Beckes was gentle and so sweet. Nice clean office, fair pricing and good staff. Thank you!"
"5","I'm not sure if this is the exact Ross location that we went to, but we had a great time shopping at Ross.  If you want to shop here, make sure you're in the mood to dig through lots of clothing!  That's what we did, and we came out with some great bargains.  I got an adorable pair of shoes for $10, among other things.  It's not well-organized at all, so make sure you search for your size, and don't trust the little signs on the racks with the size numbers!"
"1","this ross is beyond rude! will not be shopping here again!"
"3","I normally go to the casino spas but after researching prices I came upon this place. Their prices were much better and I could get alot more for my money so I decided to try it. The staff was very nice. I got the 50/50 massage and facial. The facial was great...what a treat! The massage was also nice but don't waste your money on upgrades such as the scalp massage. They don't spend enough time on it to warrant the extra cost. If you are a local or you just want to be pampered without all the frills this is the place to go. However, I have decided I prefer the luxuriousness of the casino spas and will probably not go back."
"1","I've been going to Dr Auto since 2001 when Dave, and then Mike, ran an honest, reliable, and fair shop. I never felt like I was being taken advantage of, or upsold on services and/or products I did not need. I have taken all of my cars there for repairs for 10 years and have spent over $50k in that time. I don't believe in car payments, so I buy all my vehicles at auction, or fixer uppers. The guys at Dr Auto took care of all my needs and at no time did I ever feel taken advantage of.\nAll that has changed. After Mike & Dan, the Mgr. & the chief mechanic left the employ of Dr Auto about a month ago, I thought it strange that 2 key employees would leave this place at the same time. After a couple of experiences with the new Mgr, I feel that Dr Auto seems more concerned with increasing the bottom line than the \""Hometown Service With Integrity\"", claim. (their tag phrase). I don't like to make negative comments about anyone without careful consideration, especially when those people rely on repeat buisiness to thrive, but I will not give someone I don't trust any more of my money and I can not recommend them to anyone else. Be thorough, and ask questions if you have your car repaired there. Make sure that the recommended repairs are genuinely needed. Better yet, avoid this shop and find someone you can trust."
"1","It was a fast smog check..... But on the banner it says accepts all coupons. I brought a 9.99 coupon from purrfect auto. The guy there says he does not take the 9.99 coupons but will do it for 15!! Wtf! Last time I checked that was an any coupon!!!!!!"
"3","Kind of expensive and you have to work to get your crab out. The don't have the shell crackers, only a zip tool."
"1","I am not a huge fan, but I have always liked the Steam pots. I went on Sunday after about a 6-8 month hiatus and the quality has really declined. Dinner came with potatoes that were frozen in the middle, and corn on the cob that was 1) not hot and 2) probably old enough to vote. Service was OK. They gave us an $11 credit to address the two bad steam pots and replaced the potatoes and corn. Unfortunately, the replacement items were not seasoned, clearly not fresh, and the corn had some black kernels on it. The crab seemed to also not be as good as it used to be there. Not sure if they just had an off night, but I don't plan to go back."
"4","Never had a funner barber experience\nBlade Masters provided an original old school barber experience.  Really- jokes, laughs, great conversation, and quality hair cutting filled the spacious shop.  I felt like I stepped back in time when I saw the card table with dominoes at the comfy waiting area.  Folks were there to simply visit, which I loved-lets you know that this business treats every customer like a member of the \""circle\""\n\nPayed a visit to Vegas and needed to cut my locks off, found Blade Masters on a google search and dropped in.  Was attended to instantly, enjoyed the music and surrounding conversations so much I honestly didn't want to leave so soon.  Freaked out a little when baby boy whipped out the shaving blade-never had my edges cleaned up with shaving cream and a blade, @that point I decided I would be back to Blade Masters anytime I was in Las Vegas whether I need a hair cut or eyebrow arch...yes, they do eye brows!"
"2","Hopefully this place is better a night . . . but we were here during the late morning . . . and did we get looked at very strangely by the regulars all sitting at the bar . . . it was full by the way . . . and it was kinda creepy.  Thought if we found two seats at the bar . . . we would get people telling us to get out of Betsy's and Carl's seats or something.\n\nThe set-up looked pretty good for a local band to play and would probably be good for that . . . problem is . . . when I am in Las Vegas . . . I spend evening at the hotel and casino I am staying at.\n\nBottom line . . . I probably won't be back . . ."
"1","The only reason I called Molly Maids was because we got a coupon in the mail for them and my mother was coming to visit.  The first issue I had was that the number on the coupon didn't even work so I had to google them to get a working number.  I made an appointment for Saturday morning on a Tuesday.  Saturday rolls around, no call, no maids.  I call and get ahold of a \""Kate\"".  She proceeds to tell me that my appointment was lost or never properly recorded in their system.  When I asked her how they were going to make this right, she got attitude and raised her voice to me.  I asked for the manager and she tells me that she's the owner and she's the only one in the office on Saturdays......G-H-E-T-T-O  Don't waste your time with this terribly run \""organization\"".  (if you can even call it that).  My friend from back home told me that the main company is going out of business all over the country.  Now, I can see why."
"3","Applebee's is just one of those boring chain restaurants.  I do really love some chains, but alas, Applebee's is not one of them.   Everything is just ok.  Nothing ever blows my socks off or makes me crave to come here, but it isn't bad either, just blah.\n\nI found myself here yesterday because I was outvoted by the group I was with.  Oh well, it happens.  We went for lunch and it was an ok experience.  I had the Bourbon Black and Bleu Burger.  It was surprising yummy.  It had a lot of kick and I had a small party in my mouth.  It was better than I was expected, which was a nice surprise.  The other people in the party both got the 3 cheese penne and chicken dish.  I didn't sample it, but they both enjoyed it.  My picky eater, my 18 month old did surprise me by eating half of her grilled cheese.  She never eats anything, so that made me happy.  I tried a bite and it was quite good with the bread being a sweet, eggy bread, like brioche.  \n\nThe service was really good and we always had what we wanted without having to ask for it, which made for a pleasant meal.\n\nSo over all, the food was good, the service was great, but I am still bored with the overall place.  Give me Chili's anyday, but this Applebee's did a good job today.  Way to go Applebee's for slowing changing my opinion about you."
"4","Spinach artichoke dip is the bomb, used to be bigger but hey whatever. Drinks are strong, always a good thing. The waiter, Matt, is the bomb. He helped us make decisions and have good time before going out for the night. \n\nMy friend likes the menu since it has weight watchers options, I like it for the two for $20."
"3","TLDR: roller skating carhops; drive-thru open late; iffy service; happy hour available\n\nSonic Drive-Ins pride themselves on providing an enriching experience with every visit. I think they miss the bar at this location. \n\nThe food and drinks are standard and came out as expected. I always try to make an effort to attend during happy hour and get a Route 44 strawberry limeade or lemon berry slush paired with a corn dog as a midday pick-me-up. \n\nThe service was...interesting. I was greeted by an individual with cornrows who appeared to be bothered by the day. Maybe it's the heat, or the other customers, but she needed to wash her face because she got that dirty look on there and it definitely was not intended for me. Additionally, I'm gonna need these carhops to calm down. I almost hit one with my car as they zoomed by in the crosswalk. I hope they don't get hit. \n\nAll-in-all an okay experience. I rate it between 3/3.5 stars. I would return if in the area."
"4","I really like this beauty supply store, it's just so far from where I live.  So when I do get to that side of town, I  usually stop in because I know they have something I need or haven't seen, or need to get."
"2","I used to love this place three years ago.  Now, everything has gone downhill.  The service is lacking.  Our server didn't offer drinks until we were ready to order our food, and twice we were confused with two different tables, even bringing us another table's check!  My boyfriend was starving so he ordered what he THOUGHT was a steak, only to be presented with four chunks of beef on two sticks, and some grilled vegetables.  The chicken fettucini had maybe three small pieces of chicken in it, which was disappointing.  After we were done eating, the server tells us, \""We cut the portions AND the prices, so you get what you pay for.\""  HUH????  To top it off, after the bill came, another server took it and said, \""I'll hand it to him for you,\"" as if our own server was too busy to pick it up himself.  I used to work at a restaurant and never once did we ever pick up another server's bill \""for them.\""  My boyfriend offered my same sentiments when we left:  \""We're never going back there again.\"""
"2","My husband and I went to this particular location after church. We normally go to the W. Sahara location but we were on this side of town. We were immediately seated and was told that our waitress named Tiffany will be right over. Ten minutes later a lady came over and said that Tiffany was a little busy but can she start us out with drinks? I couldn't quite understand why she would be, do the fact that there was less than ten people in the building but OK.. Since we've been here a few times ,we already were familiar with the menu and ordered right away. It took them 20 minutes just to comeback with our salad.. And you guest it still no Tiffany. Our dinner was finally served 30 minutes later and It wasn't as good like the location on W Sahara. We normally stick around for dessert but we opted out. Tiffany never arrived. I hope shes OK"
"3","Dingy and smokey, but a decent neighborhood watering hole. Typical Vegas style bar that's been around for decades.\n\nGood pool tables and they host a few leagues there. Bartenders and bar staff are all cool and pour with a heavy hand. My friends's Makers and coke was 98% Makers with a splash of Coke for color!\n\nA lot of regulars and friendly boisterous bunch at that. I've never eaten here but at least they have a separate dining area for the non smokers, like me, because this place is nicotine heaven."
"3","Just your average Wal-Mart what else can I say? Service prices all the same. Nothing different here than any other Wal-Mart."
"1","HORRIBLE! We waited 2 hours! I made an appointment and they didn't take us in right away, the nails the lady did weren't pretty, she still wanted to charge so much money We will never return! Horrible service, not worth the money you pay. please stay away I wish I could give this NO stars -.-"
"1","Worst Eyebrow Waxing!\nI need my eyebrows done BAD! I onky went in because my husband was at a store next door. \nThe lady told me to go to the back and that shed be there in a sec.. as soon as she came in she just started putting wax on my eyebrows! Didnt say A WORD! So I stopped her and explained how I wanted them. She got all pissy and started loudly chompin on her gum then she started plucking my eyebrows so rough and fast and clipped some skin! NEVER COMING BACK! Picture shown is AFTER my eyebrows were \""done\"". I ended up going to sallys a few stores down and bought tweezers and cleaned them up myself. It looked like she didnt do anything!"
"2","Once again, Panda has given me poor, slow service and a streaming serving of meh. Why do I keep torturing myself? \n\nThree ppl in line, including me. Mr. Whispersalot keeps asking me questions that I can't hear over the music, workers, banging pots, and someone's screaming child. His co worker leans in and yells at me what he was asking, with lots of gesticulation, like I'm an imbecile. It's not that I couldn't understand him - I just couldn't HEAR him. Finally, I get across that I want the broccoli beef to go. He spoons it into the bowl and then asks me if it is for here or to go. Now who doesn't understand? I say to go again, he slaps a lid on it, then tells me to go to the checkout. \n\nThe two people in front of me are browsers, \""do you have this or that, can I have a sample of that, how much are your egg rolls,\"" etc. I bypass them and meet him at the checkout.\n\n...and he walks right past me into the back! I'm standing there like a doofus while the browsers continue their shopping for another 5 minutes or so. Meanwhile, little miss Can't Make Eye Contact completely ignores me. \n\nI stand there. She answers their questions. She gives samples. She sells them drinks. Mikey Can't Decide goes over his egg roll options again. She checks them out. My guy never returns. Finally, without looking at me, she asks, \""Is that for here or to go?\""\n\nArrrgh!\n\nThe food isn't good enough for this aggravation. Heck, it's not good, period."
"3","Food Availability: For some reason we arrive between 5pm-7pm, their popular Honey Walnut or regular fried rice always seems to be out. I guess we just arrive after busy hours or early diners? I'm not sure but some food choices are less then a scoop empty (majority are full depending on demand) and some ppl must wait until a fresh batch is made depending upon demand. \n\nBeen here a couple times since its on the way home from work. I go here with a coworker during dinner time between 5pm - 7pm depending what time we arrive. \nPretty much slow with a few guests, and it's a quiet and settling atmosphere. We always seem to be served by the same person, a guy named Luis. He was very courteous and responsive to our food decisions.\n\nOverall, good place for a quick dinner. A star for convenience and 2 stars for Luis, his customer service skills is what keeps this place from having a lackluster dining experience."
"2","I ordered from the website for this location.  Luckily enough it also gives you a tracker to tell you where your pizza is in the process.  Unfortunately for them it showed me that the pizza was out of the oven and sitting in the store for about 30 minutes before it even left with the delivery driver.  I don't mind waiting for pizza, but I do not expect it to be 40 minutes old by the time it gets to me.  On top of that I complained and was told that they would give 2 LG free on my next order and the credit was on my account (ph#) wouldn't you know.... I call and nothing was there no credit, no nothing.  Lucky for me that there lots of other choices for good pizza in the area."
"2","I've ordered delivery twice for papa John's.  both times my pizza was delivered at room temperature. The second pizza was even free courtesy of the manager because of it. and both times I was told that it would take 45-60mns and took close to 2hrs. I was accommodated for my dissatisfaction, so the reason for me writing this is not to come down on the staff, but there needs to be a change. Maybe they need to hire more people or whatever unless they want to keep giving away free pizzas."
"1","They now charge items by the pound... practically a rummage sale.\n\nyes... fill your cart up with whatever.. you want & they put it on the scale for .99cents a pound...items such as books furniture & electronics are at a flat rate...\nmy mom ALWAYS goes here & comes back with at least 5 full bags...\nThey put everything in bins you have to rummage thru everything..\nBooks are .25cents which is why I will go back."
"1","We went to live to eat taco and I got the cashier service bues these ali does not want to take water from natural and has a bad attitude bad"
"1","They charged $110 to tell me that my gas cap wasn't screwed on tightly. After my furious husband told them that we would obviously not be back, the manager told us that was fine, and proceeded to flip my husband off as we drove out. Nice customer service. \n\nJust for the record, we went there about a year prior to this service call for new brakes and spent about $400. The team back then was completely different and had great customer service which is why we went back in the first place. \n\nDon't go there."
"1","Waited almost 3 hours for them to complete my oil change because of a plug I needed. The auto parts store kept bringing over the wrong part. They even had to send Midas people there. Customer service and communication was horrible. They kept making excuses for themselves and weren't even accommodating. They kept saying that they are trying to help by offering me the plug versus the oil pan that would be more money. I wish they would have been upfront with me and told me how long the job would take. I will NEVER come back to Midas again."
"1","Yeah, one star for stealing my honey's credit card.  Thank goodness American Express is more loyal to its customers than you people are.  Using his credit card up & down Nellis blvd is retarded. \nEat a dick & gain some integrity."
"3","Got home after picking up my order and realized they forgot my breadsticks. I even ordered extra. I called to get a refund on the extra ones and was told I would need to speak to a manager, 10 minutes holding and no one. I hung up. Poor customer service. Food was good though."
"1","Never actually ate in there but we ordered some dishes once and they were disappointing. We ordered some shrimp chow mein and some beef dish and both dishes were filled with filler. The shrimp dish had those little shrimp that you usually find in fried rice and the rest of the dish was all basically frozen vegetables. Everything seemed like it came out of the cheapest bulk bag of product they could find at Costco. I don't know about the buffet but nothing I ate made me want to go back. The place has been open for at least 7-8 years by now so it must be doing something right. Maybe the buffet is rather cheap and has a good selection but the food I got from them was nothing I would want more of. The Chinese food in the Boulder and Sam's Town buffets down the street are much better than what I had here and I'm pretty sure there's better Chinese food in the surrounding area. There always seems to be families going here or parties of 5 or more so it probably priced cheap enough for a family to come in and look the other way when it comes to taste."
"1","i thought pharmacists were supposed to help people. if i could give less then 1 star i would. the woman here treats every patient like a drug addict. my sister had just got out of the hospital after having her gall bladder removed and this woman wouldnt fill her prescription. i would go anywhere but here. and i wish i could do more than just leave this review."
"1","Doesn't even deserve 1 star. Dirty store, the most Ghetto, worst customer service including management, aisles always blocked at night so customers can't walk through loud vulgar employees yelling through the store. More people begging in parking lot than customers. Products never labeled correctly. Never enough cashiers or employees at customer service desk."
"4","We came here after a stress-filled morning and were pleasantly surprised. This Denny's is nothing like the one we'd been to previously. The cook actually did a great job, the service was spot-on and the waitress was awesome."
"3","Ok food. Ok service. Left smelling horrible of cigarette smoke."
"2","I would give the food 4 stars... Their staff would get 0 stars... So, I feel 2 stars is fair. I love their food and was exited to learn there was one right down the street from Nellis AFB! But, I will not be going back to this location! My order was rang out wrong. I was given an attitude about them forgetting my drink. Then, my sandwich was wrong and I didn't ask them to remark it. I simple asked for the pickles they forgot. I was screamed at because my pickles would come out of the cashiers pay?! Other employees stepped in and apologized but I was already mad at that point. Went back to the table and told my husband we were leaving! The cashier sat right outside the door and took a smoke break. We had to basically climb over her to leave. Then she thought it would be a good idea to call me a b**** as we got into our truck! I'm sorry I asked for pickles I paid for & you forgot my drink... I would have happily paid for the drink but you were busy being rude because you rang everything out separately. Costing me more money... As far as your rude comments,  I'll be adding them to my military wife blog and telling everyone not to bother eating at this location. Sorry Arby's, I love your food but your lack of customer service is horrible!"
"2","The staff was nice but didn't listen when our order was taken and some of the order was messed up. Some of the customers were very loud and ghetto. The tables could be cleaned better! I didn't want to go into the bathroom."
"2","I've been to this restaurant a few times now the first time was a good experience fast sitting no wait for drinks and not a long wait for food. The second time not so good I went on 4th. of July and it wasn't busy at all maybe 5 or 6 tables with people and 4 waitresses. So services should of been fast so you would think. We order our sons food first being 4 he has a small attention span when it comes to restaurants and places a like. After we order him eggs and toast we were told the waitress would come back in a few to get my wife and I's order. Well a few minutes turned in to 15 -20 minutes. After all that wait time a completely different waitresses took our order because the first one didn't seem to enthused to be a work. Granted it was the 4th of July but it was the afternoon. I order the chicken parm sub was way over salted just not good was ok though. If I was you I would skip this and head somewhere else. Granted the food is good but service not so good."
"5","Great breakfast joint that reminds me of waffle-house. Do not order anything that could be stored in the fridge as it tastes like it have ( huevos ranchos ). Massive omlettes that are worth the price."
"3","Service is great.  Price is nice and food is good.  The real gem here are the appetizers.  The crispest fried chicken wings, \nshrimp and vegetables you will find anywhere at any cost.  Have not ate buffet...not buffet guy."
"4","I must say since Sears took over they did a good job with Kmart. The prices aren't bad. From TV's to housewares. They seem to carry higher end products than Walmart. The furniture is of higher quality too. Picked up a nice real wood kitchen table. Its like a mini Sears. It was 8pm and only 3 cashiers were working. They still have layaway and implemented a rewards card program. If more people shop here it will knock Walmart off its high horse. I will be back."
"2","I feel like Rachel Ray's evil twin when I talk about this place.  Yuck-O!\n\nThis is located by a bunch of office buildings in the industrial part of the city, so I know who they're catering to.  It's quick, it's easy, and I have a feeling that a lot of burly guys workin' fork lifts all day don't have the most delicate of palates.\n\nHowever, I worked by here for a while and while I did sometimes I got stuck at my desk through lunch hour.  Munch a Sub (we ended up calling it Punch a Pud) was my only hope. \n\nThe bread was always ALWAYS soggy.  Their meat tasted like processed food stuffs instead of actual meat.  Veggies were limp, sauces were wrong, things were forgotten.  Munch A Sub should only be utilized in dire episodes of near starvation."
"5","Friendly and excellent service, large polish selection! \n\nI called and made an appointment for the same day. I got their basic pedicure service, which was only $20 but they have $30 and $40 packages as well. \n\nWhat made a good impression on me is that they don't have the overpowering chemical smell as most nail places. Maybe it's because they are a full-service salon (mani/pedi, massage, hair salon, make-up, eyelash extensions)"
"2","Probably one of the worst resorts I have been to. The place looks and feels like a 5 star resort, but once you settle you'll notice that your eyes will deceive you. \n\nWe checked in with some amazing staff (which is why I didn't give this place a 1 star) and we walked out the door and were caught up by the timeshare ladies. We ended up signing up and claimed our $100 gift card. We then went to the room. Here's a quick summary of the resort.\n\nPRO's:\n\n -Decent looking rooms\n-Decent Customer Service\n\n-CON's:  \n\n-NO Wifi? Are you kidding me? I can stay are a hole in the wall in Tijuana and still get free internet. This is what started me off on the wrong foot. \n\n-Thin walls/Ceilings: I felt as if we were in a 1980's movie where the old lady bangs the ceiling with a broom stick because the people upstairs are noisy. We actually had to do that! This place was built with the thinnest walls/ceilings I have EVER seen in my LIFE! We heard the people upstairs walking from 3am-6am then house keeping from 8am-12pm. This was ridiculous. Kept a lot of us up at night. \n\n-The rooms had a smell (we had no idea what kind of smell it was)\n\n-Room remote controlls were dirty and didn't work. (I hope housekeeping actually cleans these things). \n\n-Showers didn't drain properly\n\nThe list could go on and on. The main reason we stayed at this resort was due to the Yelp reviews and the fact that this place had balconies (we have smokers in the family). I would rather stay at an older hotel that is a little closer to the strip as well.\n\nIf you are looking to stay here, I would suggest you choose else where."
"1","One of the worse carne asada burritos I ever had.    I will never go back.   And the salsa?   You've got to be kidding me.    Did you get it from a can?"
"4","What is there really to say about Roberto's that's new? Most people know about the chain by now. But I will note two things:\n\n1) Many of the stores have slight variations on their specials menu so it's always worth checking out.\n\n2) Just from personal experience, while their menu is standardized, I tend to stick to older locations. Maybe it's all in my head, but the food just seems cheesier and more delicious at the older locations in town versus the super-sleep looking newer ones. Then again, maybe I am a sucker for spots that let their food do the talking versus using decor to convince you that things are better than they are in reality."
"4","One of the top tier Hampton's we have stayed at, and we have been to a lot of them across the USA.  Quiet, comfortable, and great breakfast with ample eating area.  Within easy walk of The Strip.  The only Hampton with a full bar and slots for those who want to leave a little money in Vegas.  Highly recommend."
"3","Yelp has this place listed twice. The one on Industrial Rd is the same as this place. A bit odd.\n\nOverall, this is nicer than your typical Hampton Inn. It's all in a South Pacific theme and the lobby area has a staffed bar, which I've never seen in a Hampton property. Staff was quite genuinely friendly. The place seems clean and rooms are outfitted very nicely. \n\nI have one major gripe, though, and I would never stay here on business again because of it. There's no WiFi in the guest rooms. They have wired connections available, but I hate being tied to the desk. There's WiFi in the lobby area (very sluggish, though) but that's it. \n\nThe value was great and proximity to The Strip was fantastic."
"2","i used this business 2 years ago and signed up for a year of service for $25.00\nper month.  i had my thermostat replaced and the service person said i needed\n2 compactors for my furnace, costing around $250.  he tried to \""sell\"" me a\nnew heater/a/c unit, which i declined.\n\nanother new service person came to check out my \""free\"" a/c unit last spring,\nbut it cost $159.00.  he said he would put himself down, on paper, to schedule\nmy next service.  i did NOT like that! \n\nsince he was buying a new home, he also tried to \""sell\"" me a new heater/a/c unit;\nand even took pictures of my outside units on video.  he said the wires might\nget hot and things looked rusty.  he kept bugging me about making coffee, and\nasked too many questions of my home.  i had had it with them, and i called\nthem to stop mailing and phoning me.\n\nwould not recommend this kind of service to anyone.\n\nbarb b\n9/6/2013"
"4","Again, a place that doesnt look like much from the outside but I assure you, this place is the bees knees!!  Their breakfast burritos are the best I have ever had!  I am a huge fan and go here a couple times a month.  Great rolled tacos and enchiladas as well.  Their green salsa is to die for.  Go here and get a breakfast burrito, you wont be disappointed!!"
"2","mm.. it's okay here!? \njust moving from one state to another and getting situated at home calls for a lot of take-out, so i figured... now's the time to really see what's up with these places that are generally new to the area too... (sort of.)\n\nso, i say....\ntheir are better places for chinese take-out."
"2","Oh Good God. NO!\n\nI stopped by here the other day for lunch because I had to do my weekly run for lunch for our pricing meeting. I wasn't in the mood for what I was getting for everyone else so I thought Chinese, as long as they have a lunch special - why not?\n\nSo tried I did. And never again.\n\nYou walk in and they are helpful and friendly. The place is big and clean.\n\nOf course it's your typical standard \""Chinese fare\"". Their menu was big and many, many choices. \n\nI had to spend at least ten dollars so I could use my debit card so I ordered the pot stickers (which cost the same as my lunch special, go figure.) and chicken in garlic sauce with fried rice. \n\nOkay, truth be told I am never satisfied with fried rice from a Chinese place because I know how to make good fried rice but most fried rice from any Chinese spot is always bland and under seasoned so I don't have much gripes when it comes to bad fried rice. I can pile on sriracha and soy sauce and make it work somehow. \n\nHowever, my chicken dish was NASTY. The chicken tasted like pieces of rubber chicken that was slightly chewy but not chewy. I don't know, I can't explain. It was just odd. The flavor of the sauce was off, just not good. The broccoli in the dish was not fresh, you could see the yellowness in it. Bad idea to cook and serve this to customers. Yeah, I just didn't like it.\n\nPot stickers is the saving grace of this place. Only reason it gets two stars because I could and did eat them. \n\nGood thing I only paid $6.00 for my lunch special. But let's just say I paid $6.00 for a very upset stomach for the rest of the day. \n\nPass, do not stop at Go. If you do, you deserve to go directly to jail."
"1","These guys are crooks. They could not have been less organized when bringing our goods into the convention hall. It was as if they let 50 guys out of prison and give them forklifts. No joke. The guys who were supposed to unload our truck got into a violent argument over their favorite classic rock bands, so we ended up unloading the truck. \n\nWeeks later I find out that it cost me $1.00 per pound to move my exhibit the 200 ft from the loading dock to my space. I can ship goods from Boston to California for $0.30 per pound. \n\nThis rate is a total joke. The terrible service is just insult to injury. Companies like this just can't last. I won't be going back to Expo East and that's about $25k in lost revenue. That's someones job. There is recourse for being a crook and treating people like garbage."
"1","Agree 100% with every review here.  This is exactly why so many Americans despise union labor! \n\nEXTORTION is defined as \""the crime of obtaining money or some other thing of value by the abuse of one's office or authority\"".  This couldn't be a more fitting term for this company.  You are absolutely forced to use their useless services that barely anyone needs, and be charged completely egregious amounts! \n\nMy colleagues and I attended an event where packing up our materials took all of about 6 minutes, yet they still charged us for their \""union labor\"" of about $400.  Ok so lets break this down - even if they did do the work themselves, is packing 2 boxes in 6 minutes really worth that much???  How can anyone logically justify such an insane amount? \n\nThey are completely disorganized, rude and absolutely greedy - couple that with flat out lazieness and you get the equation for everything that is wrong in America! \n\nRide the wave while you can GES...get completely overpaid and take multiple 1 hour breaks throughout a single day, all without doing any real work -  the ways of your world are dying out as the government slowly dismantles your corrupt, useless and archaic system...then you'll actually have to work in a world filled with competition where your pay is actually based on PERFORMANCE (gasp!)."
"3","If you work in the restaurant or baking business, chances are you have heard of or have purchased items from Chef Rubber. They carry a wide selection of items (i.e., baking equipments, cooking tools, molecular gastronomy ingredients, rare or hard to find cookbooks).\n\nMost of the people do business with Chef Rubber through online purchases, but they do have a physical location in Las Vegas (even if it is located in a non-descript commercial building with a really small Chef Rubber logo.  Taking a cab here is possible, but not recommended, as trying to get a cab on the way back is difficult without calling for one from dispatch.\n\nThey also offer classes, like chocolate and pulled sugar, taught by some very talented pastry chefs.  I know Chef Jin Caldwell (world class chocolatier and Head Chocolatier at Ethel M's) have taught the chocolate classes here (not sure if she still has the time to teach here).  But these are geared towards industry professionals that want to improve their skills.\n\nI can literally spend an entire afternoon just looking at all the cool stuff on their shelves.  But prices for items is definitely not cheap. But what you get in return for their healthy markups is the wide selections under one roof.\n\n\nLocation:  3/5 Worth the drive if you live in Las Vegas.  Otherwise just buy it online and have it shipped.\nPrice: 2/5  Pricey.\nSelection: 4.5/5  They have a lot of stuff!"
"5","Awesome place, they have everything, i couldn't believe my eyes. The staff there is amazing!!!"
"2","It's 7:30 am. Time for breakfast. Let's see... Hmmm... no eggs of any kind. Do I want a plate of sausage gravy or some turkey sausage? Maybe a banana that was ripe about 2 weeks ago. Maybe I can have both the gravy AND the turkey sausage...\n\nAfter 10 minutes of this and watching Magdelina make sure that there were PLENTY of froot loops to go along with the over ripe bananas, the sausage gravy, and the turkey sausage,, I grabbed a cup of coffee and went on my way... Hungry.\n\nThere are literally HUNDREDS of hotels in Las Vegas. Stay elsewhere."
"1","The worst of the worst, did not keep their booking prepaid for a stretch limo.\n\nTerrible customer service by management as they never call you back when a problem arises.\n\nRuined our wedding."
"1","Garbage company.  Took a town car from the airport to our hotel, set up the return trip with the driver.  His name was Ashley Silver, and he never reserved the return trip.  Called the company to confirm last night and they knew nothing about us.  So we set up a car for this morning at 6am, and when it was almost too late to get another service we get an email saying there was no car available.  \n\nDO NOT use this lousy company or you will likely end up stuck somewhere."
"2","Was just dropped off at Bellagio.  Realized left phone In car.  Called the company and driver says it's not in there.  Called within 5 minutes of being dropped off. Will update this post if it is found otherwise I am skeptical that it still isn't in the car\n  Sentimental pics on phone too"
"5","Jonathon Bridges, you are an amazing taxi driver. Thank you so much for your service on 11/22/14. He was attentive, giving us useful information around the strip. He even asked us before we hopped out of the taxi if there was anything else he could help us with. He was sooo nice! I can't thank him enough! If you are calling for a cab for this company, ask for Jonathon Bridges. Trust me.. we all know how typical cab drivers are in Vegas especially.. he is different! TRUST ME!"
"1","Negative star! This place is the last place you want to go. I went there to get my lab results, they had me wait for 2 hrs just to tell me my labs aren't ready and i had to come back!"
"1","The worst ran business in Las Vegas. I needed a scratch on a bumper to be buffed and painted. The man said 1 day....well four days later they are still not done. Here's the best part. They claim to have a \""loaner\"" car. The car wouldn't even kick into gear and is a danger to drive, not only to the driver but the general public. I arrive on the 4th day to pick up the car they said it's still not done and to come back in 30-45 minutes. No call ahead to let me know that it would be a longer wait. Oh yea they only take cash and don't tell you until your car is already in their position. They will charge you just as much as a legit body ran properly so don't waist your time."
"5","OUTSTANDING COMMUNICATION, SERVICE AND QUALITY REPAIR!\nI couldn't be happier!\nFREE loan car! No, or partial deductible!\nOnly 8 business days to make my 2006 Solara look like new! I HIGHLY recommend them!\nTell 'em I sent you!!!\n- Gary"
"3","Near Chef Rubber they have the large-scale equipment and smaller wares you would need in order to open a food business. They have a lot of dishes, tools, pans for a cheaper price if its what you need."
"4","Swung by one morning on my way to work. Only had about 15 minutes to browse around. Definitely not enough time to see fully what this place had. From what I could see, they had mostly small wares, although they do have some big equipment as well. The prices were high on some things, low on others. They have rows and rows of small items, that I could not explore this trip, so next time I'll make sure I go when I'm not rushed."
"1","HATE  One of my shirts had a stain when I got it back that was NOT there when I dropped it off. Inattentive employees (I literally rang the bell 10 times with no response after waiting for a clerk for 15 minutes).\n\nDISLIKE  They laundered my shirts after I told them I wanted them dry cleaned (partially my fault cause I didn't make sure the ESL clerk understood me).\n\nLIKE  Open late.\n\nLOVE  Nothing."
"2","I usually like La Quinta but this one was not a great choice.  I don't think there are many people here.  There are only about 5 cars in the parking lot.  But the room is ok.  Not lovely like other La Quintas. I think La Quinta should reconsider this hotel.  It doesn't represent their brand At All.\nIn specific, the TV isn't good.  A light bulb was burn't out.  The Coffee at breakfast was about 1/2 strength (that's just weird). and the closet hasn't been vacuumed in a long time.\nSIGH.\n\nSo much for making reservations on line."
"1","Let me start by saying that I've been to this ER 10 times, and have been admitted for a 3-5 day stay 8 times over the last 3 years. \nI have a chronic kidney condition that acts up every couple months and usually leaves me laid up for a week in excruciating pain.\n\nAfter my last 2 experiences, I will never come back to this ER EVER again, if I can help it.\n\nER review: \nWhen I first came here after my surgeries, everyone was kind, attentive, and VERY good...getting IVs was fairly painless (for getting an IV).\n\nThe second to last time I was in, I gave them my back story (chronic kidney pain, CANNOT do a CT, because I had a surgical clip left inside of me that looks like a kidney stone when a CT is done.  They have to do a renal scan).\n\nTwo hours of pain later, the radiology guy comes back to give me a CT.  \nOk fine...but can I get SOMETHING for the pain?  \""We have to give you a non-narcotic.\""  Ok fine, I know my history makes me look like a drug seeker (which I'm not).  \""Non-Narcotics trash my kidneys and make me ill.  Call my surgeon, Dr. _____.  I always get dilauded when I'm in here. 2 mg, with Zofran for the nausea.\""   \n\n\""Well we can give you morphine\""\n\n\""Can someone please look at my records?  I'm allergic.  Morphine makes me itch.  How about an asprin?  Something?  SOMETHING to take the edge off until you talk to a Doctor about getting me pain killers.\""\n\nSo they finally get me something...and I get it, you have to weed out the seekers.  I've heard them before.  But after waiting two hours, not complaining at all, not ASKING for any painkillers till that point...plus they can look up my records.\n\nNevermind the fact that it took 3 people to start my IV.  *sigh*\n\nAnyway, after all this, they give me a CT...and surprise!  \""You have a stone.\""\nme: \""No I don't, I have a surgical clip that was left inside me.  I told them this at admitting.  You have to do an ultrasound or a renal scan.\""\n\nSo they finally do and guess what...ITS A CLIP, NOT A STONE!!  *sigh*\nIdiots.  Not all of us are clueless here.\n\nSo they admit me.  Detailed hospital review to follow.  \nThe LAST time I went to the ER, I was having chest pains. \n\nThey took me right back for an EKG, which apparently was normal?  Because I sat in an empty waiting room for two hours before they brought me back for further examination.\n\nThey said \""Its not your heart.  Here, we're going to give you morphine and a nitro drip.\""\n\nme:  \""um.  What?  Why am I getting morphine?  I'm allergic.\""\n\n\""Well what do you usually get?\""\n\nMe: \""Dilauded...but I don't...\""\n\nThem (cutting me off) \""Well we don't give that for heart issues.\""\n\nMe: \""Number 1, you JUST said it wasn't my heart.  Number two...I don't WANT a pain killer, I want to know what is wrong with me.  Number three, if it isn't my heart, WHY are you giving me a nitro drip?  No.  Sorry.  I'm going home.\""  \n\nSigned out AMA.  Not that I actually GOT any medical advice, but I figured if I was going to die, I wanted to do so in my own bed.   (turns out I was just REALLY stressed.)\n\nSo...onto the Hospital stays.\n\nAgain, when I first was admitted, everyone was awesome.  \n\nThe last 2 times I was admitted was AWFUL.\n\nI had Nurses who gave me attitude, doctors prescribing blood thinner shots, and ANTIDEPRESSANTS (for a kidney issue.  Yeah...what sense does that make?)\n\nSo...Whenever I'm admitted to the hospital, I'm on dilauded for 3-4 days.  The first 2 days, I ALWAYS get sick.  ALWAYS.  Even with Zofran for nausea.  I always throw up at least once.  \n\nThe second to last time I was in, it was my first night.  I was in pain, miserable, and just got hit with a wave of nausea.  I tried to get out of bed to grab a bucket, trash can, get to the bathroom, anything, but I didn't make it, and I vomited on the floor next to my bed. So now, I'm in pain, miserable, nauseated, and embarrassed.  And the nurse gave me attitude about it.  Yes.  I vomited on the floor JUST to piss you off.\n\nThe last time I was in, I had a similar experience, I was being wheeled up to my room, and was vomiting in a bucket (sometimes you just can't help it) and the nursing staff looked absolutely disgusted.\nThis is your JOB.  To take care of people who are ill...if you have to look disgusted about a little vomit, at least walk away first.  Don't make us feel worse.\n\nI will NEVER come back here again, unless I am unconscious and have no choice."
"5","My elderly parents live in Las Vegas.  They are 84 years old.  Recently, due to a serious illness my father was admitted and treated at Spring Valley Hospital for pneumonia.  From the moment he was admitted to the ER, then subsequently transferred to the hospitals Critical Care Unit on the 2nd floor he received nothing but the best treatment, care and consideration. The doctors and nurses were exceptional.  We were even offered a bed to sleep in so that my sybillings and I could stay the night with him. \nHe was admitted 4 more times over the last few months.  This was due to failing health. \nNot due to negligence or early discharge or follow up care.  My mother is now in the rehab unit because she had to have a knee replacement.  Yet again we had the pleasure of the staff and same treatment my father received.  I would hightly recommend Spring Valley Hospital.  Also while talking with other professionals about Spring Valley Hospital all noted that the staff is very happy there and many have often spent  many years employed by the hospital. It is also a very clean hospital."
"2","The only good tasting food here is the pulled pork sandwich, everything else is poor. I am from the east coast where we have BBQ cook offs and such, so I know good BBQ. This place does a poor job in my opinion. Friendly waitresses/servers and good sweet tea but that's about it."
"1","I took the time to drive to what I was told was a great BBQ place, after one experience here I won't be back . I had to gnaw through a rack of baby back ribs the consistency of jerky , with hardly any sauce to speak of, and when I asked for extra sauce what they game did not taste as good as the BBQ sauce I dip my nuggets in at \""insert fast food chain here\"". Even the rolls were stale,the highlight of my meal was the sweet potato which a 3 year old could master the cooking off..."
"4","My favorite place to eat in Las Vegas. Solid BBQ.\n\nTry the Hot Links."
"1","Absolutely the worst meal ever. Catfish was old fishy and the wait staff\"" we've had a lot of complaints. It must really be bad\"" wth . .burnt ends were crap too. Not fresh at all."
"2","Well the food was OK at best.  Middle of the road BBQ is giving it to much credit.  I'm not a famous Dave fan but its better. Man I miss Missouri."
"1","I'm a snob when it comes to restaurant service.  I expect good service and tip accordingly.  The service did not disappoint.  The food, however, needs some major revamping.  I had a half a rack of their supposedly award winning baby back ribs.  The meat was dry and had absolutely no flavor.  The two sides I ordered were the fried okra and the mac and cheese.  The mac and cheese looked and tasted like it came out of a Kraft Mac and Cheese box.  Also had the three item sampler:  onion straws, fried pickles, and burnt ends.  I kid you not, there was literally a puddle of oil under the wax paper in the basket that held the appetizers.  TGIF's baby back ribs are much more flavorful and their meat is much more savory.  Will definitely not be returning to this place.  Plus one star for the service experienced."
"3","I attended Mass while in Vegas on business.  The deacon asks visitors to stand before Mass and introduces / welcomes you to the church community.  I thought this was very thoughtful.  There are no kneelers so you stand when you would normally kneel.  The altar is in the middle of the room with everyone facing in which was nice.  There was no crucifix so I know that would have bothered my wife had she been with me but all in all I really enjoyed Mass.  Felt very inviting and comfortable."
"3","If you're a dude, expect an awesome service. Female? you're better off asking your guy friends to order for you. Haha.\n\nWent here one time with a friend. She got \""discriminated\"" or that's what she thought. Well, she was sitting at the end of the bar where the bartenders couldn't see her!\n\nDrinks are okay priced at $6.50. Went here on a Saturday night. Thank god, no cover! They were pretty much playing traditional country and pop country.\n\nWould come back here with a group of guy friends rather than women."
"5","I have tried several places in town until I finally found this place, and I don't think I would be going elsewhere. I have extremely small nails and it must be a major pain in the butt to do them all, but those girls do it just fine without complaining. It's past their business hours (Sunday 6:05pm) but my technician is still working hard to perfect my toes. I feel blessed to have found this place, and I recommend this place to anyone I know. 37 bucks to get an hour long pedicure accompanied with twenty min massage... and this one lasts for good four weeks. Thank you TiNA !"
"4","We took the south rim Grand Canyon tour. The bus is smaller and more intimate than most other tour companies, the driver and guide was fantastic and knowledgeable.\n\nIt started with pick-up at our hotel, we were provided a light breakfast when we boarded which included a juice and pastry. We picked up one other passenger and were off. Because there was only 3 people on the tour she let us stop at the welcome to las vegas sign to take pictures. \n\nThe drive was long, but the scenery made it go by quickly. When we got to the canyon she parked the jeep and we grabbed our lunches at the first point. Lunches provided were a sub style sandwich, chips, cookies, soft drink, cheese and crackers and carrot sticks, it was huge none of us actually finished it then so we all had snacks on the drive back. They also provide bottled water all day. \n\nAfter lunch we got to enjoy a beautiful hike along the south rim to various other look out points, then back to the bus for a trek to Bright Angel lodge, where we got to explore the many shops and other lookout points. We hiked a bit into the canyon at bright angel. \n\nOverall the whole trip was great, the guide was great, and I would definitely use pink jeep for future tours."

"5","One day Brett came in to my store ( Home Depot )  with his family to rent a tool. I recognized him since I watch the show. I happened to help him since he was next in line.  He was really a nice guy and very friendly. When I helped him to his car since the tool he rented was very heavy to lift. We chatted for a bit. Before going, he said for me to come in to the shop for a tour of the shop. Of course I accepted. Days later I went to the shop. Someone at the front desked walked me to his office. He did recognize me and kept his word about the tour. I met some of the workers. Everyone was very friendly. I got showed some exotic fish, the back area where they make the tanks. Met a few of their birds lol. It was a good experience. Thank you to ATM"
"1","The front office supervisor is incredibly rude. Sad that my mom went to this office for years and this is how I am treated. Not only did my mom never get an accurate diagnosis when the entire world knew she had dementia, but now I am dealing with someone raising my own blood pressure. Ridiculous."
"5","We needed a plumber to replace our pressure reducing valve\nA friend told me about Colburn Enterprise - best thing that could happen to us\nJohn came out check the valve - replaced it - asked use if we had any question on anything\nGreat Guy - Great Service - Great price\nI will be recommending Colburn Enterprises to all my friends and neighbors who might need a plumber!\nThey are the best in my book by far!!"
"5","Got home found water softner leaking. Called a few places and looked online. Saw the yelp reviews and decided to give a try since there's only good things about this place. Also. They had the $40 voucher .. What a deal since majority of all the places I called had around that a high cost to come by and check it out. Although Jeremy was backed up in prior appts the secretary updated me on what time he was able to come! I reAlly thought that was awesome! Great customer service! Jeremy was very helpful and explained what happened to my water softner. Very polite and friendly. Definitely will keep their # in hand for future reference/recommendations! Good prices!"
"2","My youngest son's future Father-In-Law had Breakfast at this Original Pancake House location yesterday... the very first time I've been to an OPH, even when I was living here... I was just shaking with anticipation of a great Breakfast.\n\nOn the menu...\n\nIrish Corned Beef Hash (***) A Homemade Hash, with a blend of Kosher Corned Beef, Potatoes, Onions and Cream. This entree, under the category \""Specialties of the House\"" should have been rated under two-Stars, but because of it's heftiness the concoction provides a Value deserving of something a litte higher. All the \""Specialties\"" are Oven-Baked... I asked the waitress what is the difference between an Oven-Baked entree versus something you just grill in a Frying Pan... \n\nShe replied that this was actually her fist week... and that she'd get back to me...  \n\nOtherwise, this is a rather pedestrian and a very bland \""Specialty\"" entree... The concoction was pretty high... over three inches, but not because of it's fluffiness.... but rather because of all it's ingredients literally piled on top of each other\n\nI later found out, with the help of my son, that Oven Baking this entree supposedly provides a Fluffiness to the entree that Frying does not provide and supposedly the entree is NOT folded over as with traditional Omelets. But, he further added, that the Yolk of the Eggs are supposed to be separated from Whites and the ingredients are layered during the Oven Baking process.\n\nBTW, all the Specialty items will require a close to 20 minute wait for your Entree... because of the Oven Baking...\n\nSide Order of 3-Buttermilk Pancakes (* 1/2 Came with Meal) I always have to provide a rationale to my son about how I judge Pancakes, especially Flour based Pancakes.\n\n 1) Fluffiness - You have two extremes under this category - The \n  Heavy-Ass Pancake - where it is sooo heavy that you have to go right \n  after your meal. And then there's the light-as-a-feather Pancake that \n  will have you consuming close to a dozen without any ill effects. \n  Unfortunately, OPH's Pancakes are the HEAVY kind...\n\n 2) Absorption - Again, there are two extremes under this category... \n  Pancakes that seemingly act like a Sponge - no matter how much \n  Syrup you pour onto the Pancake... the Pancake still needs more \n  and more and more. And then there's the Pancakes the seeming are \n  resistant to Syrup (or any kind of liquid) - the Pancakes just will not \n  absorb Syrup, but you can sop up the Syrup with each fork-full.\n\nOPH's Pacakes are the worst of the two qualities I mentioned above... HEAVY - and I mean H-E-A-V-Y... and no matter how much Syrup you put on... the Pancakes WILL still need more!\n\nCoffee (***) The Best part of the meal, mainly because it was not objectionable. But the Coffee did not have any positive attributes either.\n\nAfter talking to my youngest son about my experience at Original Pancake House yesterday, he said that this specific location was supposedly the worst OPH location in Las Vegas. I guess fate drove me here. BTW, my son is a fanatic about OPH... in a good way..."
"1","We won't be going again.\n\nI was really craving the Dutch Baby - which is stellar, and I decided to treat my two boys to breakfast there yesterday morning.\n\nThe service was good.  We were seated right away, and our waitress was spot on, as far as service goes.\n\nMy oldest son requires gluten-free food.  Normally, for breakfast, this is never an issue.  Eggs, bacon and potatoes are easy, and he loves them.\n\nBoth of my sons ordered the bacon and eggs for breakfast, and both asked to substitute the 3 pancakes for the potatoes.  She said SURE!  Guess what?  Not only was the serving of potatoes huge (they could have easily split one - a really good waitress would have suggested this) - but it was a $3 UPCHARGE for each order of potatoes!  Because potatoes are SO MUCH MORE expensive than pancakes?  WHAT?  Ridiculous!  AND - we weren't told about the upcharge!  Since a stack of 6 pancakes is $6, and potatoes are $3, I assumed this would be a wash.  It was not.  Insane!  The eggs were fine - but all of the bacon was completely overdone - crispy and border-line burnt.\n\nMy Dutch Baby was stellar, I loved it.  It normally comes with strawberries, but they are out of season (and I understand this) and I was offered bacon.  Not only was the bacon overdone, I was charged $6 for it.  \n\nBreakfast for me, and for 2 little boys, totaled $49.98.  Besides my Dutch Baby, the food was mediocre, at best.  And the best?  We got home and my son had obviously been \""glutened\"".  He suffered an adverse reaction immediately.  \n\nNever again.  I'll figure out how to make Dutch Babies myself!"
"1","This place used to be good... About a year or more ago. It seems to me they have changed ownership or management or something. The food quality is bad now. They have a menu item that has a bunch of bacon. The bacon used to be crispy and thick not it couldn't be more thin and under cooked. They give you a huge plate with two items on it and it makes it look like they forgot part of your meal. I've tried everything here. Nothing is good. \n\nI had the sausage and hash browns. The hash was undercooked (despite asking for it to be crispy). The sausage was cold. Seems they put it onto the griddle frozen and it didn't cook all the way or something. The pancakes alone are okay. The thing about pancakes, waffles and French toast are they are only as good as their syrup. Well the syrup is the cheapest tasting syrup substitute I've ever had. You can taste the sugar/ corn syrup in it. It has no smoky or mapley flavor to it (not even fake flavor). \n\nService is fine. Nothing to get excited about. Maybe 3/5 stars. The food is just so horrible that it brought the rating down that much. \nMy family and I have decided we will not return unless there are no other options. My warning is just because you had it before doesn't mean it is close to the same. I mean there wasn't even a piece of orange or parsley or melon on my plate like there usually is when you order breakfast at any other breakfast place"
"2","German pancakes, Swedish pancakes, one side of sausages, two coffees for. $34.  Way too high for OK food.  Long wait to get table when only few customers eating and had to ask someone to send waitress to take order.  Would not return."
"1","Had the worst experience I've ever had in my life. General manager was super rude when I asked him to substitute pancakes to something  else, he said he have to charge me but He can give me maybe a \""SLICE OF TOMATO\"" for free. \""In his own words\""  Like seriously, was that necessary & having a attitude on Saturday afternoon & you happen to be the GENERAL MANAGER? No wonder this place gets bad reviews. It's these people make the restaurant look bad. But food can't save this Original pancake house ANYWAY. I fell the like the GM hated his job & didn't want to be here. For food, Worst taste of pancakes I've ever had. WILL NOT RETURN back to this place ever."
"4","Items Selected:\nChocolate Chip Buttermilk Short Stack\nChallah French Toast\nBaked Apple Pancake\n\nTechnically a chain, with origins in Portland OR and the famous Walker Bros location in Wilmette IL, it was only when Groupon offered a discount that I realized Las Vegas even had an Original Pancake House and although I guess it could be said that the $8 discount was the impetus for my visit, in reality it was fond childhood memories that drew me through the doors.  Located on Fort Apache, and thus less than ten minutes from my door, it was after another long morning run that I arrived at the sizeable storefront and although the clock had just ticked past 7:15am I entered the restaurant to find the place already lively, a quartet of tables already seated while two couples before me checked in with a friendly hostess soon leading them to their seats.  Eventually finding my place at a booth best suited for four it was mere seconds before my server stopped by and with my order pre-decided based on past experience a simple request that plates arrive in two courses was granted, the long cooking time of the later assuring a fifteen minute delay between rounds.  Sipping on water as the restaurant continued to fill it would not be long before first plates arrived and although the restaurant's eponymous buttermilk batter was fluffy as ever beneath a mountain of whipped cream it was the house-baked challah that truly impressed, the exterior rendered crispy while the center was soaked in sweet custard playing counterpoint the rich egginess of soft bread.  Admittedly a substantial start, and nearly enough to use up my gift certificate, there was simply no way I was leaving Original Pancake House without ordering one of their signatures and this time opting for the Baked Apple Pancake over the Dutch Baby I'll simply say that one cannot go wrong with either, the piping hot pile of thinly sliced Granny Smith's teaming with cinnamon and sugar atop a buttery golden base proving as much a 'pie' as it does a pancake, but absolutely delicious regardless of what it is called.\n\nIndividually owned and operated but similar in menu from coast-to-coast there is simply 'something' about Original Pancake House that makes me smile - the service ever pleasant, the space always bustling, and the apple pancake always served so hot that you *know* the first bite is likely to end in a blistered mouth.  Obviously a bit more expensive than IHOP or Denny's but also using superior ingredients including 93-score butter, pure whipping cream, and free-range eggs it's good to know that every once in a while you can indeed find a taste of 'home,' even a thousand or more miles away."
"5","The food was excellent. Vegetarian omelets and banana and pumpkin pancakes. Our server, Mary was amazing, attentive and very accommodating and caring.. We will certainly be back again. Thanks Mary and thanks Original Pancake House,"
"1","Apparently, my wife and I are invisible! We arrived at about 1:30 on a Thursday afternoon, pleased to see so many cars parked in the lot. The place is divided into separate rooms for dining and for a bar area. We went into the eating area and waited, and waited, but no one ever came. The one couple who were eating said to just take a table and the waitress would be in. After more waiting,a group of 5 entered the eating area. They were immediately seated, given menus, and had their drink orders taken. The waitress never acknowledged that we were present, carefully putting her back to us when she waited in the other people. \nThere are too many other great places in Vegas to tolerate this. We left and found one."
"4","5 dollar foot long"
"3","First time here ... it was alright. i ordered the chicken kabob nothing special and nothing bad. The service seemed kinda slow. Chicken was tender the rice tasted buttery. Give it a try you might like it. For me i think i will pass next time."
"3","Awesome service here! The lady who took my order was very kind and helpful! I LOVE it when I have great service at any place (shops, restaurants, etc)\n\nI wanted to eat outside and she was more than willing to bring my food out side for me (after I told her I was eating inside when ordering.) But I decided to be spontaneous since it was a nice day out (yet windy.)  One of the many reasons why I had to go back in to give them a tip $, since it was rather windy outside. I'll be back! :) I forgot to use the 10% check in offer though... :( oh well, next time!\n\nBtw... the food was great, I had the greek salad. It was more than enough, huge plate of salad and huge slices of lamb and the sauce automatically came on the side. :)"
"1","WORST JEWELER IN TOWN.... I purchased a ring from my Jewler in California and brought it in to get resized... Something as simple as that and thought I could trust them to do it... They seem like a trustworthy Jewler... So I thought. When I went back to pick up my ring the Jewler in the process had scratched the glass on the ring they said that they would fix it..  When I came back almost a month and a half later my beautiful ring was ruined. I got it back with the jewlers finger print on the inside of the glass and epoxy visible on the glass... When I complained and told them they need to fix or replace my ring the response I got was \""you would have damaged it anyway\""... I was pissed and grabbed my ring and left... Worst experience and customer service... I will never go to them again nor will I refer anyone I know to go there... \nArisa Thepprasit"
"4","The foods not for fast food Chinese. It's not as greasy as some that I've had before, so it passes."
"4","This place is very good and has good quality and service and great cocktails."
"5","California comes to Vegas! This place is like the restaurants in California, but better. It's open 24/7 363 days a year (closed on Easter and Christmas) I'm usually here on there graveyard shift or sometimes early dinner. Great food and affordable. Look for discounts in the Entertainment Book!"
"4","Used to shop this CVS almost everyday when I lived just a couple of footsteps away. The supervisor that was there, Lisa, was really cool and like a friend. Not certain she is still there. The rest of the staff is pretty cool too.\n\nStore is always clean and neat and they typically have some of the best fire sales outside of grocery stores and liquor stores.\n\nWhen I lived out here two years ago, they did have a reputation of hiring some seedy folks. Had one, I'm pretty certain, steal my debit card number and my niece and sister both told stories of checkers offering you everything you were buying for free if you'd slip them a $20 spot.\n\nOutside of that, I like the honest employees and the convenience of being of walking distance when I lived out here."
"5","I stopped to get a quick bite to eat and wasn't disappointed. Beef chow mein is delcious,  it's not the bland stuff you'll find at similar joints.  Orange chicken is also A grade.  Service was quick to us and quick to deliver."
"5","I ordered the garlic chicken dinner special, so good, they packed the take out container, it was so much food! Saved half for later :)"
"1","Really not good. I would never come back here. The wait staff was attentive but the food was gross. I don't know why they have an overall 4 stars."
"5","We have been taking our pets to the vet at American Pet Hospital for more than 8 years.  Recently, our beloved family dog became ill with cancer and we had to put him to sleep.  The entire staff at APH was amazing throughout the entire experience, from diagnosis, to our last trip.  Today, we received a sympathy card from them in the mail.  Our hearts were touched, but imagine how surprised we were to open that card and see that many of the staff members had written personal messages to us!  (We often used their boarding services, so many of the staff members had spent time with our dog.)  The time and attention they gave us was amazing.  I would highly recommend American Pet Hospital.  They are truly wonderful, caring people!"
"4","Very nice staff. I really enjoyed my experience here and will definitely bring my dog back for her routine care."
"5","this place is so delicious and cheap.  Very friendly and fast.\n\nAsk for no MSG and free delivery.\n\nThey give you a lot of food.  great for a local neighborhood thai place."
"5","This place is great. When we first went there, we weren't sure how the food would be, but we were extremely happy with the quality & amount of food, and the pricing was great, too. You can get several dinner specials for just $7.95 +tax, which comes with a drink, soup, and an egg roll.\n\nThe main reason I'm so impressed with Mr. Chop Chop, though, is that when my other half went in the other night to pick up dinner, the owner pointed out that we were just in the day before. He mentioned that I wasn't feeling well, and the owner told him to wait a moment. She went in the back and made me a bowl of vegetable soup from scratch. We go to a lot of restaurants on a regular basis, but none of them have ever done that for us. \n\nMr. Chop Chop is fantastic all around. Go there, you won't be disappointed. :)"
"2","Totally hole in the wall type of restaurant. \n\nI had a calamari appetizer and pad thai. The calamari was really good but the sauce needs to be a bit spicier. The pad thai was not great, the noodles was too chewy. I thought it was undercooked. \n\nThe price is perfect, not that expensive for their lunch specials. BUT quality is just not that good for me."
"3","This place came highly recommended from a co-worker but we ended up being disappointed. We showed up at 6:45 and they were already cleaning the grill for the night.. not sure when they close, but we probably should have taken it as a sign and kept walking. \n\nBecause it was \""late\"" we could only get sandwiches.. no fries, etc. Luckily you get to eat in a gas station, sooo you do have a great selection of chips.. whoo. The steaks were just OK. At $6.95 for a small, they are a tad pricey and honestly I think capriottis makes a better steak. Skip this one."
"5","There are no \""sandwich artisans\"" here, just friendly people who care about what they put across their counter.  If you are looking for a place where you are served with a smile by people who really take pride in their work, then this place is for you.  The bread is great and the sandwiches taste like they should.  This is a great kept secret in town and it's too bad.  They could compete with any of the chain locations.  It has an old school neighborhood feel and you can't get away from the charming staff.  This is a family run joint with a family feel.  If I want to get a bite at a place with character, this is where I go.  \nDo yourself a favor and get the roast beef sandwich.  You will thank yourself for it."
"2","So this review has nothing to do with the food as my sandwich was delicious. However, the service rubbed me the wrong way.  I came to order some lunch with a coworker and was next in line to order. A man, who I assume was a regular customer, was standing behind me. Rather than take my order the cashier asked the man behind me what he wanted that day and completely ignored the fact that I was standing right in front of her. It was SO rude!  Way to wow a new customer. I won't be going back. There are plenty of other options in that area for lunch that offer much better customer service. The food wasn't so good that I would tolerate bad customer service for a sandwich. Off to Subway!"
"3","The creamy shrimp soup is an absolute must have.  Everything else I've had is good but a little expensive for your average Chinese restaurant.  Staff is always friendly."
"4","Service was good fast and just like I like it and those who've read me know I like my cheese stakes"
"5","My brother, his girlfriend and I went here and were so impressed. The couple who run the center were knowledgeable, friendly and so helpful. They have a true passion for inspiring people to be climbers. As a novice, I found many routes  I enjoyed and challenged me. I highly recommend this gym!"
"4","The Place is nice the bartenders are good at there job descent food and separate smoking area"
"3","Better than taco bell"
"1","Staff is rude food is not good. I have been there a few times and have had to take fries back because they were so old or had to go get the rest of my order. Go to another one much better service and better food"
"1","Yuk! Couldn't even chew the steak. I love del taco but never have I experience such a disgusting meal. Didn't get past the first bite."
"4","How to describe the Longhorn....It is Vegas's version of the neighborhood dive bar. small, crowded, smoky (but it isn't), but for some reason it's comfortable...The really reason for coming here is the food, seriously, I have been eating here for 20 plus years and have yet to have a bad meal, the ribs are good, the specials can be great, though understand, you're paying $9 for steak and lobster, you will never get prime steak and you will never get a large lobster tail for that price, a reality check is needed by some.\n\nAnyways, the food is good, the drinks are cheap, the gambling is low limit and they do offer live entertainment.\n\nGive it a shot, just walk in thinking that you are about to visit that redneck cousin at his trailer park in Kansas (His name is probably Eddy) and you will leave happy...\n\nThough here the burgers have beef in them, not ketchup."
"3","This review is for the Casino at the Longhorn.  I've never stayed in the motel part, and the restaurant is actually called the Chuckwagon.  I already left my review for it there.  Seriously, check out my review.  The Chuckwagon restaurant is a Vegas staple.\n\n-----\n\nI have given up Gambling (I like craps, blackjack, and video poker just a little too much) but before i quit, the Longhorn was one of my favorite places to play.  They have a lot of slots and video poker, with much better payout rates than the Strip or Fremont. (Slots are always a bad bet, but if you are going to play slots, don't do it in the touristy areas...stick to the locals places with better payouts)  \n\nTheir pit is 3 tables, but rarely do they have more than 2 tables open.  They have $2 blackjack with the \""lucky ladies\"" side bet available 24 hours a day, and their odds are great.  They actually allow surrender and unlimited splitting of cards, but also allow you to double down on your third card if you so choose.   (so if you have 7, hit and draw a 4 to give you 11, they will still let you double to try for 21. AMAZING)  No other Casino in town allows for that rule, and it decreases the overall house advantage by quite a bit.\n\nthe drinks are usually poured pretty stiff, but that depends on the bartender who is working.  Their cocktail waitresses are friendly, but understaffed, so it sometimes takes a while to get drinks - especially on weekends when they get pretty busy. \n\nThe performers they get in the evenings are sometimes good, but often sound like fairly bad karaoke.  They have a good time though, so it's still fun to sit and drink and play.\n\nThe seats are comfortable, and the place is usually clean and well kept, but it is OLD.  Expect an old dive bar locals joint, not something classy you'd find on the Strip.  It can get really smokey in there, and even when the place is empty at 4 in the morning, smoke still kind of permeates every surface.  If smoke bothers you, this is DEFINITELY not the place for you, but i still love it."
"5","old school Vegas there's not to Many of these left.Portions and food are great for the price (All I'm saying is the food is good for the price) The bar is a bit older the bar tenders are nice and easy to talk to and the beer and shots  are cheap  good place for the money only cons are the smoke (it gets in your cloths) and the occasional boulder highway scum that ventures in."
"1","No, no, no, no no!!!\n\nNo water except on jug on each nine. Saw cart girl once in four hours. Greens are terrible. Bumpy, no grass, poorly maintained. I'd never play this course again"
"5","I don't golf.  But I live here."
"2","I can't say I was thrilled with Billy Bob's Steakhouse, but its probably because i ordered the wrong dish: Coconut Chicken Tenders...definitely not a great combination. Service was great, our waiter Toni was a total sweetheart. Virgin strawberry margaritas are delish (a little on the tangy side, just the way I like it). I feel like the menu was a little lacking...perhaps I'm just not cut out to be a meat and potatoes girl."
"2","Talk about bait and switch. Ads said prime rib dinner $9.99, steak and lobster dinner $11.99, steak and sea food dinner $13.99, etc. So we show up ask for the prime rib dinner, no prime rib dinner here, it's at the buffet... Strike one.  Ok steak and lobster dinner $11.99 ... It's not available until 8pm. Strike two.  Ok, steak and sea food dinner $13.99 ...  We'll that's part of the early bird special.. It's 6 pm - strike three -your out!  No early bird, no late bird, no prime rib. We end up having the queen cut prime rib and the chef's special, orange roughy. This included a soup/salad and bread.  Overall the prime rib was ok a bit over cooked. The roughy was good, although the orange flavor was a bit much after awhile. Bottom line: food was ok but the price was a bit much for what we received. Hoping for the special and getting an overprice meal doesn't give you a good taste in the overall experience."
"1","Well my wife and decided to try Willy and Jose's again. We first ate there about 6 yrs ago. So we decided to try it again.\nThis second visit 6 tears later confirms it. What an awful place.\nThey served us the usual tortilla chips, salsa and bean dip.  The chips were old and hard. Bean dip .... Nothing to crow about. Salsa tasted canned.  The wife ordered a strawberry margarita. More strawberry syrup and not enough booze. $ 8.00 for a $ 2.00 drink.\nWife ordered chicken enchiladas with mole. She enjoyed it.\nI ordered a 3 item combo. Pork tamale tasted fine but it was covered with a poor canned tasting enchilada sauce; the chili relleno was filled with cheese reminiscent of Velveeta or Cheese Whiz..the relleno was a little bit over fried.. And the flauta was not crispy at all. Soft like a enchilada. \nService was okay but it could not makeup for the dismal food. \nI'm definitely not a fan. Won\""t go back. Roberto's greasy Mexican food is heads above the garbage served at Willy & Jose's."
"1","Eek! Methinks not indeed. Is this place for you? Here's a checklist. If you like plates fresh out of the dishwasher that are still hot with crusted food on them, and this was with multiple plates, this is your buffet. If you are extremely sodium deficient this is your buffet. If you like carved meats that make you wish for a meat tenderizer to beat them with this is your buffet. If you like semi-frozen out of the box desserts this is definitely your buffet. Go slow on your drinks as getting a server to refill it is next to impossible. When you walk in there are Zagat rated signs on the wall, with all due respect this place isn't worthy of being rated by Zagat. Your best bet is to stay on Boulder Highway and find someplace else to eat. One positive was the stir fry station manned by competent and friendly staff. It's the only thing that warrants a star."
"1","This place used to have awesome food.  It was a great buffet.  Then the location changed and I am guessing the cooks did too.  The food was terrible.  Buffets in Las Vegas that are good are slammed with people even the mediocre ones have lines.  This place, was dead at 7 pm on a Wednesday.  We go out to eat on Wednesdays and we sometimes go to Buffets.  When we do go to Buffets they are slammed with people and have long lines.  This place you just walk right on up, pay you money and go grab a plate.  Problem is, is that buffets rely on turn over so the food doesn't just sit under the heat lamps and get old.  This place had nothing but food under the heat lamps that looked old.  They had Prime Rib but every last piece of it was cooked well done.  The whole place was terrible food.  To many good buffets in town with a comparable price to eat here."
"2","I rarely leave poor reviews, but I came away quite disappointed with this buffet. I remember coming here many times years ago and loving it, but it seems they've taken a dive off a cliff. \n\nMy wife and I visited on a Friday night for their $20 seafood buffet. We tried the crab legs, New York steak, sushi, chow mein, broccoli beef, and tacos. Nothing we ate even came close to average. You're better off finding somewhere else to eat. The service was good, though. So there's that."
"3","My reccomendation: Italian Cheese Bread\n\nMaybe I got there right after a big rush or something because absolutely nothing was \""hot-n-ready\"". I had to wait for my pizzas and italian cheese bread. Took about 15-20 minutes. \n\nI don't expect gourmet quality for a 5 dollar pizza, but geez, if they charged as much as other pizza places then Little Caesars would go out of business QUICK. Little Caesars pizza is strictly for someone looking for cheap/quick food. I honestly think most pizzas found in your local grocery store's freezers taste leagues above Caesars. \n\nThe Italian cheese bread is really good though. It is by far better tasting than the pizza but make sure you grab plenty of napkins and are stocked up on Proactiv because this dish's main ingredient is grease with a side of oil.\n\nCustomer service was good. The guy was very nice and funny. He was very apologetic for making me wait and even threw in a free bag of Crazy Bread."
"1","This is the worst hobby store in the valley Dave the manager or owner or whoever he is will rob you completely blind of every part that he wants and replace it with parts that look exactly the same as your parts but downgraded he took my truck home without my permission then conveniently went on vacation when he got back from vacation my truck was completely downgraded but then he tried to make me believe that I was seeing things even though I had video and photos that I taken before I took it in to prove otherwise. My truck went in there with one simple fix and came out with a cracked frame which was a nice frame carbon fiber frame, completely different and smaller parts, glued together pieces screws that were not even Titans my whole caught my whole truck is loose I used to be able to drop this truck from a two story balcony and it would land without a sound now if I were to drop it off A second-story balcony my truck would shatter it was running when I went in now it won't even start. I beg of you do not take your stuff here go see Eddie on the west side on Sahara he is marvelous he will help you and show you everything he's doing while he's doing it and help you in steps along the way."
"3","Attending the Cinemark Century Theatres at Sam's Town for the first time was an enjoyable experience. Although the slightly rocking chairs look well used, carpeting appears to be fairly new and sight lines are very good. My wife and I saw \""Midnight in Paris,\"" and the visual images reflected on the slightly curved screen from a digital projector were crystal clear, and the sound from multiple speakers loud. First Look was shown, and previews and the main attraction started on time. \n\nTicket prices were reasonable but confusing. They change by day of the week and time. Top price for all but 3D movies was $10.50 for adults; $8.00 for military members, veterans, and students; and $8.00 for Seniors aged 62 and higher. The concession stand was well stocked with edible choices but prices were steep. Bulk candy goes for $10.80 per pound, and it doesn't take too many spheres of chocolate or other sweet treats to quickly mount in accumulated weight. Restrooms are conveniently located near individual screening rooms in this 18-screen movie complex, but paper towels on the counter during my two visits were in a messy, partially wet state. This was a 3-1/2-star experience."
"4","The food was very good and tasty. Portions were big and priced reasonably."
"5","I like what this place does for my nails; especially my toenails. They are thick and hard to deal with at times. Whenever I ask for a design, they always accommodate and have not been rough on me at all."
"1","I went to ER with terrible pain on my left side and it could barely breathe... My chest Xray was wrongly diagnosed and i was sent home from ER still in total pain... I had never been to the ER in my life so i went home thinking maybe i was being a baby about the pain.... 2 days later i woke up in the middle of the night in so much pain even worse than before... I told my husband to drive me to the ER and he was like \""Why, they didn't admit you last time?\"" I told him i don't care and to take me NOW.... I get there and they bring me back for another chest Xray and my left lung was almost collapsed... The ER thanked me for coming back so soon.... Shame on St Rose and Shame on Radiology Associates of Nevada .... Now i owe them tons of money .... they almost cost me my life and now they are sending me bill after bill... I feel that if i was diagnosed properly the first ER visit that i would not of spent 3 WEEKS IN THE HOSPITAL!!!"
"1","This is for their pharmacy...don't bother. \nThese days they are offering a 10% off coupon if you get your flu shot.  OK.\nI stood in line 17 minutes on a Wednesday afternoon just to get a form to sign.  I was told they didn't have any coupons, but I could leave my name and they would call me to come back for it.  Excuse me?  You have signs everywhere promoting this, but you can't figure out some way to give me the 10% off you are advertising because you don't have that exact piece of paper that magically reads 10% off???\nAfter the 17 minute wait, I was told to wait in the adjoining room.  It had a tv with mellow images of people doing yoga and the absolutely dirtiest carpet I have seen in years.  Eeew!\nThen I sit there for another 21 minutes!!!!  Plenty of time to type an unfavorable review of their customer service.  Because if they don't have the capacity to handle walk-in flu shots at 3:00 in the afternnoon on a weekday, they shouldn't bother doing it.  The shot itself took 20 seconds and they \""found\"" a coupon for me when they realized I was upset.  But no apology for the wait.\nI would not want them handling any important medications for me."
"5","On the 12th day of Christmas...\n\nI thought it only fitting to review my church on Christmas Day.  We've been parishioners at SEAS for over 19 years.  My son attended first through eighth grade at their school. I've seen the parish grow from being in trailers to the build out of the church, school, and chapel.  We've experienced a great deal of controversy and heartbreak in the past two years with our former pastor.  All through this turmoil, the congregation is still strong, as I'm sure it would be in any other church, regardless of the denomination, where its parishioners have faith.  Roman Catholic or not, the priests and staff are welcoming to all who come to worship, always making a point to acknowledge anyone who may be visiting for a service.  DeeDee, the musical director, has a singing voice like an angel and I always hope she's singing at the masses that I attend.  I'm no holy roller by any means, but if you're looking for a Catholic church to attend on this side of town, give St. Elizabeth's a try.  Peace :)"
"1","If you want a doctor and staff who doesn't make you feel uncomfortable and won't make you dread having to take your child in for a visit, do not go here. I was a month late taking my infant daughter at the time to take her shots and Dr. Nauman would make a negative comment towards me for being late. I never felt comfortable going there. I wish I had found Dr. Marlon Mendoza much sooner."
"1","Just AWFUL...  I was in town for a Bridal Shower and the service was horrible!!  There was only 12 of us women and they couldn't get it together.  They forgot to bring out 2 salads and missed 3 entrees.  Our waiter Kevin was the worst and the manager Kelly was non-responsive.  DO NOT ever plan a party here.  I felt bad for the bride.  The day was supposed to be about her, but everyone was focused on the slow, lousy, rude service"
"2","When I enjoy the appetizers more than my entree, and have to wait a substantial amount of time between appetizers to my entree I think there is a problem.\nI usually don't like to rate bad, but personally I didn't enjoy my dinner.\nIt seems like a great place to nibble and drink mostly."
"5","Wine selection is FANTASTIC!\nThis place is a hidden gem among those of us who love good food paired with good wine. \nService is OK when it gets busy Good when things are slow. I have had lunch and dinner there for a couple of years now and have never been disappointed."
"5","This restaurant is a jewel in the city of Las Vegas. I urge all to experience a meal here. I am surprised at the wide range of flavors that come out of one kitchen. I have been here at least 10 times and haven't been disappointed once! Some may comment on the prices at first but once you see the portion sizes such as their veal parmesan portion it is actually a deal! They offer other incentives like coupons on restaurant.com (make sure you read the fine print), and Mondays are half off all bottles of wine. Dine in then tell your friends."
"4","they have a pretty extensive menu, you would find something to eat pretty easy. The appetizers come in pretty big portions and  their food is very Delicious. They also have an extend wine menu."
"1","Terrible! All of the reviews about the poor service were absolutely correct. We went on a Saturday for lunch and there were only a few tables in the restaurant and he appeared as though he was very busy. My mother and I were treated poorly. The server was short with us, had no personality and was not very helpful for this being my first time. The food was below par, the only good thing about it was the free basket if bread that is served with each meal. We had to go inside to get our check because our server was at the bar playing with his phone and talking to a girl. Definitely will not go back!"
"4","I love this place and have been going here for years it's perfect for an intimate date night or even a friends night out.\n\nFirst thing you should know about this gem is that Monday night is 1/2 off bottle wine night and the second thing you should know is that the food is delicious! \n\nWhen you walk in you'll notice a private dining room to the left, the patio to the right and a sweet dimly light dining room with a cool little wine bar right in the middle. Towards the back you'll notice the neatly stored wine. It's pretty quiet and takes you away from the traditional Las Vegas dining scene.\n\nAs far as the food is concerned, you have a nice variety of choices for the vino! Pasta, salads, flatbreads, sandwiches. My favorite thing to grab is the steak salad (sub romaine) it's crisp, flavorful, and very satisfying. Now this is a wine bar so there is no doubt about the selection! They have wine by the glass or the bottle. Not a wine fan? No worries! They have a small yet fabulous beer selection as well.\n\nThe service (minus one experience) is up to par. They are very hospitable and knowledgable! Whether you choose to sit at the bar or at a table it's all the same  \n\nIf you are looking for a new spot, give this place a try! It will probably be a new favorite. Bon appetite!"
"3","I enjoyed a nice manicotti dinner here tonight. We had a group of 12 and I believe everyone enjoyed dinner. Some nice specials were offered. Prices were reasonable."
"5","Best spot in town. This is such a romantic spot to take friends or even family. I fell upon this place over 4 years ago and i keep coming back. Love the wide selection of wine (that I can now drink) and the authentic Italian food. Great place to wine and dine without having to go to the strip. They have also just opened a second location at the Downtown Summerlin Mall. Right next door to me!"
"5","We've been here a couple of times.  Food is always good and so is the service. We'll definitely be back."
"5","It was my first time:\n\nVery attentive staff. \n\nYou will not benefit much from making an appointment because there are only a few techs. You may have to sit in a massage chair & soak for a bit but I don't mind the extra time with a massager at all! \n\nI would like it if they had prices & services I could read up on but I'm not shy or afraid to ask. I was explained very well any questions I had. \n\nI went in at 6 (close at seven) they stayed until almost 8 to make sure everyone was happy. I had an idea of what I wanted going there & I left very satisfied"
"5","I have been seeing Dr. Weisner for various ailments since May of 2000.  He has helped me recover from a serious car injury, and allowed me lead an active an healthy lifestyle.  \n\nAlways very professional and willing to spend time with you.  Great staff as well!"
"4","So this place is poppin!! \n\nI don't really drink SB. So I can't say that I'm a connoisseur for it, but I enjoy a stroowberries & creme every 2nd Friday of the month ;] jk.\n\nThe people are chilled out like ice in my sweet tea. Star 1.\n\nSmells good & looks clean. Star 2.\n\nThe location is pretty sweet. Lots of good eats *ahem In-N-Out* around :] Star 3.\n\nLike I said, it's poppin! Star 4!\n\nOnly dislike is the parking isn't the best. I mean it's too late to do anything about it, but it's part of the review, nah mean? 4 Stars all in all :]"
"4","Small, but had the basics with good quality"
"5","Best grocery store in Vegas!"
"3","I'm conflicted about this Trader Joe's. They are always crowded, I have never been here without encountering entirely too many people, no matter what time of day. I try to avoid coming here when I can, but the good part about this Trader Joe's is that it's larger and better stocked than the other locations in town. I'm not a fan of the layout of the store. It's long and there are essentially three long aisles that span the entire length of the store, which is a little awkward.\n\nI don't make it to this Trader Joe's too often, but when I'm looking for something I can't usually find at my local store, I make the trek to this side of town."
"4","This trader joes is awesome!! Its not that much larger than the others but I feel like this particular one has more of a selection of items then the others do. Clean as all trader joes usually are. Staff was very friendly and helpful. It was very busy but I guess its no surprise as this trader joes is a great one!"
"1","I had a crazy acne flare up a few years ago.  I researched derms and found a lot of good reviews about Dr. Aspacio.\n\nWhen he came in to the exam room, he seemed rushed and acted like I was taking up his time by telling him my dermatological history.  I told him that I had tried a certain medication for my acne, but didn't like it because it made my skin raw and peely, and asked if he could make a suggestion for another solution.  So what does he prescribe?  That same medicine I had just told him I didn't want to use again.\n\nDid you not hear what I said 10 seconds ago?  I just said it made my skin RAW!!  When I told him this again, he responded, \""Well, you must be applying too much.  It's the gentlest medication there is, so there's nothing else I can give you.\""  He wrote the prescription and walked out.  I felt so uncomfortable at his chiding and found him to be one of the rudest doctors I've ever experienced.  No one should feel that way when it comes to a professional taking care of your body.  Everyone deserves much more than that.\n\nI took his prescription, threw it out, and found another dermatologist who actually listened to my concerns and cleared my acne with another medication that didn't leave me looking like my face was coming off."
"3","This location of Jimmy John's is a regular lunch stop when I am working in the Northwest. Clean shop, friendly staff, quick service.\n\nI love turkey, I don't like ham or super salty meats (read: Italian meats) on my sandwiches (except bacon of course!). Jimmy John's has a nice selection of sandwiches with turkey on them. Here are my faves:\n\nTurkey Tom - simple...turkey, cheese, regular fixins\nBeach Club - turkey, cheese, avo, cukes, sprouts...a California Girl's sandwich dream\nClub Lulu - turkey, bacon, regular fixins\nBootlegger - turkey, roast beef, regular fixins\n\nFresh ingredients, good portion of meat (for me), lots of veggies, extra peppers please! Quality sandwich place."
"1","Ugh. Got the Italian Night Club to go. Asked for the mayo and dressing on the side. Was told they are not able to do that. They have no Dixie cups. Really? They finally found something to put it in. Shouldn't have bothered anyway. Was just oil n vinegar. Made my own dressing at home. Bun was a glorified hot dog bun. Smh."
"1","I used to love the veggie sandwiches here until I found out what I was supporting by eating here. Jimmy John is one of those people that use their money for evil. He pays a lot of the money that comes from this chain to go to Africa and shoot exotic animals. Beautiful elephants and cheetahs. Google it if you need to see for yourselves. Sandwiches are not that damn good. I'm disgusted. Boycott JJ."
"1","I would rather go to Walmart on Christmas Eve than go to this Kmart at its slowest time. Took me 40 minutes and four employees to get the item I ordered online to pick up in store. Did I mention the ten minute wait to even get someone to the help counter because the 8 cashiers they had were too enthralled in a riveting conversation.... Never again."
"5","Both dr Martin and swainston are amazing but they are way overcrowded. I'm a little concerned about getting seen and what will happen when I go into labor. When you do see them thy give you their full attention."
"1","This trip to the ER was the worst I've ever experienced. I'll spare you the gory details and just give the highlights. \n\nWhen checking me in they did everything but call me a liar. They treated me like a junky trying to get some painkillers. They shrugged off my discharge papers from Urgent Care. I sat in the waiting room for a total of 4 hours. I got an external and intra-vaginal ultrasound, just to hear the CT Scan guy talking to another ultrasound guy about how I wasn't actually in pain at all. They insisted on giving me a CT Scan, telling me radiation wasn't involved. Liar. I refused. \n\nAfter another 1 1/2 hours of sitting in the waiting room, they finally bring me down what felt like every hallway in the entire hospital; which, by the way are all in midi-construction AND lined with patients laying in beds moaning and groaning - with handwritten signs above their head stating which 'room' they are in. \n\nThe lady at the desk, turns out to be a nurse - she tells me to put on a hospital robe because I'm having a pelvic exam. an hour later when a male nurse comes in, he looks at me like I'm crazy because I'm half-naked. He hooks me up to a blood pressure machine and heart rate monitor and shuts the lights off on his way out because he says \""You'll be here a while\""...it's already been 6 hours. \n\nThe doctor finally comes in and talks to me about my gall stone history...you know, the one I don't have. Then he says, \""Well, looks like there's nothing wrong with you - you can go!\""\n\nNever again."
"1","Well we waited for a room to open in the ICU. My bf is nearly having a heart attack in one of the rooms of the ER.  One of the nurses comes in the room, gets on the phone and describes to the person on the other line that she has a \""train wreck\"" coming through. Aka my bf. Nice."
"1","Wanted to try Beach Pizza, since it's closer than the place I usually go to, Roccos NY Pizza.  Large 3 item Pizza, chicken parm sub, and an order of buffalo wings.  \nThe whole order of food, was sub-par, at best.  The buffalo wings, were terrible, smelled weird, oily, little wing sauce, ate a few, dumped the rest.  The Chicken Parm sub was mushy with too little chicken and too much sauce and cheese.  The pizza was kinda like Dominos, cardboardy crust, not the worst ever, but far from good.  For the prices, not a real good value.  For 1/2 the price, might be worth consideration for folks who usually order Pizza-Hut, Dominos, or Papa John's.\nNice friendly staff and fast service, was the only bright spot.  Will not return."
"1","*No one wears gloves here* I came here the evening of Friday Nov. 21, to get some pizza, fast. I asked the girl at the register How much a large cheese pizza is.  She said \""That'll be $12.92\"". I asked how much 2 medium cheese pizzas are,  she said \""$12.95\"". I ordered the two pizzas, paid, and said I'd be back. The girl at the register told me it would be 15-20 minutes.\n  I returned to a line of two people, less than 15 minutes later. I waited in the line for over 10 minutes, staring at my pizzas that were waiting on the shelf for me. As I was waiting, I watched an employee, a girl in a green apron, placing parchment in the box, where she was about to place the pizza, she pressed, with here bare hand, down on the middle of the paper, then placed a pizza someone was going to eat right on top. I looked at the other employees in the kitchen,  one was on the back of the oven, not gloved and another working in the kitchen, also not gloved. Of the four employees working there, zero wore gloves.\nWhen I got to the front of the line the girl asked what she could do for me. The restaurant wasn't that busy,  I feel like she should've remembered me. It was very irritating to wait in line for paid for pizzas.\nThe pizza was average. None of us have the stomach flu yet."
"1","This use to be one of my favorite pizza places till it took over an hour for my Delivery to get to me and then they charged my credit card and when it got to me they tried to make me pay cash when I already paid. I'm not happy with the service I have received from them and this will be the last time I order from them. I don't feel it is Appropriate to charge your customers twic"
"4","I love Roberto's and this happens to be right by my house so I come here all the time. The food always comes out fast and they always get my order right.\n\nThis location is old and the decor is dumpy ...but I don't go to Robertos for the ambiance."
"1","I would give negative stars if possible. Absolute worst experience ever. I contacted Wardley real estate because I found a house I was interested in while browsing on realtors.com. I contacted the listing agent.  And was linked up with the worst realtor ever Greg Hicks. He was the most unprofessional agent I have had to deal with. Not once during the Three month period of my short sale did he contact me to update me on anything. I had to call him and when I did he never had an answer for me he always said \"" I'm going to have to ask the selling agent, I'll get back to you\"" but he never would. So I finally began contacting the selling agent Jennifer hill who is the 2nd worst realtor ever!. She was very unresponsive never returning my messages. Finally when my purchase agreement expired I quickly canceled my agreement a requested my earnest deposit back which took them weeks to even get them to get the owner to sign (BS).  They gave me the run around constantly and were full of it. If I ever see a property listed under Wardley I will run the other way. Oh ...and Jeff Sommers was of no assistant as well. Wardley real estate is a complete fail."
"4","What can I say...this used to be my regular as it was cheaper for dinner for two here than cooking on your own.  It's still OK.  Full of Dell Web residents if you get there for an early dinner.  Love Mirna, the waitress that has been there for years!"
"3","My husband and I go to this place mostly for the monday special which is a half chicken dinner now priced at 7.49.   When it was 5.99 years ago, half of Sun City were lining up out the doors.   Now I guess the place is just not as packed. \n\nWe decided to have a BURGER instead of the chicken.   However, they have TWO parts to the burger section on the menu.   One is a Make your own additions to the burger each 50 cents for $5.99 and another section below for different prices which come from 7.99 and up.   These have certain items such as bacon, bleu cheese, jaleponos etc.      I just wanted a burger, medium rare with cheddar cheese and my husband just wanted it plain.   We asked what does it come with and it has a choice of steak fries, potato salad, coleslaw etc.      I failed to ask what also comes on the burger. \n\nWhen we got the burgers, I looked for the cheese and found a small melted quarter size spot on the burger, lettuce and two slices of tomato and a pickle on the side. \n\nThe burger was slightly pink, I like it rarer, and was very thin although it was supposed to be 1/2 pound.   It was also VERY dry tasting.    \n\nWhen we got the bill I asked the server, what happened to the cheese? She said she ordered it with cheese, but I couldn't even see 2 cents worth.    Then we saw we were charged 7.99 and 8.50.     She said because it came with lettuce and tomato, we were charged extra.   What a rip off!   Burger bun just okay.  will NEVER order a burger there again!"
"4","This is a nice BK.  The building has been remodeled and looks great.  The inside is pretty and looks very modern.  They have the usual seating as well as a little cove with couches and cushy seats to sit and have a coffee.  The playground area is nice and big.  It is 2 stories with a lot of room for the kiddos to run around in.  There is pretty limited seating for adults though with only 3 tables available.  Another bonus was the new automated soda machine.  I love these machines and the abundance of soda choices.  Yummy!  Overall it was a nice BK as compared to the others I have visited."
"1","Worst doctor office. Do not go here. Very rude costumer service and do not care about patient health. By far one of the worst experiences I have ever had."
"1","I would give them zero stars if it were possible. \n\nMy wife tore her ACL on a Saturday, went to the ER. Visited her PCP the following business day to get a referral.  SW Medical sent her here. They initially told her they couldn't see her until FOUR MONTHS LATER!!!! I fought through their BS after hours of hold times and finally got an appointment to see someone three weeks after the injury, only to have them cancel on her the business day before the appointment. What A-holes! They pretty much told us to go F ourselves....What is the reason you ask for cancelling? Apparently, they aren't contracted with the ER that she went to (even though our insurance is) and that is where the HMO sent us-so they refused to treat her. \n\nIn a way this review is unfair because she never actually got to see any of their doctors, but I am just giving you the facts of what happened and how terribly we were treated by the staff. I have worked for 13 years in healthcare and have never had an office treat me or any of the patients I work with so poorly.\n\nWe contacted our insurance and found another orthopedist who was happy to take our carrier and was able to get her in ASAP, so if your insurance tells you that Nevada  Othopedic and Spine Center is where you should go, tell them to give you other options to avoid a terrible experience like ours."
"4","I had dinner here this week, and while waiting for my dine-in order, I checked on here to see what people had to say.\n\nMy response?  \""Oh, crap.\""\n\nFortunately for me, I didn't have the customer service nightmare that other reviewers had.  So that leads me to believe that the issue must be either with: take-out, delivery, or someone that works here got the memo and decided to work on their customer service techniques.\n\nIf anything, the service was very friendly.  Quick, talkative, checked in often to see how we were doing... they even stopped us when we went to select our drinks as the colder drinks were in the back of their fridge.  Why? They wanted to point those out over the still warm ones they had recently placed in there.  Again, little gestures.\n\nWe got two personal pizzas: Cordon Bleu and Cajun Queen.  And those were some really tasty 'zas, especially sharing between ourselves.  Someone else on here pointed out this place's wings, and I am a HUGE wing enthusiast.  These are definitely some mighty fine wings.  I ate those like they were going out of style.\n\nI don't know what to say: The meal was really good, the service contradicted the other reviews on here (which was a relief for us), and yes, the prices are a little high, but the quality and variety was there."
"5","Best pizza I've found in Summerlin. Lots of fresh toppings and great flavor. Not the cheapest pizza, but worth it."
"1","Stopped in for a few slices after not dining here for several months because the pizza was so bad, and now I remember why I stopped eating here !! The pizza was soggy soaked in grease and just not good. The Pizza is just plain bad here, and even though this place is less then a minute from my house I will not be dining here anymore ..."
"5","Very happy with their pizza.  It's my favorite in the city.  The staff is nice and they know what they're doing.  The owner is also very nice."
"4","The decor is classic dark brew pub. It works. A nice place to hang with your friends or just chill by yourself.\n\nAn above average pub menu. The breakfast menu is pretty good, with lots of choices. We like it - my sweetie loves to come here.\n\nToday we showed up a bit late for breakfast, so we fastened onto the lunch menu. Again,  lots of choices. I went with the \""round mountain\"" roast beef sandwich,  my sweetie went with the Paradise Carnita sandwich. We both had the home made chips,,, my sandwich was okay -- it was as advertised -- but it was kinda bland for my taste. Not Steiner 's fault,  the roast beef sandwich would be killer for someone with a blander palette than mine.  The Paradise Carnita sandwich was absolutely KILLER.\nSo full of flavor -- an awesome choice,  sweetie loved it as did I.  I know what Im ordering on my next visit.  Pulled pork ( carnita style )  with spicy sauce and pico de gallo served on a sweet sourdough roll. Amazing sandwich.\n\nGood selection of beers - on tap and in bottles. Service was good,  and the prices are fair. Recommended."
"1","Hands down the worst service I have ever received from a server in my entire life. She spoke in a very unprofessional manner and in an an impressionable way as if she thought she was some sort of savior or counselor and not a bartender. The truth of the matter is that she is a parrot and repeats complete parroted nonsense that was given to here by a drunken fool. I understand that this is a bar but if you are going to interrogate  every customer that walks in as if you know their life is fact and not the fiction that you have heard from somebody else than I presume it to be completely factual and none the less.  I believe the bartenders name is Sheryl or perhaps\nMax. Either way completely and utter foolish nonsense from these people that treated me like a was less than more than a paying customer. Never again will I return to such a foul mouth Podunk bar in  a big city such as Las Vegas and it is such a shame that I went in there expecting to be treated fairly in the midst of a breakup (where everybody sticks there nose and acts as if it was their business is mine) truly ashamed of the staff at a professional establishment such as Steiner's. It looks as if you should find a staff that is professional and doesn't act like clientele is anything but that. Quite a shame for an establishment that serves such great food."
"3","I usually love coming here for their Homemade Corned Beef Hash and Eggs but this time I was a little upset with the service. All of the times I have been here they would serve their homemade Pumpkin Bread before breakfast but I wasn't even offered any. I thought maybe they ran out so I just let it go until I heard another waitress next to me offer it to another table. I did one of these inner Grrrrr! sounds but it was already too late because I was getting full. My hot chocolate was never refilled even though I do get one refill for free with my order. This is my first experience here where I received less than stellar service so I will not dwell on it. I also noticed that most all of the little knick knacks were replaced with much more modern decor. I preferred the little knick knacks because it gave the place more character now it just feels really superficial."
"4","I recently discovered this location a month ago and am glad that is saves me a drive from the Charleston location I used to frequent.  Even though this location is popular and busy I've always been able to find a seat with minimal wait times.  I was satisfied that it was clean, specials were communicated on the chalk board as soon as you walk in, and everyone is really friendly.\n\nWhat I really enjoy here is the basic breakfast since it's one of my favorite meals, I got the ham and eggs with toast.  Sure what I choose is a basic breakfast but I loved how it's all freshly made and the ham was cooked well and not overly salty.  I've eaten here with friends who've gotten the \""Kitchen Sink Omelet\"" and various sandwiches and everyone has always left full and with boxes for the leftovers.\n\nIf you're up for a clean, friendly, and delicious breakfast/lunch place with friends I'm sure anyone can find something on the menu.  I've already added this to one of my options on weekend mornings."
"4","Banana bread was delicious and the Mediterranean omelet with shrimp and lobster inside was amazing."
"3","As other reviewers stated, service is spotty (polite, but mostly absent, which is strange in a place this size).  Food is good: omelets are LARGE - clearly can be split by 2 regular size folks.  Well prepared and full of good stuff.  \n\nOur sides of the banana bread and pumpkin bread were clearly warmed over which was a little embarrassing for the waitress (who danced around the subject)  But the main course, which was the reason for visiting, hit the mark.\n\nNot easy to get in and out of since you pay at the register (paying during our visit turned into a 10 minute ordeal - it happens).  But, as Yelp says, A-OK."
"4","I've been going to Gold's Gym for a couple months now, and I can say, it's the best gym I've tried in town. I'm a former member of LVAC and 24 Hour, and my experience here is much better.\n\nFirst off, it's $19 a month. No contract. Very affordable and you aren't locked into a 27(?) month plan like LVAC. You can add amenities like tanning, child care, etc...but I have no need for those.\n\nAlso, unlike LVAC, it's never too busy. Yes, from around 8-noon, and again from 4-7 it can be busier than normal, but I've never waited for a machine. They have a great variety of cardio machines, and a good number of weight machines. There is also a big free weight area, but I don't use it very often. \n\nI took my first class there yesterday, and it was great. Bodypump with Annie was a lot of fun, and Annie is a great instructor. I was the only guy in there, but she didn't make me feel out of place. I will absolutely go back again.\n\nI can't comment on the locker room facilities too much, as I rarely use them, but they seem clean and well maintained. They have a sauna. in there, too.\n\nGold's Gym often gets a bad rap. It's looked upon as the gym where all the juice heads go, and where all the girls get hit on. It all the times I've been there, I've only ever seen one douchebag try (unsuccessfully) to hit on a girl. I think it had something to do with his giant blowout. \n\nI knocked off one star due to one minor complaint. A few times I've seen machines that are out of order, and they seem to take a long time to fix them. Nothing too crazy, but can be annoying if you are looking for a particular machine to use.\n\nOverall this is a solid gym, with a little less frills than you would find at the bigger gyms. However, it's less busy, the price is right, and everyone is quite friendly. If you see me there, come say hi. I'll be sweating my butt off on the Crossfit machine."
"2","This was my home gym for a while. Until they switched up management. The place has fallen apart. Manager is rude. Machines are old. It's simply not kept up anymore. Sad because it WAS such a great gym, people were serious about working out there. If you live in the NW area take your money to lvac over the bridge, there is plenty room and equipment and cleaner."
"4","I come here M-Friday. Parking lot can become a nightmare and place is a little small But I come between 2:00-3:30 maybe till 4 and theres less people. I like that they have a side for only women that's a nice feature for people who are easily intimated or shy. Staff or people that come here are not snobby and bathrooms are clean. i pay 20 a month and no contract I can attend the fitness classes at that price if I wished."
"2","I've had two major repair jobs done here and both made me a bit uncomfortable, so I'm not planning to return. Their only diagnosis tool seems to be the computer reporting tool, This leads to things like wanting to replace an entire part of your car (the entire ignition system, transmission, etc.) if they can't identify a [trivial] problem.\n\nWhile they've never done anything that made me suspect they were suggesting things to run up my bill, it seems more like they don't know how to diagnose the specific problem and just 'ripp it out and replace it all' is their modus operandi.\n\nTheir prices are on the high, as well, to the point that they actually 'threw in' some free repairs that I know to be nontrivial after I complained about the amount I'd spent and still didn't have a working vehicle.\n\nLastly, service is extremely slow - both jobs I had them do my mechanic back in TX could've done in a few hours, instead it took them overnight (and I dropped the vehicle off in the morning both times).\n\nI tend to keep my one star reviews for outright scams/food poisoning/etc. -- my review of Big O is just barely above that line."
"1","I came here for a routine oil change... they came back and shoved a bunch of unwanted information at me saying I need to have X and Y changed. The repairs would cost me over 2000, so I said no. Aside from making me feel stupid, when I went to check my oil a couple months later, I realized some screws were missing from underneath the hood. The ones that were there weren't secured properly. And somehow my hood prop rod also magically broke somehow. \n\nAlso, I came here once before that (this is before I noticed the missing pieces) because I noticed my check engine light was on. The first thing they threw at me was a 100 dollar diagnosis check. I could get those at other places for 15 dollars. again when I refused service, the technician just kept giving me the weirdest look like I was the dumbest customer to ever grace his presence. \n\nbottom line: Sub par service and work. I will never come here again even if it is close to my house."
"3","The restaurant was closed to the efforts of the anti-smoking Nazi's. The beer is still great but I miss the food."
"4","Been back a few times since my first review and on a recent visit came for a going away party. \n\nThis was a really good easy going venue to do that. There is plenty of seating, there are billiards, games so everyone could interact. It wasn't overly smoky and it was quiet to carry on conversation. Of course the one downside is there isn't any food, but we had pizza delivered to the spot and they have no problems with people bringing in food. The bartenders here are friendly and actually try to talk to patrons. \n\nEvery beer they brew is pretty solid, with Hoptide being my favorite. They also have a few well selected guest taps each season. \n\nI would say if you have beer geek friends and you want somewhere easy going to hang this is a really good spot to do that. Bring in some food and you're set!"
"3","I'd give this a score of 3 1/2 if I could. Good quality beer. I rated each one 3.75 out of 5 on both BeerAdvocate and Untappd. I was really looking forward to the oatmeal stout, but they were out. Maybe next time. \n\nThere's no food, but good atmosphere and friendly staff."
"1","Horrible. Just plain horrible. Like the other review, get one star cause I have to. Ordered a small chili with cheese. Asked for some chili sauce packets on the side. A spicy chicken sandwich combo with a side of ranch. The wifey was nice enough to get it in the first place, so I can't complain to her. No ranch. No chili sauce. No spoon to eat the chili. No straw for the drink. No napkins to wipe hands with. Did get ketchup for the fries, but didn't eat them because they were colder than the ice in my drink. I was soooooo angry I actually called. The manager offered to give me the stuff if I drove down and pick up the items. There was no mention of a refund or a gift card for a future order. Doesn't matter because I won't be going back."
"5","I love this Wendy's. I have been coming here over the years and never had any problems. my order is always right and piping hot fresh. \n\nThe drive-thru is super speedy and the workers are always friendly. \n\nI recently have become addicted to the chili cheese fries. \n\nYou can't beat there value menu with so many tasty options.\n\nThey regularly send coupons in the mail and all of them or worth using. I got a free spicy chicken sandwich with purchase of a small drink and fries and also I liked the coupon where I got a free chili cheese fries with any purchase. I ordered from the value menu that time and my total was just $2.12 for the fries and 2 sandwiches."
"2","My rule of thumb lately is not to review fast food locations unless they meet following criteria. Service is outstanding or food is amazing. Or my service was horrible etc. I am writing this review in hope management sees this, cause this will freak out alot of people. I ordered some stuff to go. I got burgers and a raspberry tea witch sounded good honestly. The burgers where average bacon was burnt like deep fryer bacon. That wasn't the fries where cold. And the topper I started drinking the drink on the way home witch is like 5 mins even less depending on traffic stop lights sigh -- I will leave those for another story. The drink tasted good however I started noticing hard chunks of something I think maybe mix or something however you can tell there pods with a string attached normally needing to be blended longer so not to leave these is a cup. Espic a white cup that shows up. I dont have food poisoning or any of those signs. However when you see this me being from Phoenix I tend to freak out espic not knowing what I ingested, so I hope management can see this. I do not need any type of reimbursement just letting company know."
"3","$6 exterior car wash, and you can find a $2 off coupon online.  Makes for a cheap car wash, except I have to get out of my car to dry off my car after it's been \""dried.\""  You get what you pay for!"
"1","What the hell. I gave the guy $20 and the gas would only fill up to $19.89.\n\nIt's not about the 11 cents, but the principle of the matter. From my experience, most gas pumps stop before it gets to the full value, but you can always keep pumping until it gets there. This was not the case with this one. The trigger was loose and just wouldn't go anymore. That's kinda fucked up if you ask me."
"3","Just okay.  My husbsnd hated it but I thought it would do in a pinch, but haven't been back in months.  Soups need improvement.  Staff was nice."
"2","This place is sub par.  The service is great and the staff are really friendly but the food is only edible at best.  My wife and I caught an early dinner here last night.  The decor was dated and the other patrons were all probably from Sun City, but whatever.  We ordered the dinner special which comes with soup, appetizers and two main courses.  We received the wonton soup first which was bland.  Then we got out appetizers that consisted of fried wontons, fried shrimp and egg rolls.  They were a bit greasy but edible.  Finally came our main course of orange chicken, mongolian beef and bbq pork fried rice.  The portions were a bit small and the food was flavorless.  I never had orange chicken and mongolian beef that tasted quite like this.  I mean I have had some terrible chinese food before, but the sauce they used for both dishes were pretty unique.  Again, everybody was incredibly nice and I really wanted to like this place, but my taste buds won out.  I know it's hard to find decent chinese food away from the spring mountain area, but there are definitely better than this(although I'm still searching for my go to place)."
"5","I have been going here since I was a little kid. The food had always been consistent and delicious. Even if I haven't been there in a while, the waitress always recognizes me and knows my order. BEST WONTON SOUP EVER!"
"4","This is place is clean the server is very attentive. Food was brought to us within 10/15 after we placed the order. Came for the lunch special they're priced very well. Will definitely come back. Delicious!!"
"1","When I made my appointment and asked for the address of the office I was told it was on Windmill and Pacos, when I asked for an address the man on the other end said its on Windmill and Pacos, that's all you need. Then when I got the reminder phone call the day before the appionmtnt, the lady leaving the message said, at the end, \"" oh, and it's $25 for a no show/no call\"" and hung up. I thought that was a little rude on top of the address thing, THEN on the day of the appointment....my appointment was for 9am, I was told on the message to get there at 8:30 for paper work, I was a little late, arrived at 8:50 and they refused to see me and wanted to reschedule. I told them this was a bad experience from the very start and I would be taking my business elsewhere. I am sure the Dr is a good one, but the staff is extremely rude."
"1","I've been taking my cats to Dr. Steelman for 15 years.  I was always a huge fan of her work in the community.  I am deeply disappointed in my last dealings with that place and Dr. Steelman. My cat was very ill, and you NEVER can reach anyone there. They NEVER return your phone calls. You wait HOURS to pick them up.  Then when you do, if your cat is still sick, and you have questions, THEY STILL DON'T return your calls. HOW SCARY. The receptionist keeps saying we are VERY busy. SO is the VA hospital and people DIE!     If you are VERY BUSY then our poor family members get forgotten.  Vodka Ghilarducci (my 15 year old purr master) pasted away today 5/24/14 of fluid in the lungs and heart.  Rainbow Animal Hospital was able to detect his pain and laboring breathing that was so hard to watch. We chose to do the right thing. I will NEVER GO BACK TO THAT PLACE. After all as they say, \""WE ARE VERY VERY BUSY\""!!!!!  Keep that in mind when you bring your babies there!\n\nHere is THE CLINC'S MISSION STATEMENT:  WE UNDERSTAND THAT YOUR CAT IS AN IMPORTANT MEMBER OF THE FAMILY.    How is this EVEN possible when you DON'T call your clients back? How is this possible when you admit to being TOO busy?   Simple common sense say NOT!"
"2","Wow-wee-wow! I didn't hate this place; I sure liked it a lot better than the previous reviewer (Tiger W.), but it was rather mundane.... 'ho-hum', if you will. Not terrible at all, just nothing special. Good if you're hungry and not looking for a fancy-schmancy experience. I recommend on those terms. Good price."
"3","This is a good sushi bar.  Other reviews say the fish is fresh and they weren't joking.  Its a small place with not much ambience, but if you're going there for good sushi, you won't be disappointed."
"4","This sushi place is great! The rolls were fresh and very tasty!! We also received a complimentary appetizer and a sushi sample, which was a nice surprise! Customer service was great and the food was delicious. \n\nThey don't offer AYCE, but the 4 rolls me and my friend shared were more than enough. I'll make sure to come back here again!"
"4","This place was good and found this on the internet.  Anyways I wished I had the sushi, but I was sick so I went with the noodles which was good. It was nice and hot and filled my belly. I loved the salad as well.  I wished I had the other dishes, but it is okay though.  I would come back here again."
"5","The sushi here is SO good. My favorites include the Japanese lasagna and the vegetable fried rice.  The miso soup is also yummy.  Happy hour here is pretty good too, and if you do check in through yelp, you get a free bottle of sake (i have not cashed that in yet). \nThey used to have real scallops for their happy hour fried scallop dish, but last night when i was there, it was imitation scallops.....almost tasted like imitation crab meat, only rolled into a scallop shape.  Perhaps an oversight, perhaps a permanent change? Who knows....\n\nThe service is friendly, and really accommodating, and i will be back numerous times in the future"
"1","We ate here a month ago on a Saturday night with my daughter and had an great time at the sushi bar eating and talking to the chefs. Tonight (after the hostess took phone calls while people were waiting) she told us children can't sit at the sushi bar on the weekends, so we left. Honestly, it seemed like a lie so she could send us to a table. It's upsetting because the food is good. But after being treated the way we were I'll never go back - with or without my daughter."
"5","Best sushi in town. Sad it's such a small location because I'm impatient when it comes to waiting! The Green Valley is my personal favorite!"
"5","What can I say but awesome! A bit pricey but the best sushi in town. They have some of the freshest seafood of any sushi restaurant I've ever been to."
"2","Upon the chef's recommendation, a medium size sashimi plate was served.  However, it is unsatisfactory to my standard.  \nThe temperature of the sashimi was slightly warmer than it should be; I couldn't even breakdown the tendon part of the fish by chewing. (1/5)\n\nI didn't enjoy the dash of the kimchi sauce on one of the fish; it desensitized your taste bud to the fish.  \n\nWasabi was either those tube or the power mixed; I expected fresh wasabi with this price.  (2.5/5)\n\nThe miso soup ,which was water down too much for taste, was complimented with tofu cube and wakame (seaweed).  (2.5/5)\n\nAge tofu's (or fries tofu) sauce was too over-powering with sweetness; the flavor and aroma of fish flakes didn't arise to compliment the tofu.  (2/5)\n\nThe plate was chipped which should not been served for sanitation reason.  (-5/5)\n\nTemperature is the key to the sashimi and sushi not only for the reason of taste but sanitation as well. \n\nI may try hot dishes on the next visit to give a full judgement.   \n\nThe overall service was satisfactory. 4/5"
"5","My man and I go to Yummy grill about twice per week. Everyone I bring ends up becoming a regular. The fish is the freshest and best high quality selection in Vegas- bar none! Eric is the bomb. You WILL NOT be disappointed!!! My man came in eating california rolls and now he's a sashimi buff. Thank god for this place"
"1","I do not understand why this place has so many good reviews.  I usually give a place a second try if I have a first bad experience but the food was that bad that I will never return. \n\nI was here for dinner late night on a Friday.  It was refreshing to not see an AYCE sushi place. I had read reviews of how fresh the fish was. I had high hopes that this place was good since it's not too far from home.  \n\nDinner consisted of mainly nigiri and a few rolls. The sushi rice was horrific. Very mushy and unappetizing.  The nigiri was very inconsistent with the amounts of wasabi. The fish I had did not seem fresh at all. I would definitely not be recommending this place to anyone."
"4","Amazing tasting sushi. Fresh. Artistic food. Friendly service. Very busy place but worth the waiting (10-20 minutes) for rolls. \nThe reason I did not give 5 stars: The communication between the server and chefs. Orders were being missed on tickets due to the high volume of orders. The server and chefs were aware and were constantly checking in on each other to make sure orders were executed appropriately."
"2","I am curious. Is Quest Diagnostics such an evil company that it brings out the worst in its employees???? \n\nIf you do not like to deal with people, look for another job!!!!! \n\nQuest employees are just downright mean and condescending.\n\nI dislike this evil corporation."
"1","Dr Sikand sent me to have a lump diagnosed for cancer but they ordered the wrong test. They told me I had to have another test but they weren't sure if my insurance will pay for it. 2 weeks later they still don't know. Their lack of communication and failure to order testing correctly is unacceptable. I cannot recommend this doctor to anyone."
"2","Although the ambiance, wine store and service is superb, I find this to be one of the most overrated restaurants in Las Vegas. To describe the food as lack luster is actually kind. The onion soup I had was bland and the lobster croissant sandwich was an affront to good seafood. I specifically asked about the quality of the lobster meat and was assured that is was \""wonderful\"". When the sandwich arrived it had the shredded consistency of canned lobster and the bread was a cheap croissant that was way too buttery (not even close to the pastry pictured in the photos from the restaurant). It was the first time I can remember actually being angry at my lunch.\nThe wine shop , however, is excellent and they only charge $10 for a corkage fee. Although,  I can't understand why they don't have a wine list. You are forced walk around the shop to find what you want, which is usually a wonderful, but occasionally I find that it would be nice to have a list to guide you."
"3","I like Marche Bacchus a lot. But I definitely go there for the food, the wine and the view, not the service. \n\nWe've been there numerous times and each time it seems the service gets a little worse. Our first server there was great, friendly, fast, and always smiling! I found the  food on that visit was simply mediocre, though my fiance really enjoyed it, so we went back again. \n\nFrom that point onward, the food got better as the service just got worse. Our most recent time, our waiter completely forgot to give us water and it took over half an hour just to get our meals! This was at lunchtime, and both of us had ordered simple soup and sandwich combos, in a mostly empty patio, so I really don't think it's excusable. The sandwiches were great, though I thought the chilled soup much too sweet: almost like a melted ice cream.\n\nAnyway, I definitely recommend this place to anyone that isn't in a rush and has an hour and a half to two hours to spend in a picturesque setting with delicious french food. \n\nThe bread pudding is to DIE for!"
"1","Worst $100 lunch i ever spent. I was excited to try this place, my husband is french and a chef, so we had high hopes. First off the wine they served us was off, seems like it had been opened for a month. Next our server was horrible. He made us feel like he didn't want to serve us, and he was not that smart. He forgot to give us things we asked for. We ordered 3 course, when the food came, it was very mediocre. \nCountry pate that was old, tart that was falling apart, and my scallops did not have a starch, and done in 2 bites.  Now i am willing to pay money for good food, but this was ridiculous. We will never go back. Save your money, no view of a man made lake is that worth it."
"1","I took my family for mothers day to this restaurant and what a disappoint. They got greedy, they were under staffed, overbooked and under prepared. \nIt was uncomfortably hot! The fans were broken, the misters were not available yet. On top of that the servers were so busy they couldn't refill our water glasses. It's Vegas, it's May, at 600 dollars for our table you really should be prepared. \nOur table we reserved was 30 minutes late to be seated. It would be a hour before we would eat our first plate. Which seemed mass produced standardized at best. \nThe cherry on top was when the hostess entered the bathroom and ejaculated an expletive upon finding both bathroom stalls were occupied. While this would not normally bother me in the slightest. What she did not know was that I was waiting for my 5 year old niece in the stall. The behavior of their entire staff was manic and panicked. I am sorry to write such a poor review for a place I so dearly loved. But then again Marche Bacchus let me down too."
"2","Decided to take the family out to a nice brunch, so we decided to go here. We heard good reviews so we decided to give it a try. The breakdown: Lakeview was great. The service was lagging. Constantly had to remind our server to refill waters. (Even when his section was empty). Appetizers took 30min for salmon tartare and French onion soup. By the time we got our main course we were full on bread and patience. First time here = bad experience. Food overall was ok. There's no definite wow factor."
"5","I was shocked to find out I have not reviewed Marche Bacchus prior.  I have been a regular here for years and guess I have always forgotten to submit a review. Having said that, it is well over due and deserving of my reserved 5 Star rating.  The service, scenery and setting is deserving of 4 stars alone, but the food pushes it on to 5 stars.\n\nMy most recent visit was just for a quick lunch, but we enjoyed ourselves so much we ended up spending a few hours just enjoying the scenery and ambiance.  The staff is very friendly and efficient without being over bearing and ever present.  I haven't tried everything on the menu as of yet, but everything I have tried has more than satisfied.\nIf you are looking for a quiet place for lunch, or a romantic setting for dinner you can't miss with Marche Bacchus."
"1","I wish I could comment about the food but my friends and I never got to our table. On our way in, Tracy, the host, made us wait while she finished her phone call. When she was done with her phone call, we thought we were finally going to get our table. Instead, she started stuffing menus in a menu holder and then took another phone call. While she was doing that, my friends and I browsed through their wine selection to pass the time.  At some point, one of my friends asked her if they're open. After a 15-minute wait and almost as an afterthought, Tracy picked up 4 sets of menu and led us to our table. At this point, we already decided not to eat there. We declined and told her why. She was so indignant about being told that she was being discriminating. Worst customer service ever!"
"5","This is truly a shining star in Las Vegas.  Off the beaten path, this restaurant will offer its diners a superb culinary experience.  The wine choices are extensive and ridiculously reasonable, even the high end wines.  The menu offers traditional, as well as, modern conceptions with French-flair; all of which are brilliantly executed.   There is limited seating, both inside and out, so be sure to make a reservation through yelp.  We will definitely be back to dine again."
"5","Such a great place for date night!  Being from the midwest and always around lakes and rivers, this place was a great find in the middle of the desert.  Such a romantic, relaxing setting lakeside.  Great wine selection and good food.  My fiance and I go there quite a bit.  Only one time did my steak not turn out the best.  Other than that, service is great and food/wine is excellent."
"4","Let me first start out with my gripe and get it off my chest so I can move on with my life (just kidding, kinda). So I made reservations about 6 weeks prior to Bastille Day, for brunch, we had a group of 10, so I wanted to make sure I gave plenty of notice (I'm a planner). I arrive the day of, led out to the patio area, and the hostess says, I'm so sorry, I thought we had the table ready. So I'm led to another area of the patio and seated. It's July 11, and when I made the reservation, I wasn't anticipating sitting outside, so I didn't bother requesting inside. I see there are quite a few people outside, and they had fans going, so I decided to toughen up and enjoy it (I love outside dining, just not when it's 108 degrees out). As we are sitting there, the misters would shoot on for 2 seconds and shut off, I asked our waitress if there was any way they could leave them on, she said they \""were working on it\"". As the table is sitting there, all of us are dressed up, we are all dripping with sweat and having a hard time enjoying ourselves. As we are leaving, the hostess apologizes for the heat and asked us \""did your waitress tell you what happened\"" we said no, she said a customer had decided to try and redirect one of the misters directly on him and it broke the entire system, the hostess then followed it up with \""your waitress should've offered to move you girls inside\"". Little late now. Also, I had a restaurant.com voucher that I attempted to use, if anyone is familiar with those, they are very specific on the voucher about day, times, etc about when you can use them. My voucher only stated not valid on alcohol. So, they would not accept my voucher because they said their system is only set up to accept the vouchers for dinner (does not state this anywhere) the mgr claimed he has been meaning to contact them to correct it. That's my rant. \n\nThe food. Our brunch was amazing. Every single dish. A few stand outs were, French Toast, Lobster Salad Croissant and of course the Croque Madame. The Creme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e was delicious, I attempted to get the bread pudding, but they were out of vanilla ice cream, and the waitress tried talking me into subbing mango ice cream instead, which sounded terrible together. \n\nI enjoyed my food enough to overlook the service issues we had and to come back and dine again."
"5","We just had a wonderful experience at this lakeside french restaurant! Chris our server is outstanding and the food was amazing too! Highly recommend this great place for brunch!"
"4","I love their bagels. Don't like their coffees because Starbucks is better but they have really good bagels and smoothies."
"1","Back in January I had to have my gall bladder removed which was a very unexpected and scary surgery for someone like me who has only ever had my wisdom teeth out. I was referred to Dr. Teng's office by a friend of mine who had the weight loss surgery that is his bread and butter. I should have waited for the doctor who I was referred to in the ER to have an opening but I was in a ton of pain and wanted to have the surgery as soon as possible. It was no surprise that my liver was inflamed and that Dr. Teng said it was the worst gall bladder case he has ever seen, but at least he got it out and although I now have an 8 inch scar it was worth it to no longer be in the kind of pain I was experiencing.\n\nI too had to pay a deposit before the surgery which I did and then six months after the surgery I received a sizable bill. I couldn't understand why after the deposit and my insurance company pitching in he was still expecting me to pay almost $800! With the ER bills leading up to the surgery taxing our finances as well you can imagine I was not thrilled. My husband tried calling the office at least three times to get the scoop on the bill. When it came in the mail it looked sketchy with no actual descriptive information on it. I could have designed a more legitimate looking invoice on my own computer! We wanted to know what we were paying for exactly and why the balance was so much. After three phone calls my husband had still not heard back from the office yet they continued to send out invoices threatening to slap us with a late payment. Honestly, who does not return phone calls?!?!? If you are a business it is what you do! We were very frustrated.\n\nFinally my husband got ahold of Dr. Teng's head secretary or office manager who seems to think very highly of herself. She was very unhelpful and wouldn't answer his questions besides telling him to contact our insurance provider. Again, what kind of business practice is this?\n\nWe paid our bills and hopefully that's the end of it."
"1","It's a quick meal for lunch, but fairly unappetizing. I am quite unsure why there was such a long line leading to the entrance. It's place I am definitely not look forward to visiting again."
"1","This food was horrendous. I'm not even joking and not that you thought I was. Please save your time and do not stop here. Gummy noodles and raw veggies...ugh\nI even asked for veggies well done. They better shape up or they won't  be open much longer. Just my thoughts."
"1","This place is a rip-off.  Park Avenue Cleaners are one of the most expensive around with an awful customer service. I was quoted one priced and was tripled when I picked up my clothes.  The lady working there had the nerve to insist repeatedly  that I heard wrong, as if I couldn't understand English or was senile.  On top of this they left soap stains on one of my dresses.  I'm never going back to this place and suggest you look around for other cleaners with a better price, they are many around this neighborhood.   If you go with them, make sure to get the price on writing before you leave your clothes with them."
"4","My favorite pizza. There is something unique about the spicy sauce that's awesome. The crispy crust is nice as well. The downside is it is more pricey vs other chain's significantly and sometimes you wait on hold a long time when placing your order. I would eat this once a week if it weren't for the price/affordability vs Pizza Hut or Dominos as my kids could care less about the quality difference."
"5","Love this place. Since Shakey's no longer exists in Vegas, this has become the next best thing. The crust is perfect ( I like it thin) the sauce is perfect, and the pie's always come out with those air bubbles in the crust .....love it!\n\nSalad bar kicks ass too. Pizza and salad...the perfect combo if you ask me"
"5","My daughter got her nails done, they are awesome, the 3- D design is just out of this world. Vicky took her time, the shop has full range of glitter and designs. Went there last month for a mani/Pedi... Love love, for my engagement- that didnt last but the mani/pedi did."
"1","I wish I would have read the other reviews before going in.  I may have chosen to go somewhere else.  Clearly, good customer services is NOT a priority.  The food was okay but a bit overpriced, the beers were cold but the service was slow.  $25 of play at full tilt didn't warrant a single comp.  When I asked the bartender how much you had to play to receive a comp, she said $30. Since that is higher than ANY other place place I have been to in town, it might have been good information to give me.   I know that $25 is not a lot of play but I was never inticed to play more.  The bartender never asked if I was/wanted to be a member of the players club and never told us about any promos etc.   Also, it took about 10 minutes to get our change because the bartender was more concerned with the payout to the GM who was drinking at the bar.  It is unfortunate because this place has a lot of potential and is close to my home but I won't be back.  I am not sure how they stay in business since there were a total of 10 people at the bar from 9-11 PM on a Friday night and it is clear that they are not welcoming new customers."
"1","I have never been so a Sonic so bad :(\n\nIt takes a lot for me to give a place 1 star but this one deserves it.\n\nI Pulled up to order and had to wait 15 minutes before someone took my order. Why 15 minutes?!?! I was thinking to myself after the experience why I even waited that long.\n\nThe service was terrible and the food was so greasy. The grease was oozing from the tater tots and the cheese wasn't even melted on my dog which makes me wonder what kind of cheese it is to begin with. I asked for regular coke and got diet. I never had a problem at any of the other Sonic locations so I am not sure what it up with this one but I will never be back. \n\nI wish I had something positive to say but I just don't."
"4","I have been here a few times. I think this place is definitely better than the other common Mexican family chain taco places. I had the shrimp burrito. At first I was kinda iffy ordering shrimp. In the end it was worth the risk. It was the perfect amount of spiciness where it makes you sweat a little but you cant stop eating it. My friends dad got the mole chicken and he swears it was just as good as his ex wife's. I know of several other people that live in the area that also rave about this place. They have dinning tables but its more of a order your food to go place. They cook the food fresh so it will still be piping hot when you get home."
"3","We came here because we had a Restaurant.com certificate to use. It was ok, but nothing special. The taco shells were fresh and made onsite and the chicken was delicious. The rice, however, was mushy. And they used preshredded cheddar cheese. Not very authentic but a nice cheap meal."
"4","A bit small inside. Bathrooms are clean and food is always great. The boy at the register is nice. There are Roberto's all over town but I prefer this one because of the cleanliness and food consistency."
"1","Expecting a professional establishment? Expecting good customer service? Expecting to be greeted as you come in the door? Expecting to be helped in a decent time frame? Well, don't go here, ever. I've been to this place twice and both times were a bad experience. When you walk in the door, you're not sure where to go because the place is so sloppily put together. So naturally you stand, and you wait, expecting for someone to come and help you. Not the case here. The employees sit and have casual conversations while they should be helping customers. \nI stood and waited for almost 30 minutes both times.. The first time I was coming to buy cleaning solution, the second time, I was coming to get a piercing tightened. Its not like I was going to get some huge tattoo or something, my visits shouldn't have lasted for more that 10 minutes each, yet I was forced to wait and wait, to the point that on my second visit I gave them a piece of my mind and went elsewhere. \nAnd they have this disgusting leather couch that they have people sit on while waiting for their service, I'd suggest you not use it, you'll probably get AIDs."
"1","The only thing I like about this casino is the Sobe Ice Rink thats attached to it. \n\nIf you live in east vegas, it sucks because you have to drive quite a distance to get to it. the other ice rink in henderson sucks, its too small\n\nThe sister casino, Fiesta Henderson? ha no comment."
"1","This was the worst experience I have ever had not only with a place to stay, but the customer service as a guest here.\n\nDo. Not. Come. Here. For. Any. Reason. Under. The. Sun.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause my boyfriend and I were UNLAWFULLY kicked out and they voided their OWN contract and fine-print that they made us sign/initial!\n\nMy boyfriend basically told me Monday morning  (7/22/13) he was going to go to the front office to renew his wifi. When he got there, he spoke to the two same teenage girls that helped us get set-up in the place the previous week.  Come to find out, because of the billing and credit card situation being odd, because of our property manager paying for everything, he wasn't able to renew the wifi for another week at $5 because they were going to have to have the property manager call the front desk to allow them to charge the same credit card.  It was a pain because it is really hard to get a hold of anyone with property management and come to find out, we were staying there for two weeks and they only paid for one!  My boyfriend in pure frustration after hearing this, grabs his phone in anticipation of calling our property manager and mutters to himself \""son of a bitch.\""  That was a statement made TO HIMSELF.  One of the young girls jumped on that, stating, \""Excuse me?\"" My boyfriend immediately came back with, \""..What?\"" because he didn't know what she was talking about. \n\nRather than being a stand-up, normal person, she immediately took offense and asked him rudely, \""Did you just call me a stupid bitch?\"" From what my boyfriend told me, he immediately said no, stating he was frustrated at the fact that he had to \""call these people again\"" and apologized for making it seem like he was directly insulting her. Rather than taking the apology, she calls her manager over, acting angry stating my boyfriend called her a stupid bitch.\n\nThis is where it all gets very messed up.\n\nThis manager decides to go off on my boyfriend totally out of the blue, and I quote from him, \""She walks over and starts asking me 'Who do you think you are fucking insulting my employee'\"", he tells me that again he repeats himself stating it wasn't meant to be an insult and he was cussing to himself. He tried telling her he wasn't threatening her employee and he apologized for the language and she stated \""to not use that god damn language in her office\"". He told her that we hadn't been paying for our room for the past week BECAUSE of the management company, to this she responds, \""You don't have to worry about the rent, you need to pack up your shit and go.\"" When he protested, considering that was like an 18-wheeler randomly hitting someone, she pulled out her cellphone and threatened my boyfriend saying she was going to call Metro (the police) on him if he didn't leave immediately. He comes back to our room stating the situation. I, immediately, know it is a miscommunication because I KNOW for a fact my boyfriend does NOT treat anyone so disrespectfully. When I go to speak to this manager face to face, I am treated like shit on her shoe with her telling me I have thirty minutes to pack my \""shit\"" and get out. So, we do. Mind you, my property manager also tried to speak to her via the phone, to no avail! Apparently she's highly offended by cursing in her office - enough to evict someone in half an hour!\n\nWe were inside our room with our stuff finally packed to go (waiting for a taxi) when a person with courtesy patrol knocks on the door and tells us that we have to vacate the room because he's locking it up. That to me seemed normal, regardless of the terrible circumstances.  To make it WORSE, after he leaves and we're sitting on the steps with three overly stuffed garbage bags of groceries and stuffed to the brim suitcases, he comes back stating - and I QUOTE - \""You must have pissed someone off, because 'they' want you off of the property.\"" My boyfriend and I were SPEECHLESS! We were THROWN TO THE CURB!\n\nWe found out later the manager's name is Dana and that this is NOT the first time she has treated people this way. In a few examples (per tripadvisor), people were given a written eviction notice for no reason at all. One person stating, \""--New Manager Dana Alexander comes in and makes her own rules. Totally not in the rules and regulations. I thought maybe the corporation might wanna know how bad shes treating the costumers there so I wrote a letter. 3 days after, she brings a 7 day eviction letter.\"" After all of this, we called her district and regional managers and NO ONE even cares! Their excuse was that \""they operate as a hotel for the first 30 days\"" so that, by NV standards, excuses them and makes what she did legal. \n\nIf Dana and those girls read this one day, you are all low down and DO NOT deserve your job! Anyone and everyone headed to this place, RUN FOR THE HILLS! We did NOT deserve to be treated like animals and we did not deserve to be at the mercy of a person that is such a control freak that abuses her power."
"2","So I had no choice but to bring my baby back here cause they close pretty late at 10pm. In the day I'm busy =( so I'm only have free time is at night. \n\nSo my 2nd trip here is much more nicer than my 1st. They explain all the prices and asked me which one I wanted so there was no surprise at the bill at the end. But the wait is still long. Waited about 2hrs and something for everything to be done. \n\nSeems like there is new doctors and staff. Doc never talks about prices or bills only the aid/nurses does. Call for an appt they said they take walk ins. So I just went and gave my infor and about 4 mins I'm in the little private room waiting for the doc. \n\nDoc look all around and suggested some test to figure out whats going on. Then aid comes to give me a price list and pick one then Doc comes back to confirm that's what she's going to test. 1st test came back neg so Doc suggested another test. Aid came back telling me the prices etc then same thing. Doc came back said the 2nd test results takes a few days up to a week. Doc recommend some specialist if they can't figure it out after the results are in etc.\n\nGave me some RX I told her that their prices are to high and that I'm going else where to get them. Doc was nice enough to write out the RX for me. She also called the next day to tell me what's going on and wanted more infor about whats my baby been eating and snacking on etc. To rule out allergy."
"5","Great place with even better staff. They're very helpful, patient and caring. There have never been any surprise bills and they're very gentle with the animals. I only see Dr. Whitcraft because she is so personable, kind and terrific at her job. I highly recommend this place, especially compared to other vets I've been to throughout the years."
"1","This place is a total rip off they have vet come in and then have people come in after diagnosis with huge estimates for treatments unbelievable prices ... Went right after to another animal hospital and was given a price from the vet themselves and no huge outrageous estimate... My puppy was dying and all they could see was $ signs... Needless to say my puppy survived parvo but with no help from craig road animal hospital  and all the help in the world from another pet hospital not far from this used car dealership of a vet office ..."
"5","I was reading some of the not so great comments, and I truly believe that it's all in the vets you see. \nJessica Hagstette is amaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaazing!! I see her whenever possible and even when I see her outside of the clinic she always remembers my fur babies and to stop and ask how they're doing. \nUnfortunetly, when my little girl passed, I had to see someone different who was on call. Dr. Khamsi was nothing short of amazing. The procedure was going to cost $$$$ - and when I asked in her professional opinion if it would make a difference, she stated that she didnt think our girl would make it through the night and to not go through such a pricey procedure. She cried as she helped our little girl pass painlessly. \nSome vets truly do care about your animals and not the money. I would recommend CRAH over and over again."
"5","A city runs through it.\n\nLas Vegas grew around this place, originally a game dressing shop.  Chuck Frommer has expanded it into the best butcher shop I know of."
"1","I'm all about supporting small local businesses but I was lied to by John Mull employees about something I consider important.\n\nI called once and asked if they carried grass fed, pasture raised beef. The woman who answered the phone said yes so I went down and purchased two steaks. I verified one more time before purchasing that the beef was grass fed and again I was told yes. The steaks tasted great, but grass fed beef has a particular taste.\n\nFeeling skeptical, I called again today to see if they had any more in stock and to get the name of their supplier. The woman who answered the phone consulted with someone else and told me they don't carry grass fed beef, nor have they ever."
"4","Definitely one of the better BBQ spots in Vegas which isn't saying much because Vegas does not have much of a BBQ scene.\n\nAs you drive down Thorn Blvd, you'll think you made a wrong turn but as your turn into the place you'll find a small ranch which provides a great atmosphere to your bbq eating experience.\n\nYou place your order and then walk to the BBQ station where they fill your orders...very cool.   I like the small bench setups....feels very Rudy's like (if you're from Texas)   \n\nThe portions are very hearty.   I shared a 3 meat combo which consisted of 2 orders of ribs, pulled pork, mac n cheese, and green beans.   The pulled pork was pretty dissapointing - very sweet and tasted like rou song (taiwanese dried pork that you put on top of rice).   The star of the show is definitely the ribs.   Excellent flavor and very tasty with the spicy bbq sauce.   The texture was perfect and had the perfect bite....not tough and over cooked.   I prefer a little more char smokiness but overall taste and flavor was delish.\n\nI hope to come back to try their Trip Tip, brisket, and bbq chicken.  The mac n cheese was really good.  Green beans pretty soggy but good flavor.  \n\nIt's a very neat place and if i would definitely make the trek up for their ribs.  Be sure to check out the meat market next door to get some electic meats!"
"5","Don't get scared of the line! It's so worth it! The hot links are fantastic, and the green beans are done so well even a veggie hater will eat them."
"5","You will NOT leave this place hungry!  I'm a Food Network fan, so I had to check this place out when I saw it featured one evening on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives.  Don't let the location frighten you, as your GPS will guide you into a combination residential/commercial/farming/ranching part of Las Vegas not far from the strip.  My wife and I, along with our two teenagers were blown away by the quantity AND quality of the food!  Everything is homemade here.  The mac n' cheese is unbelievably delicious! Not-to-mention the brisket, ribs, chicken, pulled pork, green beans, baked beans, macaroni salad...and cobbler for dessert.  They make their own BBQ sauce used for dipping (both regular and hot).  We tried it all, and will definitely be back!  The eating area is all outside on picnic tables.  The owner made his way around the tables to greet everyone.  We went during a week night (he mentioned Fridays and Saturdays are the most crowded).  This place is an outstanding value for BBQ.  It will definitely be our first eating stop when we return to Vegas!"
"5","Off the charts.  Delicious.  How can a boiled rib taste so good!   Huge portions.  Really nice staff.  Thoroughly impressed.   A must eat local."
"4","Saw this on diners drive in and dives and the very next day I was standing in line in 100 degree heat to try some BBQ. \n\nBe prepared to sweat a bit even though they offer free lemonade while you wait! The \""restaurant\"" is more like an outdoor BBQ. You order and pay and they pull your order from the grill and call your name.  It's pretty simple really. \n\nYou can buy Tshirts if you wish, Or order cuts of meat from inside. It's a small room and kind of dungeon like but a lot of people were ordering so it must be good as well. The butcher is right there for you to watch. \n\nWe shared a 3 meat combo...ribs which were super tender, brisket that melted in my mouth with flavor and the hot link. Man oh man the hot link...I loved it. Perfectly cooked with a kick that keeps you wanting more. \n\nWe had Mac n cheese and potato salad for sides. Both were fresh and very good. The Mac was so cheesy! \n\nIt's located in a neighborhood and it's close to is so we will be returning when we get that BBQ craving. It's a must if you are visiting!!!"
"5","My 400th review.   So, this is a special one.   And, since lots of other people have already review John Mull's Meats, I'll make it short.   \n\nI thought the address was wrong because the place really is located amongst houses.   But it's a nice place.   There is plenty of parking in a private lot.   We found our way in to the grill.   It's just a simple block house building with the butcher side and the the grill side in it.   We studied the menu for a bit because it was our first time there.   The gals working the counter could not have been more patient and friendly with us.  We selected the three meat special for us to split.   We had ribs, brisket and the hot link with beans and mac and cheese for sides.   The food... well, wow!  It was great.   Everything was cooked well.  The hot link was not over powering but had a nice amount of warmth.  It was all so tasty.   We sat outside in the shade by a cooling mister.   That was pretty nice.   Thanks DDD!\n\nWill I be back?  Heck yeah.   The food is delicious."
"5","Had tri-tip and ribs with macaroni salad and yams. Meat was super tender and flavorful, best barbeque I've ever had. Sides were great, too."
"2","Arrived at 2pm on a Saturday- a busy time no doubt but we'd been here before and enjoy the food. We were told they were out of brisket. After waiting in line about 35 minutes we placed our order- 5 two-meat combos- all pulled chicken and tri-tip. Once we got to the counter for them to fill our order they then told us they were out of tri-tip and that it'd be a few minutes for the next batch to be done. They put our ticket aside as we waited. Tri-tip was done- but then they proceeded to fill singleton orders that came in behind ours, forgetting about our order. So now- no more tri-tip... again. Then they said brisket would be ready in a few minutes- we waited. After another LONG 45 minute wait, we were once again told that they were now out of brisket. Are you SERIOUS? I sighed and the man (\""Slick\"" they call him) behind the counter could sense my frustration. He began to try to make light of the situation saying things like \""aww don't get mad Erin.\"" (Your name is on your ticket order) And proceeds to turn to the others behind the counter saying, \""we done made Erin mad.\"" I don't know about you- but after an HOUR AND TWENTY MINUTE WAIT- you're right. I'm mad. And chastising your PAYING customers for your mistakes isn't the way to earn my business or my money. We asked for our $87 dollar refund and got the hell out of there. We won't be back."
"4","I write this quick review as I sit in the parking lot trying to not tear open my container, because it smells so good!\n\nFood is fresh so fresh you might have to wait for certain meats but, its definitely worth the wait \n\nI came at a good time so I avoided \""the line\"" which came shortly after I placed my order..the inside can get a little cramped but orders move out pretty fast. \n\nI'm sure I'll be back just judging off the smell I ordered the 2 meat combo tip/brisket mnc &baked beans \n\nI had to have a quick taste of a rib tip ...I can no  longer say Vegas doesn't have a good place for Bbq \n\nPerfect flavor and tenderness"
"5","I love this place.. They're sides are the bomb I always get the brisket dinner w/mac n cheese & baked beans.."
"3","The food was very good, old school the garlic toast and homemade thousand island dressing were very nostalgic.  The 2x baked potato was huge and the steak was excellent, but the bathrooms!  Please do something about them, it hurt the experience of an otherwise nice Friday night!"
"1","Oh No!!!! \nTo begin with twist cap wine-really??\nThere's more produce in the outside window than in the iceberg salad and for my heart attack stuffed potato if it were stuffed it wouldn't have killed a guppy. If you like good beef salud the beef is good the lobster not so much.\nWould not go here again......bye bye bob\nFor that price go to charcoal room"
"5","I have wanted to try this place forever. So this afternoon my daughter & I treated ourselves to the best lunch we have ever had. We shared, there was lots of food & we ate every bite! You could smell the mesquite on the burger and it was awesome. The entire family will go for dinner Christmas Eve!"
"4","This may have been my best meal in Vegas! Recommended by a local ... we traipsed out to the middle of no where aka NORTH las Vegas to a dirt parking lot and a lit walkway.\n\nBrought us to the Ranch - which was chock full of OLD SCHOOL movie star western cool. Rumor has it gangsters would meet way out here to eat to avoid the cops in Las Vegas proper.\n\nPlain jane interior but you walk by a MAJOR wood burning grill on your way in.  \n\nThe rib eye was amazing & perfectly cooked with a smokey under note.  I also had the calamari served with a spicy remoulade sauce and had my steak with an excellent blue cheese salad & steamed mixed veg.\n\nNo room for dessert but marking this one down for another visit."
"2","Used to be a favorite place to eat for my wife and I until we found a metal screw in my wifes Huevos Rancheros. Dissapointing. I had eaten there for over 20 years. Still a great place to have a beer but I'll never eat there again."
"1","Worst food I've tasted since 1995. Service was terrible and the filet mignon was cardboard. Very disappointed. Will never return"
"2","It is so unfortunate, but since the menu change, it has really went down hill. This used to be one of my favorite places to go for a good burger, or salad, etc...  But the changes are NOT positive ones.\nThe salads used to be almost works of art, now they look like pre-made wilted piles of mush.  \nI thought it was bad that they closed the Big Dogs on Sahara, but maybe not???\n\nSo, so disappointing!!!!"
"1","After being seated by a young host who mumbled something about drinks then walked off to never come back then sitting for over 10 minutes and being ignored by no less than 7 different servers who walked by us, we walked out. Since we've been here twice before and the food is always just average (extremely boring menu) don't think we'll be back. What a shame since there are not too many breweries on this side of town."
"3","Stopped here with a few others, as we met a \""local: here. Hung-out for a while, ordered some appetizers, and drinks. \n\nFOOD/DRINKS:\n     Ordered a beer that was on their menu, and written on their chalkboard - they didn't have anymore of that kind. Ordered another beer, that they had a photo/sign of in their bar, but they didn't carry that one. So I ordered a sampler of what beers, they did have, and that they brewed. Beer was good.\n\n     Ordered buffalo wings, buffalo chicken strips, and Nachos. The food came out in decent time, the buffalo wings were actually better than expected but the onion rings were on the \""soggy\"" side. The chicken strips were a bit under-par, and the nachos were actually good in size and good in quality. \n\nSERVICE:\n     Eehhhh, got me here. Did not get greeted, and it took quite some time for us to actually have a waiter walk up to us, after we even tried flagging one or two down. After that, they did serve us well though. \n\nFACILITY:\n    Parking is great but the place inside is a bit on the older, darker side. The bar had a \""Northwoods Inn\"" feel which could be good in ways, but bad in others. Table was clean, and bathrooms were well kept."
"4","I had a blast here Friday night! \n\nIt was a girls' night out. We danced a lot, drinks were cheap. The bartender was creative; I asked for a mixed drink, but for him to be more creative than a fuzzy navel or such. I told him I'm in the mood for coconut, so he got creative. I ended up with something fruity, coconut, and some kind of watermelon something. It was good! And he didn't cheat me on the alcohol, either! \n\nThe place wasn't too crowded either, just the right amount of people. My friend and I even pole-danced! :D\n\nThe only thing I really didn't like much was the DJ. He took requests and played those, that's cool. But he switched back and forth between music styles every other song and didn't mesh the songs very well either. He played many good songs, just didn't \""organize\"" them very well. At the end of the night (4ish am?), he repeated a couple songs from earlier in the night."
"5","Totally love this place..have been going here for YEARS...they have wood next door you can buy in the cord and a vet who comes in 2 times a month for low cost vet clinic!! SUPER saver!!!"
"3","Family friendly activities!\n\nIt was a flashback to my childhood skate parties.  The kids had a blast and the staff was pretty good at keeping track of the floor so the little ones didn't get run over."
"2","I have been to this theater many times before, but I must say on my last visit there I was less than impressed. Not that I was over the moon on my previous visits. \n\nI was there with my family on a Monday night for an 8:20 showing of Monsters University. We got our tickets and went through the concession walk through/ self serve, which I honestly think is just silly, why can't they just have the regular concession counter like at the other theaters? The reason I don't like the self serve is because everything is always messy and sticky, which it was! People just let there kids who are too small to reach the soda fountain help themselves to whatever they want and they get soda everywhere! I don't mean to sound like a hard ass, but watch your kids people!!! So of course it doesn't get wiped up in a timely manner and thus everything in that walk thru is pretty gross! \n\nMy family enters the theater and you know the build up when you walk in and you wonder how many people are already in there and you wonder if you will get to pick any seat you want or if it will be full already and you will have to sit next to strangers........ you know what I am talking about. \nSo we walk down the corridor and round the corner, yay my kids get to pick whatever seats they want, blah blah blah..... I can't be excited for them because all I can see is garbage! Yes I said garbage! There was garbage, popcorn, candy boxes, soda cups, under all the seats! I had to turn around and make sure we didn't walk into a movie that was already playing! But in fact we were in the correct theater and that was in fact trash under all the seats! So apparently they don't actually sweep out the trash, instead they just sweep it under the seats?!?! I was freaking out, but I had to do my best to put my OCD away so I didn't ruin the night for my kids. My hubby didn't even have to look at me to know what was going on, he did his best to find the seats with the least trash. \nThen once the movie started we noticed there was a big scratch down the left side of the movie screen! Seriously, this was not going to be my night! \n\nThis was just a lesson learned for my husband and I. We prefer the Aliante movie theater but we chose to go to the Santa Fe because it was closer to our house, we chose poorly! We will make the drive next time!"
"4","Pros:  Self serve and wide variety of concessions.  Beautiful lobby.  \n\nCons:  No drink refills and the theaters themselves are not as nice as Aliante."
"4","Fast service.  Ordered extra crispy chicken.  The food was good as usual.  Will come back again."
"1","Last time I ordered to go, I got the chow mein noodles instead of fried rice. When I got home, I opened my box to find literally chow mein noodles. No sauce, no veggies, nothing on the noodles. They basically boiled the noodles in water then placed in the box. Okay.... so I went back today. Got the lunch special. The chicken with mixed vegetables was good, but only the vegetables. The chicken was soggy and slimy and just not good. The fried rice was fried rice with egg. No vegetables. The service is also really strange and awkward. Time to find a new restaurant."
"4","this is a fun place to go for a cosume if you are an entertainer or just for fun! They have some new and almost new quality clothing and you can get 30% off if you bring a donation the staff was cool sometime you can find some cool stuff antiques other random stuff."
"1","ANother update at the bottom as the crap thickens...\n\nThis is an update of my original post in response to a comment posted to my review from Terry.\n\nNever again...went in for a part and have them verify it was what I thought a discontinued part no one carried. They took it in and 30 mins later tech came out and told me he found my part....for 600 dollars. I paid my service fee and left slightly worried. Took it to my real trusted shop James West Automotive and turns out its not even the part I or Sun Valley said it was...and it was only 100 dollars. \n\nAll these reviews about great smog checks?? Really?  That doesnt make a shop...being correct and not a crook does.\n\nGo ahead and head there if you wish...sure they have Oceanside property in Colorado for you too\n\nHere is the update and response:\n\nTerry I know your shop had been around since I have been coming to it for decades and went to school with Dan.  You were also my trusted shop until this day and went to who could get me in quicker which was yours.\n\nThe date of service was 11-1-2011 Invoice Number 51589 time in9:25 time out 10:20. Your typed quote was 596 plus the 46 for the diagnostic. Go ahead and find out the tech that tried to charge me that much for a part that oreilly's and autozone carry for just over a hundred and don't try to tell me the rest was labor as I changed it myself in 20 mins.\n\nThank you for making your shop look worse.\n\n2nd Update.\n\n\nWell Terrry 1st off the part was not a cheap part it was from Cardone who has been around almost twice as long as your shop. 2nd the 85% failure rating you gave was a nice number you plucked out of the air..nice try. 3rd. the person running your desk was quite clear that the diagnosis fee was not going to be credited back if I had the work done there as it work already performed. 4th.  I have a solo brake bleeder kit that magnetically sticks to the frame so ya..it is that easy to bleed the brakes but the hour labor was not the issue, the BS markup on the part was. \n\nReply with all the lies/excuses  you wish, Yelp is for the people and everyone reading this can see the facts and your several attempts/failures at excusing the BS that occurred that day. \n\nTake care and I wish you only the best"
"1","Rude employees and disingenuous advertising.  They claim to be open 7 days a week from 7 AM to Midnight.  I had my car towed in last Saturday around 5:00 PM.  As I was leaving I asked when they would look at it and the front desk guy says they run a skeleton crew on the weekends and should get to it by Sunday morning.  I called back at 9:30 AM Sunday and spoke with the mechcanic Justin.  I asked if had looked at my car and he said no and that he may get to it that evening.  I said \""Justin the reason I brought my car to you was that your open on the weekends and I need my car back ASAP\"".  Justin's response \""listen I'll get to it when I get to it and if you can't wait then come and pick up your car\"", so I did.  I could of had my car towed to a dealer who was going to look at it Monday.    I came to Vegas for the weekend and had no plans on staying till Monday, so I thought these guys advertising they are open on the weekend could take care of my overheating car, but instead they are basically open to take your can in and work on it during the week when they have a full staff.  The salt in the wound was speaking with Justin the Mechanic he was a condescending little punk.  I was not belligerent nor rude to him I just asked him when he was going to look at my car.  \n\nObviously management has no clue or doesn't care because they either hire rejects or don't train their employees on customer service skills.  More importantly they advertise they are open on the weekend and don't staff accordingly.  AE"
"1","The customer service here was terrible, getting estimate is very hard. The guy who answered the phone on 9/10/12 around 4:45 pm actually hung up in my face because he couldn't another guy name Mike. Don't waste your time like I did. I read the other comments that were listed and wanted to try them for myself, unfortunately some of the comments are true regarding the customer service. I feel bad for the owner, because as a business owner myself it's very hard to find good employees and ultimately they are a reflection of the company as a whole."
"5","This review was posted in error and I don't know how to delete it so I am just changing the star rating to five but I have no experience with the shop"
"5","Love this church! It's where I got saved. It's amazing and it's motto is \""Come as you are\"" it's modern and fun. It keeps you engaged with its modern take with videos, skits, and pictures. If I still lived in Vegas I would be here every Sunday. Canyon Ridge will forever be in my heart."
"1","I haven't been to Fatburger in a while and this was my 1st time to visit this location.  I'm a fan of Fatburger, but not this location.  Here's why.\n\nFOOD - 4 Stars\nI was prepared to give this place a 4 Star rating.  I noticed a new menu since my last visit to a Fatburger and ordered a XXL with all of the toppings & added Bacon & Cheese.  For a side, I ordered the Skinny Fries.\n\nAfter a 15 minute wait, I received my food.  To my surprise, the Burger was HUGE!  I should have paid more attention to the menu because this monster was more than I expected.....I guess I should have ordered a XL.\n\nI attacked the Burger and the Fatburger taste that I grew up with was still there.  The sharp flavor from the Mustard Relish and the Onions generated an explosion on my taste buds.  The Bacon was a nice addition and the Cheese was gooey and made it just right.  The Skinny Fries were just ok.\n\nOverall, the meal was awesome.....now, this is where it went from 4 Stars to 1 Star.....I went to the restroom to wash up since the Burger was pretty messy.  When I got to the restroom I was appalled at how disgusting it was.  It was worse than a Gas Station Bathroom.  The kicker was when I saw that the paper towels to wipe your hands were on top of the toilet.....what's the point of washing your hands when you're about to wipe it on towels that are contaminated from the toilet?!!!  \n\nSee the pics I uploaded for details....you'll notice the brown paper towels sitting on top of the toilet tank and that the spot on the wall where the dispenser is suppose to be mounted has spots where plaster was used to cover up the holes...the hand towels are almost touching the toilet seat!!!  ....someone must have pulled it off the wall....but they're not going to replace it?  My issue with this is that is the same bathroom where the employees wash their hands.....gross.  To be fair, I've sent an email to their corporate office to make them aware of this situation....it can't be up to code...can it?  I hope not.\n\nWill I return?  Not until they fix the issue with the hand towels."
"3","Ok, for those of you adventurous enough to travel away from the touristy parts of Las Vegas... here is a place where the locals go.   \n\nWhere else can you find $5 pai gow poker and black jack?   It's small, it's older but you can gamble for a long time on the cheap here.   They have improved the air handling system, but when you leave you will still smell like smoke.   \n\nGo there and have some good cheap fun."
"2","- We requested a crib and it took 4 requests over 2 days to get one delivered to our room. \n- The path from the entry to the hotel elevators is full of smokers. Since this hotel does support non-smoking floors, it would be nice if this main entry area was clear of smoke. I didn't enjoy walking my baby through a cloud of smoke every day.\n- The pillows were really crummy and we had only one thin blanket on the bed.\n\nIn all, it was an inexpensive hotel that I wouldn't recommend for travelers with families."
"3","Stayed here a couple nights.   Only payed about $40 per night.. room was okay.   Smelled weed walking dow. The hallways..  but what do you expect only $40 a night lol.  Not the worst hotel I been in."
"2","The only thing this place has going for it is the food.  Good variety of food to choose from.  If you are looking for a steak house, it is one of the best I have ever had.  I have been to numerous high end steak houses all over and this is one of the best.\n\nThe rooms here are disgusting.  I had two different rooms during my stay.  The first room; the towel holder broke off of the wall, the shower head was separated from the tile, the lamp was broken and the carpets were all stained.  The second room also had dirty carpets and there was actually dry blood running down the side of the bathtub.  Absolutely disgusting.  Don't these people clean the rooms?  If I can see it, I don't see how someone that is supposed to be \""cleaning\"" the rooms can miss it.\n\nI would definitely come back to eat, but I would never stay at this place again.  They have a lot of work to clean this place up."
"3","To my mind, besides serving very good hamburgers, Wendy's Chili is so excellent and satisfyingly delicious that it is award worthy.  Allowed to simmer for hours, this mixture of nicely seasoned Kidney Beans, Pinto Beans, pieces of tomato, onion, celery, and lean beef drenched in a great kicky sauce is hard to beat.  So much so that I almost never leave a Wendy's without ordering Chili along with a burger and fries.  My square and rather flat quarter-pound burger topped with a single slice of American Cheese, and a fresh tomato slice, lettuce, pickles, and ketchup on a soft bun was quite tasty.  But, alas, the skin-on fries were sort of dead tasting, with no hint of salt.\n\n3-1/2 stars overall on my single visit here!"
"5","These guys are normally backlogged five days and understandably so. The record is impeccable and work is top notch. I was referred here by a few places including the last place to look at my work truck. I called and they said we do free test drives to see what could be wrong. I came in at 10 AM they drove my truck and immediately realized that \""U\"" joints were going bad. They quoted me $140 to replace both front and rear and balance the driveline which I thought was extremely fair! I told them I did not have a ride and he said he would get right on it for me. I walked down the street to kill some time at the motorcycle shop. I called for a ride and before I know it they were calling me from Dan's drive line letting me know they had already finished my truck. Talk about service! Dan you and your crew will always receive my business and any of my customers business as well, Thank you!"
"3","Remember when you were a kid and your folks dragged you to Kmart to go shopping for whatever.   This is exactly that store.   Well, ok, it's not THE store I used to go to, but it looked just like the way I remembered it.   \n\nWe were there last March, right before the NASCAR race and we needed supplies.   (Read that - a Styrofoam Ice Chest).   On our way over to Big Dog's Draft House we saw this Kmart.   Sure enough, they had the same beige tile floors and freaky weird check out lanes as the Kmart of my youth.   We found the cooler, got some snacks for the race and a few other things like contact lens solution and sun block.   Bonus points for getting us out of there for less than $20.  \n\nWill I be back?  Yeah probably, I will need a cooler again someday."
"2","Stopped in to get some items for the haunted garage. I was drawn in by the sign that read \""Halloween blowout sale.\""  It wasn't really a blowout sale, as most of the Halloween items were NOT on sale. I grabbed a few things that were on sale, but the sale price didn't ring up at the register. It didn't help that the store was busy, the clerk working the Halloween section didn't know what items were on sale and the check out lines were long."
"1","Came here because I just moved to the area and wanted to find a nail place near by. This is not the place! This place is very dirty and the staff was not friendly. They did a poor job on my pedicure, they did not get my feet as smooth as my normal place and the white tips were sloppy. The full set was even worse, crooked and the nails started lifting right away. It was so bad, I completely removed them within 4 days. What a waste of money. I will not come back here and I recommend anyone reading this steer clear of this facility."
"1","Just a quick side note:\nI went to the location on Harmon and Koval.\n\nHad there been a half-star rating, they would have gotten that. The only reason I'd give them that is because they were able to schedule my family member in so quickly. I received a call from someone at their place of business returning my call from a day before. I left my cell phone number on the voicemail, yet they called my workplace on the phone I had placed the original call from. They had gotten my cell phone number wrong and admitted so on the phone when I asked what number they had for me. No big deal, we moved on. She got my family member's information and insurance numbers and the usual information they get when they book an appointment. She said they accepted the insurance and we could come in the next day for an appointment. \nI arrived with my family member on the appointment day a few minutes after noon. The appointment was for 12:40, so we finished the paperwork that we had already begun at home the night before (the office faxed it to me). The office staff was given the ID and insurance cards, and they gave them back shortly after. They were nice, but from there on out, clearly didn't have their stuff together and it became apparent to me they were very noticeably incompetent. My family member has a unique insurance where, if someone has never dealt with the company before, they may run into a snag, at most. Let me preface this by saying, they have NEVER had an experience such as what happened at this place nor anything even close to it. The insurance-verifying person has never had a problem until this place.\n\nFrom the time we sat down a few minutes after noon until about 1:30, the office staff was STILL unable to verify the insurance. HUH!?!?!  I even made an effort to call and be on hold with the insurance company for 15 minutes to speak to someone, hand a member of the front office staff my cell phone, then still be told that they couldn't use the info that the girl was giving them from the insurance company. Even the insurance girl was confused as to why they weren't able to find out what they needed. The original appointment setter and person who handles their insurance issues \""works from home and doesn't come to the office.\"" So I couldn't even speak to anyone who normally dealt with these issues and whom I spoke to the day before. I could go on, but no one would want to even read about my full experience, yet experience it themselves. Needless to say, we never saw the doctor, and after almost an hour and a half, we left. My family member went there for debilitating pain, and sat in a chair the whole time with no regard as to how long they were having to wait for the run-around that we got. I will NEVER recommend this place. It's sad I can't even review the doctor himself since we never even got that far. If your front office staff can't get it together, maybe you should hire new ones. They lost a new patient and a good referral for the possibility of others.\n\nIf Dr. Lanzkowsky sees this, it would have been nice to meet you and see if you could help with my family member's pain."
"5","This particular Domino's Pizza is the location I use for delivery when I would like a pizza at home.  They are always prompt and very polite when they deliver, and the pizza is hot fresh and baked perfectly."
"1","If you want your feet to even be somewhat smooth, do not go here. Their $25 pedicure is merely a polish change and hot water soak."
"1","Do NOT go there for waxing services! I went there to get my legs waxed and had the most horrible experience ever. The woman who attended to me did not know how to wax - not even that skin needs to be held tight in order to really remove hair. She applied wax and very gently peeled off the strips so I was left with a lot of wax-covered hair. At the end she asked me to take a look and I found large sections where no hair had been removed. I had to walk her through it but she still couldn't pull off the strips in the right way. And did I mention that she burned me in a few places with this special microfiber wax she recommended? I had to go home and shave most of my legs which was painful because of all the burns... I couldn't wear jeans because they were too rough for my scarred skin and I couldn't go out wearing skirts or dresses. I paid close to $100 for a lot of pain. The salon should seriously consider changing its waxing practices before they get sued by someone."
"1","This place is going down the drain. Sad. Great food but service has went down the drain. Won't be back!!"
"5","Amazing jewelry store. We've bought and had fixed/serviced our watches, rings etc They are wonderful. Unfortunately Danielle, the lady who usually answers the phone, has poor phone manners. I won't give T Bird less stars though. She just needs to check her tone of voice!"
"5","I love this gym, the personnel there have the best attitudes, greeting you as you come in and leave. They have a small section where you can purchase protein bars,  multivitamins, and many more options. Not only that but they have a smoothie bar that is fairly priced. Have kids? No babysitter? They have a play room which is supervised that you can bring your kids to be watched while you get your work out on. There is any type of gym equipment  you could possibly think of, so it gives you so many options on what you want to work out on. They offer classes for yoga and zumba, spin class, a boot camp class, so many different ones. There is a basketball room and a swimming pool for you to swim laps. A hot tub and a sauna is just two more awesome features this gym has. I work with a personal trainer and I've never enjoyed it more. She trained me in some work outs and showed me exactly how to use a lot of the equipment there. It's honestly not very expensive to belong to this gym either. I would recommend this place to just about anyone!"
"2","This club is the least friendly in Las Vegas. I workout daily and visit six different 24hr clubs throughout the week. I have had a chance to visit all 13 clubs in Las Vegas. The staff at this location very rarely say hello to me. They never say goodbye to me when I leave. If I get a hello it is unenthusiastic and unprofessional. Class instructors range from excellent to adequate. Obviously this is my least favorite club. My favorite club is Centennial, surprisingly the friendliest club has to be S. Rainbow."
"5","Nice looking premises! Clean!\nI usually go to the 24 on Rainbow but I decided to give this one a shot. I like the dynamic atmosphere. People working out hard, minding their own business, doing their own thing. Smiles everywhere and CLEAN!  The clean part is a big deal since unfortunately the Rainbow location seems to be lacking in this area. \nI was pleased to see 2 Crossfit Tractor tires. It also has a Pilates room  (another plus). Even with the new years resolutionists, there is plenty of availability for superset workouts. The equipment is ok; I wish it had more leg equipment. A sissy squat machine would be great. It is also missing the revolving solid bent D- Lat pulldown bar with handles which I use a lot. But overall it's a nice gym. \nI recommend this place."
"1","One of the more cleaner 24. But this review is based on the people that go this 24. Gym filled with racist people who will stereotype you based on your race. If you are Asian, you are not welcomed at the basketball court."
"5","I've been going to Town Center Dental for 6 years now.  Dr. Devore is one of the best dentists I've had in Vegas.  When I first moved here in '93 I bounced around dentists because I couldn't find one.  I found one for a few years, but then he retired.\n\n6 yrs ago a colleague at work recommended Dr. Devore.  I tried him out and my family has been seeing him ever since.  He is a really nice guy who really cares about his patients.  I've recommended him to several people and they all love him.  A+++ in my book."
"5","I grew up in Las Vegas and moved out to California over six years ago. I still come back to Town Center Dental to see Dr. Devore and his staff when I need dental care. They are just THAT exceptional. Both Dean and Sonya are gental and kind hygienists.  The clinical staff including Dr. Devore will also take the time to answer my questions and they provide samples and goodie bags of their dental products to try. I have even received personal follow up calls to see how I was doing after visits. Great care and great service in one center!"
"4","This course is a great value for locals. It has a challenging layout and great views. It is located in somewhat of a condo canyon, but none of the holes feel cramped. I play it about once every two weeks and the pro shop staff is helpful and pleasant. It is not as unique as some of the high-end courses in Vegas, but for the good deals that you can get, I'm not gonna complain."
"4","This is my second review of this place and I really wish I could give Sultan's Grill 5 stars!\n\nThe only thing is the fact that at least 4 separate nights when I came to their restaurant and they were OUT OF LAMB and then today during lunch they were OUT OF SPINACH PIES!\n\nI came around 1pm today so luckily, they didn't run out of  the stuff to make Gyros, Fries and Cucumber Sauce.  I am a fan of those.  I could eat their gyros all day and night.\n\nQuick Tip: They have spinach pies on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays only.  I wish I could have the chance to try it out, though.\n\nAlso, it appears they are open Sundays per the signa posted today."
"1","The food was so so I would say...they do go heavy on the spices though...they took forever to being my food out...the taziki was really sour an the falafels were dry...only thing I really liked on the plate was the rice...the kids plate came with barely any fries an 2 pieces of chicken strips...not sure if this is a return place for me..."
"3","Sometimes, I crave gyro meat.  Sultan's grill is very close to my house and satisfies my cravings when it gnaws at me and I am too lazy to drive to the Kabob Korner downtown.\n\nSultan's Grill is average Greek fare.  Good, not great food that will hit the spot when you're hungry.  It really bugs me that they do not have pita, but a more tortilla sized, thin flatbread.  Their grape leaves are unfortunately very oily.  The price is very reasonable for their lunch combos which include a salad and choice of rice or french fries.\n\nSometimes I think the teenage girl that works there needs to put more clothes on, but that is just my humble, prudish opinion!"
"4","My best friend and I were starving so he yelped food to find something in the area that sounded good. This place caught his attention so we checked it out. I had the chicken shish kabob and grilled shrimp kabob which were both very delicious. Salad came with it and was very fresh. My best friend had the ground beef kabob along with chicken and the ground beef wasn't that tasty but it wasn't nasty. If ever back in that neighborhood I will definitely go back!"
"5","Very friendly staff. Great personal service. I needed a minivan. They offered a journey but the inside height was not tall enough for items I was transporting  They drove to another location to bring a minivan back. The went the extra mile to help me get what I needed."
"3","I'm a fan of Fabulous Freddy's, but think this one is just okay. Compared to the one I frequent, this one isn't as busy at all. My usual Fabulous Freddy's takes a little longer for a car clean and wash, but at least the job is perfecto.  \n\nSome Pros:\n-Close to one of my gyms.  I can get me car washed or detailed while I shed some pounds. \n-Close to Rachel's Kitchen.  I can get my eat on while they clean my car\n-Quick:  One of the quicker car washes I've been to. The Freddy's I usually go to takes a long time for your car to get cleaned.  I've even waited as much as 45 minutes for a regular detail.  Here you get your car back with the quickness. \n\nSome Cons:\n-The detail wasn't as good as the other Fabulous Freddy's.  Outside was fine, inside needed a little work.  I was in a rush on my most recent visit so I finished what they didn't when I got home.  \n-No real lobby.  There's outside seating to wait for your ride and a makeshift lobby between the coolers and chips.  Not much comfort inside in my opinion. \n\nI'm not saying I won't come back. I still think the job they do here is okay. But if I had a choice, I will continue to go to the Freddy's I usually hit right off Craig Rd."
"2","The service was good but the course not so good.  Wouldnt play here again."
"1","They can't get the orders right.  I always have to double check my bag before leaving the drive thru. They're open late, but they have no lights on at night. Poor service. I'd rather go to Sonic's down the street.  This Mc Donald's needs improvement.  Bad"
"3","This particular Albertson's is one of the bigger & better stores in my area.  Up in the North East area, we have slim pickin's when it comes to grocery stores & restaurants.  When my husband and I can't make it to Whole Foods, we buy our groceries here.  The produce is usually pretty good depending on what's in season.  We really like their fresh bread selection & the guys at the meat case are always really nice.  Albertson's discontinued their shopper's card program, so the prices are what you see is what you get."
"4","first time eating at sonic!  they need to open some of these in the bay area!  had the spicy southwest burger, which has crispy jalapeno strips, with some fries and a cherry limeaid drink.  pretty yummy!"
"2","We waited almost 35 mintues for two milkshakes. In the mean time, they rushed out food to cars behind us in the drive through - with orders that included ice cream.\nI have never seen a place more disorganized. The employees seemed to have no problem solving skills whatsoever. What a disappontment- they used to be so good!\nIn the end, they handed us a $2 off your next visit coupon (we don't live in Las Vegas, so we'll never be able to use it) as an apology for the poor service."
"5","Might have just been luck that I came in the afternoon with nobody in! I called in first, I was nervous on the phone cause I had a lame dilemma, and asked her that I had been going to this beauty salon back in S. California since I was a kid and I never knew what my hair was all about. It's one of things where you never think your going to move out of your city and you will have a person for everything. I explained to her that the woman who would cut my hair would call it a, \""Normal Hair Cut\"", but yeah that's not so detailed in description anything can seem normal.\n\n  So I go in and told her I was the guy on the phone and explained to her that I remember how she would handle my hair and which way she would comb it and grab it. So I had that going for me lol. One I told her she used to use a 4, or a 3 on the back and the sides, and somewhat made a fade look on the sides and used scissors on top she understood, or had an idea what I was talking about. What helped to was that she had old style hair cuts to compare too. So I think that wrapped up our theory.\n\n  So we sat down she cut it with a 4 first to see how it would look I already felt things were going well for me in just the way she started to cut it. She sure knew her cosmologist lingo. I came out learning things that I never even know and knowing me all the small detailed stuff always sticks to me... great haha. She was very nice and knowledgeable from the basics of what a hair cut is. I noticed things on my head that I never payed attention before. I just hope I don't turn into a, \""special person\"" when I go to get another hair cut. Thing that was weird for me was that she washed my hair after the hair cut. I was bedazzled... I'm like, \""huh?\"" She explained to me that some people during there lunch breaks go in to have a hair cut before there shift ends.\n\n  I completely forgot that business men and other professionals, come in and have that done. I thought that was a trend that ended years ago in America. I feel like doing that now. All in all I now have the recipe for my hair cut and don't feel my hair will be in danger anymore. I would call up other places and they wouldn't even try to understand me, it's a simple Mens hair cut! nothing fancy! Went to a barber before this place, but scared the living crap out of me!"
"3","The doctor and nurse staff are friendly and professional. I like that they do the lab and sonogram work in office so i don't have to drive around town. \nThe downside was they slapped me with a $1000 bill at the end of my pregnancy. It was supposed to be paid by the 28th week and the manager didn't advise me till the 32nd, mind you Ive been going there since i was 8 weeks. Every other patient had the luxury of paying the bill in increments, while i had to pay it all at once or the doctor wont deliver my baby. I guess they arnt aware of the sucky economy out there, most people would not be able to pull that much money out of their ass! Luckily i could afford it. I have been planning this pregnancy and everything that goes with it, it would have been nice to plan for that bill too! On top off it she had a pissy attitude about the payment like i was a deadbeat! F@#$ you C#$@ its not my fault you failed to do your job!"
"2","I had one appointment with Dr. Harter while I was baby doctor shopping after moving here from Boston. Moving from Boston, where ALL my my doctors, in every single discipline, had an ivy league education and were board certified to Las Vegas, where, well, that is sooo far from the case, proved to be a little challenging to find quality care. \nDr. Harter seems to have found his niche as Vegas' \""natural doctor\"" because he's the only one in the valley that does VBACs and water births. It's nice that he is supportive of this, but I got the impression that he is just in this field because it's probably pretty lucrative being the only one. I'm really passionate about natural birth and I asked him a ton of questions, like will baby and mom be left undisturbed for an hour after birth; what is the backup plan should Dr. Harter be attending another birth; how supportive is the hospital of breastfeeding; and the answers were just not really satisfactory by my standards. \nDr. Harter's procedures were also not only not consistent with natural-minded patients, but not really good practice for ANY OB. At the first appointment, he gave me a sheet of \""okay medications.\"" When you're pregnant, there's no such thing as universally \""okay medications!\"" And, there were medications on the sheet that have recently been linked to a three times increase in miscarriage (according to an article on CNN). So not okay! Not to mention, handing a sheet that says \""if you have a headache, take this\""; \""if you have a stomach ache, take this\""; means that he does not take the time to personally consult over what could be serious symptoms. My OB in Boston (who has her medical degree from Yale) advised me not to take ANY medications without checking with her first. \nDr. Harter also wheeled in an ultrasound machine, even though there was no indication whatsoever to do an ultrasound. The AAP, and the ACOG recommend against non-medically indicated ultrasounds, as there have been some studies pointing to possible harm of too many ultrasounds. Just the doppler is fine! But, a doctor can bill more to insurance for doing an ultrasound! \nAside from my experience with the doctor himself, the office staff was terrible! It took me over a month to get an appointment! They refused to book an appointment until I sent over my records from Boston, which I sent promptly, and they then LOST. Yes, they lost my medical records. So, I sent them again, and they never called me; I called them 2.5 weeks later. \nThe office really felt like a cattle call as well. There were sooo many people in the waiting room, and we waited for 2.5 hours!! Dr. Harter was attending a birth and didn't reschedule me or any of his other patients during this time (but hey, why lose the billable visits?). And, as much as I was not at all happy about the crazy unreasonable wait, I would really hate to be that poor woman giving birth with a doctor attending that knew in the back of his head that he had to get back as quickly as possible to see a rapidly growing list of waiting patients that he didn't reschedule. \nBut as awful as this sounds given all of the negatives above, if I HAD to have a doctor in Las Vegas, I would likely go with him, given the extremely slim pickings here and his at least openness to a natural approach (and he's board certified - again hard to find around here). But luckily, I found a fantastic midwife that I'm really really comfortable with."
"5","I can not say enough about this office, absolutely on point. The front desk is proficient, friendly and wonderful, the nurses are extremely caring and explain everything and above all my Doctor Dr. Wrightson is a gem. It is no secret that quality medical is hard to come by in Las Vegas, I found a doctor and an office that is 100% and I am thrilled.\n\nI definitely recommend Women's Specialty Care."
"1","This is the worst hospital I've ever seen.  One of my relatives came in for a life threatening heart condition.  Following an ambulance with a relative inside in is stressful enough.  Thankfully, the initial treatment went well.  \n\nHowever, somewhere from the ER into Intensive Care, quality of service dropped immensely.  It was many hours before we knew the room assignment. The head nurse the next day called at 6 AM  asking questions like \""What brand of pacemaker does the patient have?\"" Excuse me nurse, we sent you the medical records and most people don't know the brand of their pacemaker. They weren't awake when it was installed.\""  I wish I had taken that call.  \""What planet are you on, nurse?\""\n\nThen in asking them, \""What is the course of treatment?\"" The nurse didn't know.  It took them two days to tell us.  The doctor had written all that info down, but they \""Lost it\"". Not a comfortable feeling when a relative's life is in danger.  They took some unneeded tests that were already taken elsewhere. (Additional procedures means more money). The waiting rooms weren't very clean or comfortable. We complained to the doctor, and he said, \""Sorry about the lack of communication.  But this hospital struggles with that all the time\"". In fact, he said, \""I'm from California, and the medical system in LV is one of the most challenging I've seen.\""  Great, thanks for the info.\n\nAs a result, the actual hospital stay was two to three days longer that it should have been. There were other issues with the billing as well, By the way, many of my relatives are nurses and they could not believe how awful this place was.  Never again."
"2","This my third stay in two years.   I can see then trend downward in service and caring.   There are still some caring people here, but most seem to be losing interest in treating patients.  In two. Instances over the past few days,  employees simply shrugged and commented, \""Welcome to Summerlin   I have leukemia, so. I am in and out of hospitals.   This place has finally made it to the bottom of my list.   Still waiting for the sore throat lozenge I asked for an hour ago..."
"1","Could not find out what was wrong with me. Bad bedside etiquette. Never found out what was wrong with me after 20 visits, always felt rushed and that he had better things to do."
"3","HOLY TOLEDO batman!\n\nI just went through the drive thru and they got my order RIGHT and it tasted GOOD!\n\nThis is a first for this location!\n\nI only got a rodeo cheeseburger so maybe it was because I didn't make it too hard on them ?!?! ;)"
"4","My esteemed colleague on Facebook just mentioned that one is now open in WEST COVINA! Yes, still far, but way closer than Vegas! AWESOME!\n\nWest Covina\n2200 South Azusa Avenue\nWest Covina, CA 91792\nUS\nPhone: 626-839-4222\nFax: 626-839-5956"
"3","Low expectations which are usually exceeded."
"1","Longest wait for food ever.  Came in and there was only one table sitting down.   Ordered food at 12:05 (kids spaghetti and a chicken parm and spaghetti).  Watched people come in for lunch and all were served before us.  The girl came to us twice with food that wasn't ours.   Finally at 1230 the guy who took our order walks by and notices our number is still on the table and no food.  I dont know if they forgot us or gave our food to someone else, but a 25 minute wait for fast food is crazy."
"1","Stopped in this place and could not get past the lack of cleanliness and the terrible odor upon entry. This location definitely needs some attention to detail and cleanliness. We decided not to eat here based on the lack of cleanliness."
"3","Have not been to one of these places in a long time and I was reminded why, it is ok.  I can get way better food for the same price in a fancier place.  The choices are slim and the prices are ok for what you get.\n\nThis is not a place I would hurry back to ever, but if you are in the location of this place, there are not many choices unless you drive about a mile or two down the road, this literally is the only place in there right now.  A new restaurant will be opening up at some point and this may force this place to step up their game."
"5","Short version: If you want a massage, whether on your own or a couples massage, forget the sky-high prices on the strip and head over to Massage Pro. It's not a sleazy, cheapo place. It's cozy and professional.\n\nLong version: My husband and I decided to make an impromptu trip to Las Vegas. We booked our hotel two days in advance and winged it while we were there. We knew, though, that we wanted to get a couples massage.\n\nOf course, we headed to Yelp, and read lots of good reviews for the hotel spas, but oh my gosh--$400 for a 50 minute massage? Ouch. No thanks. So, I Googled \""couples massage\"" and came up with three non-day spa/hotel places in Vegas. I called all three, checked reviews on all three, and then checked appointment availability and came up with Massage Pro. Booked an appointment sight unseen, and crossed my fingers.\n\nThe place is right off the strip--just head west on Sahara for a couple miles. It'd be too much to walk, I think, but it's close enough that taking a taxi shouldn't be too expensive. We had our car with us and it was a very quick drive.\n\nWhen my husband and I walked into the office, we were a little worried--the reception is super small and feels a little like a dentist's office. We filled out our paperwork, and were taken back to a much more spacious waiting room with dimmed lights, relaxing music, and a little fountain. From there, we were met by our massage therapists. We did have to wait a little longer than we expected, but it was only seven minutes beyond our appointment time, and they more than made up for it during the session. I think they spent an extra ten or fifteen minutes on us to make it up to us. :)\n\nWe ordered the 90-minute combination massage, which was a blend of Swedish and deep-tissue techniques. We paid just $90 each! Even with a $20 tip on top of each massage, we were still under the next least expensive massage we could find--and the experience was phenomenal!\n\nWe had a male therapist and a female therapist (we had confirmed this was all right when we called and made our appointments) who guided us to a designated Couples Room specially set aside for couples massages. The room was decorated, dimmed, and had soothing music playing. The beds were heated and we were asked if they were to our liking temperature-wise. They were perfect.\n\nDid I mention the therapists are nationally and locally licensed? Yeah. Cool.\n\nSo began ninety minutes of rubby, relaxing bliss. The therapists were receptive to our suggestions--a little softer on that spot, please; a little harder right there. The therapists were nothing but the utmost of professionals, watching our muscles for the relaxation of knots and responses to too much pressure. They adjusted their techniques to our preferences and my husband and I had a wonderfully relaxing afternoon. We had very enjoyable massages.\n\nWe didn't pack robes with us, and, not being a day spa, they don't provide them, so they were kind enough to let us use their shower usually reserved for customers getting body scrubs so we could rinse off some of the massage lotion. We got big, fluffy towels to dry off with and they even gave us an extra one, just in case.\n\nIn short:\nUNBEATABLE prices\nProfessional, personable, skilled, licensed, receptive therapists\nCouples massage room!\nNot a day spa--ambiance is definitely service-oriented, but still decorated and cozy\nAwesome massage\nNot sketchy (they have zero tolerance for inappropriate behavior)\n\nWhat are you waiting for?! Book your vacation massage for less than the price of most show tickets!"
"3","I've realized there just aren't any \""hole in the wall\"" chinese restaurants here in Vegas with the same kind of raucous atmosphere and cheap eats back in NYC or SF.  But if I can get preferential treatment without having to speak in Cantonese I'm happy.  Based on first impression the attentiveness already seemed better than at HK Star.   How can I forget the smell the grease on the walls.  Agh!\n\nThis may not be a fair review since we didn't order any entrees.  Seafood dishes are usually how I measure great cantonese/hk style food.  Me and Andy T. had a late night snack and shared the Salted Fish and Chicken Fried Rice which was good.  I've had this served casserole style and the traditional way and some chinese restaurants don't even have this on their regular menu.  I suppose it's the in-n-out secret menu of fried rice at certain places.\n\nOverall, 3 stars for now.  I would come back again because I think if you ordered the right things here, there's room for improvement."
"2","I ordered the Pan fried noodles (Hong Kong Style) - it was alright. I've had better. Place lacks service."
"5","All I gotta say is.....YUMMY IN MY TUMMY!!!!!!  =)"
"1","Ok a one star is pretty hard for me to write but geez.  First off this is chinatown?  Maybe I'm spoiled from being from SoCal and having our own chinatown or even just towns where asians have naturally gravitated to have built their own unofficial chinatowns.  Either way it's not their fault but you can easily drive past this place without even knowing you just went through chinatown.\n\nEither way I ordered my normal choices of food and the food was barely edible.  I normally can dust off just about anything and never really leave left over especially when it comes to chinese food.  There is something about chinese food where all it takes is a couple sips of hot tea and you are ready to stuff your face still.  I really don't want to go on a laundry list of bad things but really nothing tasted like chinese food.  Even the batter used on the fried items is nothing like I've had before and was more like something you would put on fried chicken.\n\nWhen you walk in the door it's not like you have the highest hopes initially anyways since the fish are dead in the tank when you walk in.  Those that think this is authentic chinese food, you've been stuck in vegas too long."
"3","Came here because fellow elite Emmagelle B. and Ryan M. are regulars here claiming it's their favorite place to get their Chinese food fix. Myself +2 came on a Monday around 2pm. Upon walking in I immediately notice it is a tad smaller compared to the other popular joints in town.  It wasn't busy at all because there were 2 tables with customers, which worked in our favor because our food came out within 10-15 minutes. We ordered batchoy, some type of crispy house special noodle, sauteed shrimp, fried flounder, and salt and pepper pork chop. The batchoy was kind of whatever wish we would of ordered a tastier vegetable dish, the noodles were good, but I was not in awe, sauteed shrimp was accompanied with onions and green peppers, but the onions made up 75% of the dish and the dish overall was okay. Fried flounder was crisp, but another \""okay\"" taste as well. And most places don't mess up salt and pepper pork chop. Food was between okay and good, but I have definitely had better. On the plus side the service was good for a Chinese place because our server Jing gave us all our needs. I hate to mention their competitor on here, but HK Star will still be my spot for getting my Chinese fix on. Thank you!"
"4","Discount after 10pm which is great for me =) I eat late."
"1","Each year during the last 7 years, we would go to this place for Chinese when we were in town for a trade show.  It's noisy and cramped,  but the food was good and the price was ok. But after this year's experience we've decided they're not worth it.  Their services suck. The waiters/waitresses are typically rude, and worse yet very ineffective.  For two days in a row they somehow managed to lose our phone reservation, and wouldn't accommodate us. Obviously they're clueless that we were returning customers, and there are many other options in Las Vegas."
"1","Not good at all. I had to add soy and spice just to make the Fuk-Jin Seafood fried rice edible. Looked like a $14 TV dinner and had chicken in place of most of the seafood. Strangely the menu didn't mention chicken. I had to ask for the included dessert. I guess I didn't spend enough for my $14 fried rice! I will not be back and you would be wise to try some of the great Chinese restaurants in the area."
"1","So disappoint... We ordered a live lobster but It turned out to be a dead one. Ruining my taste."
"5","The food was really good!  Great spice!  \n\nReally enjoyed the meal!"
"3","We came here for Thai food with one $. It was a little pricier than expected and servings weren't generous. Decor is cute. Space is tiny. A-ok if this is your neighborhood Thai spot. No need to go out of your way."
"2","HORRIBLE customer service. My sister and I went there after having no success at finding a brides maid dress from David's Bridal. No one greeted us. After browsing for 10 minutes I finally had to find someone to help us. I told her what we were looking for and she just brushed us off. It was a terrible experience. That alone caused them to lose our business. They get 2 stars because the dresses were beautiful and they had a decent amount of accessories to chose from. I would never suggest this place to anyone."
"2","Called about a fuel leak on my cts. The service advisor didn't want to look up my information to tell me if my car had warranty coverage, and didn't want to even listen to my problem. He just kept cutting me off mid sentence saying \""get it into me\"" and gave me the impression he didn't want to be on the phone. He also told me they would not have a replacement car for me to use while they serviced my cts. After I got off the phone I opted to take the cts to Findlay Cadillac instead even though its much further from my house and I had a great experience there. See my review for them if your Caddi needs service."
"3","everyone is super nice here. wait is never too long. \n\ntwo gripes.\n\n1.) had commercials for e-cigarettes on the tv.\n2.) they never seem to send my x-rays or mri scans when they say they will to my doctors..."
"5","I like Sammys, it's not bad of a chain. I like that they have something for everyone, different flavor fusions. \n\nPizza has a nice crust and I love all the flavor combos- I like the garlic shrimp so far. Duck tacos were good.My favorite thing is the ahi or salmon sliders. I've been to this one like 3 times and a total of 5 times to a different location so I havent tried much, but all has been good and satisfying portions.\n\n Why I give it 5 stars is the service was very attentive, some of the best I've gotten at a casual joint actually. This location has a very attentive staff, back of the house was quick with orders but still cooked things right- kudos! One lunch day in particular a mens baseball team, their kids and familes filled the restaurant soon after we ordered. Our waiter was taking care of us even though they got sieged. Drinks didn't get neglected, had a drink before mine was done. Checked on us often and got our tab taken care of fast.  I do appreciate when people are warm and genuinely friendly- service with a smile does count just as equally as speed and attentiveness."
"4","That sundae is ridiculous. DO IT!"
"5","My wife and I went for Happy Hour the yesterday. They have happy hour everyday from 4-6pm and again the bar area from midnight till 8am. All tapas are half price. we got skewers, pot stickers, coconut shrimp and lettuce wraps with a couple of soft drinks for 25 bucks. Food was very good. Service and price were great. We also tried their new desert which was warm donuts. The waiter said since it was our first time trying it it was on him. Cant beat it. Will defiantly be back very soon for more tapas."
"4","I love a good salad - and Sammy's has some of my favorites! They have several options in the $10ish range, and service is speedy so it's a great stop for lunch. I like the shrimp salad with feta cheese and sunflower seeds and the chinese chicken salad is a close second. While their pizzas are pretty fantastic (Brie and mushroom, heck yes!), their lighter fare is quite tasty as well."
"2","Wife and I stopped recently for lunch.  She ordered the chicken wrap; me the Chinese chicken salad.  It took nearly 30 minutes to get the order filled.  Waitress apologized.  Said the chicken was being fresh cooked.  Manager finally came by and offered us a free tapas to ease the wait (nice touch).  But when dishes finally arrived, I found about 5 pieces of chicken in my heaping salad that taste wise had been compromised by an over generous drenching of some kind of dressing (sesame oil, I think) that produced more heat than taste.  Wife's wrap was more robust with chicken, but not noticeably fresh cooked.  Overall, a poor experience."
"4","Great service. The food was awesome we order a royal Hawaiian pizza, cheese bread (looks like and is the same size as their pizzas), roasted chicken w/pesto dish. All the food had great flavors, the only thing I would change was the ventilation of the restaurant the fire wood scent was very strong, other than that I'd say it was overall a great place."
"5","Love, Love, Love this place.  Always consistent.  Happy hour is a Steal!!! This place has always been in my top five!!"
"5","Loved this place. The duck tacos were fantastic. Also I would highly recommend the messy sundae."
"1","Quality Garage Doors was originally sent us by our home warranty company.  The first trip to our house was good until last week when our garage wouldn't open. After investigating it had not been calibrated. Called company back and they said they would fix it no charge. They advised they would come out this Saturday from 12pm-4pm. My fianc\u00e9 waited and waited. Finally started calling them several times starting around 3pm as we were getting concerned. No one answered, kept getting voice recording although it says they are supposed to be open till 4:30pm. Like you, our time is valuable especially around the holidays. We wasted an afternoon waiting on this company just to be no showed."
"1","This place was horrible and depressing for me. I thought it would be nice like the ones I've been to back in California but was I wrong. You would not want to come here to shop for baby gears. This place is so ghetto, it's kinda freightening. Yes, they may have really cheap prices but the quality of stuff is pretty budget too. For about the same price, I prefer to go to Target instead."
"4","I used to HATE going to burlington because it always looked like\nclothes, shoes and housewares threw up in a giant space and to find anything you had to wade in knee deep.\nWell, not anymore. They have great signage now that makes finding what you want easy peas-y!\nI was super pleasantly surprised. \nAs long as they keep the store looking as spiffed up as it is now.. \nI will undoubtedly be a frequent customer..!"
"4","I never used to enjoy this store. The lines and checkout were atrocious and the shelves and racks were unorganized and picked through. Fast forward to my most recent visit the store is ten times better than before. \n\nThis location went through a miracle makeover recently. The checkout lines were reorganized and are now clean and swift to navigate through. The aisles and shelves were revitalized as well. The shelves were organized and the displays were much more aesthetically pleasing. \n\nAlthough Burlington is still not my favorite chain of retail establishments, I'll definitely start frequenting this location more often."
"3","This is one messy store, but wow: they have some cheap clothes and accessories! On my recent adventure, I found a high-low dress for $10 and a shirt for $5. But I think that my best deal from here had to be my 7 dollar sunglasses! They're hot! :) Besides summer is coming up and ya gotta protect your eyes! Though, when buying clothes, my suggestion is know your size and body really well because those fitting room lines tend to get kinda long! \n\nOf course, the quality of clothes is not that great, but hey, its cheap right?! But I have to say that the one good thing about this store is that it has a ton of selections. It almost makes you dizzy how overflowing with stuff this store is! \n\nAlso, be weary of when they feel your clothes with metal sensors. They tend to forget taking them out! Happy shopping!!"
"3","So I came for another work lunch since they have decent lunch specials and just wanted something simple. \n\nThis visit was made uncomfortable by a health inspection going on. \n\nThe most important thing for me was that they didnt make a stink on the temperature or cleanliness of the sushi because it was fine. That is by far the number one thing because that's what I'm eating. The chef washes their hands religiously between different orders and when coming back to the bar from the back- second most important thing.\n\nWhat made it uncomfortable is that I'm sitting at the bar and two inspectors are reaming the sushi chef about this and that. That's just not cool to do in front of customers even if it is a kitchen nightmare. \n\nI almost said something about some points being made. Like somehow they said you cant prepare sushi without gloves and that it is violation. What?! What sushi place, hell, what food kitchen wears gloves?! I don't want fucking glove particles in food and almost no respectable high end chef will agree with that being \""cleaner\"". Apparently you have to have a contract with the city for it.....err, that just sounds like some sort of business racket that they probably charge money to obtain. You can \""feel\"" the right cut of fish with gloves on.  They got on him about not having a 3 compartment sink. They had two separate small sinks..... etc, etc. \n\nI think the health inspection is a fabulous idea but they get really hung up on the details that are trivial. \n\nI had to leave and stuffed my food in my mouth fast. I was getting really annoyed at how unprofessional it was to be discussing this in front of me."
"2","I wanted to try a NEW AYCE Sushi place and this came up since I was nearby after getting my oil changed at Midas and it was date night with Hunnie Bunnie. \nHB had her Udon Noodles and Edamame (these come UNsalted).. \nI ordered Ahi Poke (This had cucumber salad, seaweed salad and small pieces of Ahi tuna. I mean, it was SMALL. Not like any of the other Ahi Poke i've had before at other restaurants. In fact, Amando S. can make Ahi Poke better than this place!), Fried Calamari (this was SO good, I LOVED it, I put in a second order for it! NOM!!), Baked Scallop Shell (Not bad at all, oily of course as they usually are, but apparently not as oily as the Dynamite, but it was tasty.), Baked Green Mussels (Small mussels but they were good), Fried Gyoza (I was not a fan of the flavor of these and neither was HB, I tried to pawn them off to her but she wasn't interested), Fried Shumai (I wasn't a fan of these either but HB LOVED them. She gobbled them up), a Spider Roll (This was so hard to get down, but probably because I was insanely full but it came with 8 pieces... I had asked the server for a half order but she said it only came in five pieces anyway, would I like them to make it small? Yes I would. So I guess \""small\"" meant small pieces, but MORE pieces. HUMPH. , Salmon & Avocado Handroll (this was good, my favorite type of handroll!), Sweet Shrimp (it came out with just the sweet shrimp nigiri... I was like Ummm do you fry the heads too?? She said YES and brought some out to me a little later, but I guess you have to ask for this item along with the sweet shrimp!), Tuna, Salmon and Hamachi nigiri (these were FINE. Nothing special. Honeslty it didn't taste THAT fresh.)\nI've experienced better sushi at other places, so I don't plan to go back here, but the service was good and the Calamari was delicious! I just wasn't too impressed with the fish!"
"4","3 1/2 stars. Doesn't have the number of rolls that most places have. \n\nA little joint in a strip mall. I was afraid to go in but we were with friends who rave about it. There was only one other table when we arrived but many more when we left. We all did AYCE. Delivery was fairly quick. Cajun is amazing. We loved the super crunch roll although we ordered a second after devouring the first and it was not the exact same roll. Ordered snow crab twice and never got it.  They cut off our ordering on two different occasions. \n\nThis is not really close to areas of town we frequent. I had been craving AYCE and this definitely filled my itch. If you are in the area and looking for a place you should give it a shot."
"2","Taste: 2.5\nCreativity/Authenticity: 3.5\nAtmosphere: 2.5\nService: 5\nBang for your buck: 3\n\nIll leave my sushi cravings for nobu and kabuto. Only came here because someone told me they serve authentic traditional japanese sushi.. This place is as far from traditional as sushi goes, not a lot of choices and not so great fish. If you don't know sushi isn't fresh (only certain dishes like sweet shrimp or clam killed on the spot) Sushi can sit for weeks in a freezer building flavor like cured meat, so when people say the fish wasn't fresh they are probably white haha JK or eat rolls covered in sauce. Take my word for it this place probably makes good rolls of sushi but as far as traditional sushi the real stuff that i only eat ill pass on that. The service here was great well only because there was no one there. The atmosphere is very cater to white people on the inside the outside its just another store in a parking lot. Overall like i said before if you want real sushi one your gonna have to pay for it and well you get what you pay for. Overall the only thing i like about this spot is the all you can eat which makes my girlfriend happy and the fact that the chef (owner) was very friendly and honest because we stuck to ordering sushi only no rolls and not all you can eat but he told us at the end of the night it would be cheaper for us to just go with all you can eat so they are very kind and honest about that and i thank you."
"2","Its ok compared to the restaurants in Socal. the service is average. but i don't know if its just me but it seems like the wings taste different."
"1","My boyfriend & I reserved this room because it was one of the cheaper hotels on the Vegas strip; so we were in no way expecting the luxury of the Bellagio. But during our 3 night stay we were increasingly annoyed with the problems in the hotel & unhelpful front desk staff. I will never be staying here again, I don't care how good of a deal it is. \n\n#1- The door to the Bungalow building takes about 15 tries to unlock. They need a new lock on that building, badly. \n\n#2- The adjoining door between our room & the room next to us didn't lock on our side (lock was broken), so the neighbors could have come into our room if they wanted to. \n\n#3- We had to have maintenance come fix the toilet first thing in the morning on 2 of our days there. \n\nAll of that could have been forgiven. They have $1.50 beers in their bars, $3 blackjack tables, a decent pool (even though the waterfall was broken), and a pretty convenient location. BUT.... \n\n#4- On day 2 I decided I didn't want to pay for the hotel with my debit card & asked the hotel to switch over to my credit card. To make a long story short they screwed it up & ended up tying up $536 in charges & holds on my credit & debit accounts, for a room that cost $181 total. Supposedly they submitted a reversal for the charges, but I have yet to see it process on my account (it's been 2 days so far).\n\nI went to the desk to complain to the manager (who first off had the front desk girl tell me that the manager was out on lunch, then she magically appeared after I wasn't going away), who did absolutely nothing but give me a blank stare. I resorted to listing all of the other complaints I had about the hotel in an attempt to get a reaction from her, or at least some sort of compensation, but she still said nothing other than \""I'm sorry about that\"". I became so frustrated I ended up leaving the hotel in tears. \n\nI was expecting a budget hotel because that's what I paid for; I was NOT expecting a VACATION RUINER. I won't be returning to this craphole, not even for their $1.50 beers, simply because I'm so pissed at my experience here.\n\nIf you do come to Hooters, just go for the cheap drinks & gambling. Go down the street to Imperial Palace if you're looking for a cheap room."
"1","This was our 3rd and final time ever staying here.  Our first stay was shortly after it opened, but sadly, the quality is really bad now. We have always known its not a 5 star hotel (Hotwire rates it a \""3\""... really?!) and never expected it to be, but we kept coming back because we really like the location - right near all the other big, popular casinos , how easy it is to get to your rooms, and loads of free parking. Realistically, it should now be 1 1/2 star rating.  Here's why - the air quality in the rooms is horrid, the bed smelled bad, the bed sheets smelled nasty, the carpet is stained and smells moldy.  When you wake up in the morning be warned -  you'll have a bunch of yuck in your throat.  \n\nMaybe I'm being too harsh, a group of homeless people liked it enough to set up camp on the northeast corner.  They were nice - I mean the one passed out on the only sidewalk to get anywhere from Hooters moved out of the way quick enough when asked.  \n\nThe sidewalk (past the homeless people) you'll discover a gauntlet of trash, pee, hundreds of nasty cans, bottles, dirt, clothes, shoes, and food.  I know its not Hooter's responsibility to monitor this, but common sense should kick in here - it's THE ONLY SIDEWALK OUT and if I were in charge I'd send my own people there to clean up the trash and steam clean the sidewalk.  It would take 2 hours at the most.  Your guests use this sidewalk so its pretty much your porch and its terrible to have to walk thru this every time you want to go.\n\nShame on you Hooter's!"
"2","Uhm... I'm not even sure what to say about this place. It was uhm interesting. Friends are staying here for the week, and their room smelled gross. They basically had to constantly keep their door/window open to let the room air out. The hall smelled like urine. The rooms itself looks a little outdated, but the beds were comfy so i guess thats one positive thing. I personally wouldn't stay here. Ever. I'm really not that picky, this place just sucks. Yeah, sure, hooters rooms are cheap, but you get what you pay for... I guess if you intend on staying here, come here with an open mind, or shit-faced so you can't remember how shitty your room was haha. After all, thats the point of coming to Vegas, right?"
"2","I have stayed here many times, but I will now find somewhere else to stay.\n\nThe front desk people are never very friendly.  \n\nOur first room of this last visit was nasty.  The bathroom tile was coming up and the door hinges were rusty and the paint was coming off the wall near the tub.  The tub had grout coming off.  No continuing maintenance is going on.  \nOur A/C did not work and we had to be transferred at 11:30 pm to another room.  This means that the maid did not report it not working or that they did not fix it.\n\nOur second room was almost as bad.  The bathroom was in the same sorry shape, but the room was nicer.  \n\nThe Casino is always fun and great priced for being small and off the strip.  The pool can get a little crowded, but the pool bar and hooters restaurant overlooking the pool are fun.\n\nI won't be back until some remodel is done.  Going to try the \""New\"" Tropicana."
"2","SLOW SERVICE....the food was gross, chicks(waitresses) weren't hot and a bit rude also, maybe it was a bad night, but I been to the one in san diego and that was a WAYYYY better experience, food wasn't great there either but at least the waitresses were hot looking and they were very attentive and courteous."
"3","SSSSSsssssshhhhhhhhhhh.............. DON'T TELL ANYONE. I like Hooters. \n\nSo, here's the story: We booked a great bargain at the Hilton, but it was only two nights. We needed a place to stay for our last night in Vegas, and we wanted something cost effective and close to the airport because of our ultra-early flight out. Hooters fit the bill. It's at the far South end of the strip, so the cab ride to McCarran is quick. It isn't fancy and there are cheap rooms to be had, so we tried it. \n\nThe guy at the registration desk couldn't have been nicer. We asked for a nonsmoking king on a high floor, and he delivered. We had an amazing view of the Tropicana, Excalibur, and the roller coaster at New York New York. The room was BASIC, but OK. \n\nYou can walk across the street to the MGM and that's what we did for most of the day. \n\nIn the evening, we went back to the Hooters Casino, and guess what? We had a blast!!!! The minimum bets are LOW, so playing feels like PLAYING. It's not as serious as at the high-end casinos. The crowd is young and you don't feel like you have to be \""world champion\"" level to play the tables. Let's face it, I'm not a serious gambler, nor would I want to be, so the atmosphere at Hooters was just my speed."
"4","The rooms are clean & the air conditioning works great! Prices are pretty good & the more you play there, the better deals you can get. I've had good & bad experiences with the counter people @ check-in & out.\n\nThere are multiple pools - all with different temperatures & a bar located by the pools. \n\nThe location is awesome. I love gambling @ MGM, but don't want to pay the prices to stay there. It's about a $10 ride to the airport.\n\nThe casino atmosphere is fuuuun. The music is great, the Craps table gets busy as soon as it opens. The roulette tables light up, which is definitely entertaining. (Play 29!) Poker area isn't the largest - usually only one table open so there are definitely better places to play that :) \n\nTwo bars - one in the front and one halfway through the casino floor.\n\nThe actual Hooters restaurant has GREAT food. Their wings are simply amazing. You can order all drumsticks if you want for like 10 cents each. The wait can be a little long, but the service is typically decent.\n\nThe Mad Onion restaurant inside is open 24 hours & they have some great deals, but the service is shotty & the wait can be FOREVER. They say they make the same wings as the restaurant, but they don't taste like them at all. The old restaurant used to be great, but since the name change & I'm assuming the new staff, it SUCKS.\n\nOverall: good, clean, cheap place to stay."
"1","Stayed 2 days 7/9-7/11 Omg this was the worst hotel in vegas that i ever stayed at. I wasn't asking for too much but a fridge and a up to date tv would have been nice in the room...i booked the room through hotels.com and i should have had my antennas up when i saw that they were giving up the room at $37 a night but i also didn't think that hooters would degrade themselves like this. First of all i reserved a room with double beds which was unavailable (isn't that what reserve means?) so being that they didn't have my requested room available they put me in a room with one bed and had the nerve to say it was 10 extra dollars!!! Wth?? because supposedly it was strip view which that was an understatement then they asked for a $50 deposit the keys kept not working making it where i had to keep going down to the front desk then when we checked out on the 11th they deducted $8.67 from my $50 deposit stating that it was for their amenities (pool, phones, etc.) which i never took advantage of so now that i know that they are full of it NEVER AGAIN!"
"1","The absolute worst!!! STAY AWAY!!!! The convenience of the hotel in conjunction to the rest of the strip and the price means absolutely nothing. Always remember the old saying, \""you get what you pay for\"". For a new hotel, everything was old.. even the clock radio. Hell, the tv was a Zenith (and not a flat screen). Who the hell in this day and age does not have a flat screen in their hotel?? Even the Riviera, which is a heck of a lot older, has flat screens and waaaaaaaaaaaay better customer service. \nDon't ask the SUPERVISOR (not manager as he told us) NOE for any assistance. He was completely useless, talked really low as if he wasn't confident in what he was saying and finally walked away without completing the transaction at hand.\nAlso, when we got to our room we had no remote, no menu, no ice bucket. We called room service for these items and they told us that we would have to come down stairs for the remote and menu and the ice we had to pay $1.00/cup if we wanted them to bring us ice (not only was there no ice bucket but the ice machine on the 6th floor didn't work). WTH!! Where is the customer service?? Where is my menu? Where is my remote?? Where is anything!! And let's not forget the living room-sized casino. \nAll in all this was the worst Vegas hotel experience EVER."
"1","I know, I know - what would you expect?  Still, no matter how trashy the theme I do expect to get what I paid for.  True, the Hooters casino is as poorly cleaned and maintained as one of their restaurants, but the rooms were not quite so bad as the typical Hooters restroom and one has to expect a certain griminess to go with the low room costs - that could potentially be some of the fun of the aesthetic that Hooters touts, I suppose.\n\nWe came to the Hooters casino because some friends were already booked here and we wanted to spend some time with them after we had rested some, and enjoy exploring Las Vegas.  They, my partner, and I had just spent a week first on a grueling 1900 mile road trip from Austin to northern Nevada and then camping in a barren desert for the Burning Man art festival - and figured it would be nice to spend some time with each other just decompressing.  So we decided we would pay ahead for a room with a bed big enough for both of us, knowing that it would take all day to drive through Nevada from Black Rock Desert to Las Vegas.\n\nWe paid ahead for a room with a King size bed for three nights, got up at 7:30 am and drove all day from Burning Man in North Nevada, got in around 11 pm exhausted and haggard, looking forward to nothing more than just crawling into a clean comfortable bed with each other and relaxing, before spending  - and they tell us that they will only put us in a room with two doubles and told us in a bored voice, \""too bad, even though you paid ahead for a king room, it is first come first served.  Tough, there is nothing we can do, that's policy.\"" In effect, you can only get what you paid for if you come at checkin time - paying for the room ahead of time does not actually secure it.  \n\nOur friends were, of course, screwed over by the same policy and were no happier about it.\n\nAvoid any business that does not deal honestly with its customers like this - this is worse than what you would reasonably expect from Hooters and Las Vegas combined.  I expect trashiness from Hooters and sleazy business practices from Las Vegas - but bait and switch is outside the bounds of any business claiming to be reputable."
"3","I stayed here last weekend with a few of my buddies. I thought it was the perfect place if you're young, like 21 (like me), and limited on money. Can't go wrong with $3 blackjack, 50 cent roulette, and $1.50 beers.\n\nThe room was standard, but since we only spent about 3-4 hours in it altogether the whole weekend, it was okay. I got a bit aggravated when the cocktail waitresses would only come around every 30-40 min at the tables, but they were busy so I thought what the hell.\n\nAlso have 25 cent wings after midnight, but you're required to belong in their little owl club or whatever to be able to get the deal."
"1","Horrible place. Will never stay here again. i'd rather stay in Motel 6 which is a block from them (stayed there a few years ago and had a very pleasant expirience).\n1. Dirty elevator in the garage (kind of scary)\n2. No wifi available at ALL\n3. Smells like smoke everywhere, even on the hotel floors\n4. Horrible beds that squick every time you turn\n5. uncomfortable pillows\n6. no coffee maker\n7. rooms are old and outdated\n8. half the rooms have the view of the airport with the noise and everything that comes along with it."
"1","Swankier than I remember in the past and that was a complete surprise! We had some time to kill and seeing that we are usually someplace mid strip, we were staying at MGM this time and decided to take a stroll over to Hooters just to appease my curiousity. It really hasn't changed much but it appears they got a new coat of paint and some new carpet. Gambling there is cheap....the drinks are waaaay cheaper than at the \""nicer\"" casinos so I can't really complain. It's a bit out of the way but if you like their wings (which I don't) they have $0.25 wings every day after 10 pm.  I wouldn't stay here but if you are looking for a cheap alternative and the Imperial Palace isn't your cup of tea on the strip you can stay at Hooters for less than $20 a night. Unfortunately, it makes my stomach turn just thinking about it."
"5","This hotel doesn't have the glamour of other hotels on the strip if that's what you're looking for, but the dealers were very courteous and made great conversation as well"
"2","Your review helps others learn about great local businesses.\nI ordered 50 wings to go b/c we were heading back to San Diego.  They were hot, but they tasted only ok.  I've had better at other Hooters.\nPlease don't review this business if you received a freebie for writing this review, or if you're connected in any way to the owner or employees."
"2","Not good I'm afraid,, I was rudely awakened by a maid bumping his vacuum on my door repeatedly at 9am and when I finely decided to get up and open the door the guy just had a smile on his face and I said what the f--ks up with banging on my door at 9am and all he said he was \""it wasn't him\"" WTF?? I called downstairs and was put on hold , I waited and waited and my call was not taken after two tries so I go downstairs to jump in somebody's ass and all I get was a the run around ,The supervisor Said I could have a late checkout and assured me no one else would bother me and he would call housekeeping and let Them know not to knock,, what happens !! The maid walks in on me just as i was falling back asleep:-( guess that's why this place is on its way down. Iv stayed here lots and lots of times over the passed few years and I think Iv stayed there for the last time.. I served in Baghdad and was treated better:-/"
"1","Hello everyone, \n\nI had to create a Yelp account just to inform people how HORRIBLE this hotel really is. Where to start. We got in on a Friday, when we got to the room it smelled horrible. The TP holder was under the sink in the corner with TP rolls sitting on the counter. They must of been to lazy to pick it up and put it back. After I fixed that I sat down to relax and watch some TV.. Well that was a JOKE! I turned on the TV and every channel was staticky and couldn't watch... Yes, I had a nice view of the pool. But as I opened the sliding door to the balcony (which you could only take one step out on and no room to move) the door almost FELL off. I had to catch it before it went over the railing...... The carpets were filthy!! Location SUCKS! After the horrible weekend at hooters I was so glad to get home to a nice clean environment.. I get a call from hooters saying we got charged an extra $300 for the \""Damages\"" . WORST HOTEL EVER DO NOT STAY HERE! SAVE YOUR MONEY AND UPGRADE TO THE MOTEL 6 NEXT DOOR."
"3","I booked here with a bit of apprehension but we were going to a concert across the street at the MGM and the price was half of the MGM  We had a great time here. Service was excellent, pool was very nice and the room was great. It was not as nice or as clean as the MGM but well worth the money,  There is, of course, a Hooters restaurant but the Mad Onion restaurant was excellent food and service.  Would stay again in a heartbeat"
"2","Review is for the restaurant only:\n\nWas staying next door at the Trop and decided to walk over to Hooters for lunch.  Was seated quickly and the waitress took my order quickly as well, so far so good.  The problem was they messed my burger up three different ways.  Follow this:  I ordered a bacon cheeseburger, no tomato, with mayo, American cheese.  Seems simple right?  I got a bacon cheeseburger, with tomato, no mayo, cheddar cheese?  Wha?!?  Waitress disappeared so I took the tomato off and walked over and got mayo from the bartender.  Ate the burger, and when the waitress came with the check she asked me how the meal was, I told her how they messed up three different parts of one burger order.  Her response?  \""Oh, you know how the kitchen can be\"".  WHAT?!??!?  NO I DON'T KNOW HOW THE KITCHEN CAN BE I DON'T WORK HERE!  Jesus nice customer service.  No effort to make things right, just a dismissive comment about how the kitchen can be.  I give this restaurant 2 stars instead of 1 because the fries were good and the burger was at least cooked, but holy hell, learn some customer service (or just learn to make the orders right to begin with)"
"1","My husband and me stayed for a weekend in August of 2013. The room was standard, no flat screen tv. It was a nice stay until we checked out and got home. I realized I had left my iphone charger in the room. I called the hotel immediately and requested that they send it back to me (southern California). It has been almost 3 weeks now and I have not yet received my charger. When I called the first time, I had transfer after transfer on the phone. No body could tell me when I would get my charger back. I even spoke to the hotel manager once or twice and she promised me I would get it in the mail the follow friday. No charger. So warning to everyone do not leave items behind. They dont know how to give it back!"
"2","Get wut u pay for under 70\nRemonte for tv didnt work, water in the bath was running when we got room, wouldnt turn off ran all night, also a spider in the sink..... The only thing that will make me not come back it when we walked in the room it smelled like old cooking oil...... Made me not want to order any wings... Stayed here for one night before stay at resort"
"3","Ok place to stay for the price, food not so good....did not enjoy food inside Hooters restaurant, burger dry & wings tasteless, dont sleep with women so why did I wake up with another woman's hair on my body in my bed? Mad Onions $9.99 prime rib dinner good except for extremely thick dry mashed potatoes. Would stay again for lodging price & locations but would rather not eat there."
"1","Pretty bad atmosphere. I have been waiting for 30 minutes with 8 other people to sit at a 3 dollar 6-5 blackjack table and they won't open another table or even a $5 table."
"3","Hey all! Well this place is definitely not the ritz. However, when my flight got cancelled and I was not sure what to do when I had to stay the night, this place was cheap and affordable! Though it is an older hotel and it is noticeable it is clean. The food downstairs is still great wings like hooters always has! In addition, tables are cheaper (which is nice) than the other spots. It is not on the strip though around the corner from the strip. And being across from the MGM and next to Tropicana you can just walk through them to get to the strip too. \n\nThe hotel is also quiet compared to most others including others that are off the strip.  It also has free wi-fi. The customer service is ok, some are beyond nice, such as setting up a players card, in the restaurant but the hotel management is not always the best. But in that sense you are still getting a deal with what you pay for. \n\nDefiantly would stay again not the first place but if I had to stay cheaply or got screwed  again by the airlines I know I could get a room, quickly too, and it would be clean and a good place to sleep as well as continue to gamble and be close to the action."
"3","For a place that's supposedly known for wings, it wasn't so good. I was very hungry but couldn't finish the 20 wings I was sharing with my friend. The 10 grilled wings were tossed in this super spicy tangy Cajun sauce. Eeee. Should've had the sauce on the side. The other 10 wings had sauce on the side but the batter was chalky tasting. Eeee.\n\nThe shrimp and spinach salad was good. Tsk. Was so craving good wings though."
"5","When you want wings, you want to head to Hooters...try to get seated in Ashley S's section (preferably when Mike Lee is working) and you'll get INCREDIBLE service matched only by Ashley's adorable smile!"
"2","Hooters restaurant is like it is everywhere.  Crap.  The ladies had no hooters themselves.  The food is never great.  The hotel room was not great had an iron burn on the carpet rooms need to be updated and they charge u for drinks when your gambling.  Ok if you can get the room really really cheap"
"5","We went there with our friends from Germany to watch the amazing 7:1 soccer game. The food was great but our server LINDSEY was even greater! Super nice, patient, always a smile on her face and a great server! She made a good experience a great one. THANKS LINDSEY!!!!"
"1","Big Black bugs in my bungalow room. They moved us up to a tower room.. the toilet was broken... Then moved us to a suite and housekeeping went through our stuff and took a pack of cigarettes. Staff rude. The only thing they got going is the wings. Will NEVER stay there again."
"2","First of all, I wasn't expecting much considering that we were staying at Hooters.  BUT there is a common \""customer service\"" factor that should exist within every hotel be it a cheap or expensive one.   My friend and I were there for a 3-day music festival, so we were rarely in our hotel room, which gave housekeeping plenty of time every day to come into our rooms to tidy up. This only happened once and on the day before we were checking out.  The bell man who helped us to our room with all of our luggage was extremely smug and you could tell that he hated his life. Sorry dude... get a different job, don't bring me into your dislike for what you do, I didn't force you to work here.  We ordered room service a couple times.  One of the times an extremely snotty girl named Marian was more than awful to my friend and I, not only did she get the order wrong, but when we called to get it fixed she argued with us and told us that they took pictures of every order leaving the kitchen... if that was the case she would be able to see that it was wrong, but proceeded to argue before finally sending someone up with the 2 items that we needed to make it right.  Another time we were walking up to the host stand to get a menu to take to our room and the girls at the front kept saying how drunk they were and were giggling too much to pay attention to us standing in front of them.  \n\nOn the plus side, the A/C works really well, the blackout curtains are a gem, and the water pressure in the shower was really on point.   We did have an older bell man that helped us take our luggage TO our car when we were leaving and that man was super helpful and friendly.  He even helped us with directions on how to get out of Vegas from where we were. \n\nI'm not sure if I would ever stay there or really recommend  this hotel to any of my friends. I've definitely stayed at a lot better hotels, so maybe I'm a bit bias as to what to expect."
"1","This hotel has no customer service at all!! No smiles,no nice greeting,and bad attitude at check in. (like they forced to be there) I called housekeeping as soon as we checked in because there was no remote in the room and the person that answered was rude and said \""remote?? Remote for what?? I was like for the TV?? Is there something else in the room that needs a remote??? \nRooms are very old but loved their beds though (at least the one we had) \ndon't think I would stay there again"
"4","I was surprised by the generous portions of lettuce with that came with my order of spring rolls.  Attentive and quick service.  Never had a problem flagging down one of the 4 servers on duty.  An all around good experience.  The first pho I've had in Vegas.  While not the best broth I've ever tasted, it wasn't disappointing."
"5","Perhaps, one of the best Pho places that I have been to. The menu is very big so you have a lot of choices. Whatever Pho you order, they include a lot of meat. The waiters are polite and courteous - they didn't get offended or gave me a blank stare when I asked for a fork.\n\nThe place is nicely decorated and crowded., but we didn't have to wait to get a table.  Awesome place to go to if you are in Vegas. It was only about 10min drive from the strip. I'd recommend this place if you really want a quality bowl of Pho in Vegas."
"3","The first time I went to Pho 8 I was just getting over a cold (no, I wasn't contagious) and felt the need for a soup. After sampling the wonton bowl, I thought it was the best place on the planet. It was so good that I ended up back a week later, only to discover that while it was still pretty good, their plastic drinking glasses and plastic soup spoons reek of bleach or some other cleansing agent. Nice to know they are sanitized, but I could live without the chemical infusion with my lunch. \n\nGood soup, clean place, but a little too heavy on the cleansers. I'd still go back, but I think I'll bring my own spoon next time."
"2","Woke up on a Friday morning and urgently needed a pho fix.\n\nThe special combo beef pho was a no-go.\nThe soup was really oily along with a herbal taste.\n However, they have fresh coconut juice and perfect Vietnamese coffee !!\n\nUm, won't be back."
"5","Love this place! Their pho has that traditional home made Viet taste and very fast and good service. Highly recommended."
"3","Perfect Pho! Stock was seasoned just right; the meat and noodle was just the right portion. Nothing you could ask for more."
"5","Food very good ,place very clean"
"1","Beware! If you're a darker skinned person or do not fit the culture they will discriminate against you.  Waited 20 minutes fir pho that takes a few minutes to prep.  Went with my best friend and we're never going back.  I thought that we were beyond that. ...smh"
"4","This is my favorite place to go to when I'm craving for Filipino food, and I'm not quite yet ready to head home from school. \n\nI always get their 2-Item Combo since it's really cheap (around $6) for a lot of yummy food! I've tried their sinigang (ask for some soup on the side!), chicken/pork adobo, chicken & pork bbq, bistek, lumpiang shanghai, beef calderata, crispy pata, and their chicharon bulaklak. I've always left happy and full whenever I ate here or ordered food from here. The food does end up on the oily side though -- which is why this place only gets 4 stars.\n\nMy favorite here has GOT to be the crispy pata. Good for the tummy, bad for the arteries. Haha! I love eating crispy pata with just rice. Yum, yum, yum! I always bring my out-of-town peeps here! \n\nTheir place is clean and obviously their ambiance is very Filipino (duh!). I felt very \""at home\"" here and their service is always nice and friendly.\n\nDefinitely going in for some more.. And more.. And more! :)"
"5","They've changed the carpeting, fixed air vents, re-painted the walls to a really sweet color, and re-decorated the whole place.  Also, all pool tables are being re-felt.  \n\nGreat thing about this place is that the smoke smell has gone away since they fixed the air vents.  Anyway, I'm so happy that this place was given a makeover.  I love it even more!\n\nThis is how I feel about Cue D's...\n\nMaking your way in the world today \ntakes everything you've got. \nTaking a break from all your worries, \nsure would help a lot. \n\nWouldn't you like to get away? \n\nSometimes you want to go \n\nWhere everybody knows your name, \nand they're always glad you came. \nYou wanna be where you can see, \nour troubles are all the same \nYou wanna be where everybody knows \nYour name. \n\nYou wanna go where people know, \npeople are all the same, \nYou wanna go where everybody knows \nyour name. \n\nFull Lyrics never actually aired \n\nMaking your way in the world today \nTakes everything you've got; \nTaking a break from all your worries \nSure would help a lot. \nWouldn't you like to get away? \n\nAll those night when you've got no lights, \nThe check is in the mail; \nAnd your little angel \nHung the cat up by it's tail; \nAnd your third fiance didn't show; \n\nSometimes you want to go \nWhere everybody knows your name, \nAnd they're always glad you came; \nYou want to be where you can see, \nOur troubles are all the same; \nYou want to be where everybody knows your name. \n\nRoll out of bed, Mr. Coffee's dead; \nThe morning's looking bright; \nAnd your shrink ran off to Europe, \nAnd didn't even write; \nAnd your husband wants to be a girl; \n\nBe glad there's one place in the world \nWhere everybody knows your name, \nAnd they're always glad you came; \nYou want to go where people know, \nPeople are all the same; \nYou want to go where everybody knows your name. \n\nWhere everybody knows your name, \nAnd they're always glad you came; \nWhere everybody knows your name, \nAnd they're always glad you came..."
"4","Talk about throwing it back old school for me. I still remember oh about twenty years ago first moved too Vegas would frequent Shark Pool Hall with roommate go shot pool and drink after work. Times have changed with lot more pool halls across the valley. It was my first time coming too Cue-D. I really had no expectations expect keep my early yakudoshi party going night. It located in the perfect spot comes too finding some great asian food off the strip. After great night at Wendy decided too keep the party going across the street. The only downfall feel for all the shops in this little strip mall is parking suxs! It can fill up supa fast but if all else fails can park across the road then walk over. \n\nPool Hall its not Huge Huge but just overall nice size. Think something like over 15 tables in all. Not the full size regulation tables. Who need regulation really going there too drink and play pool with friends? Lol! Drinking about steal of deal. I believe from 7-10 running special two dollar beers. The catch was fact not your typical cheap flavorless ones they had few nice craft beers. Me and roommate went for the Shock Top. Really for $2 that is SHOCK of price no pun intended. The bar area itself is nothing too brag about just your basic hole in the wall feel for bar. The service is awesome. The moment walk in ask if playing pool, games or hour, many tables, and really on it. The tables for really looks like hole in wall place are really nice. The felt are nice all around or could tell on all the tables (no rips, clean, and tables are all leveled right). The house sticks most part straight not warped or abuse much being house  sticks. Each table nice table area you can place your drinks and whatever else bring, The jukebox something that cool surprise! You can play whatever music in the mood or rocking pool game on. I like the fact that the tables have nice amount of space between tables or feels like more then normal?\n\nThe only thing need too be prepared for is NO CASH. They do have ATM right next too the bar, We had too use because first timers had no clue. \n\nDefinitely fan of Cue-D. If ever have urge too go shot pool really this place rocks for bargain and love hole in the wall places in Vegas."
"1","Oh boy.... this time they really saw the last of me.... one time I waited 3 hrs for an oil change. Never went back. Today we stopped to inquire about changing our car. 600+ credit score didn't help. They came back with a ridiculous 13% APR. No deal but the leasing option was acceptable. However, we asked to FIRST see the car. They had to bring it from another dealer.... but... they wouldn't bring it unless they had a commitment from us to take it. All was cool with Monica until Mr. Big shot manager David Culp came over and loudmouthed us. So, we can't see the car unless we commit to buy it?\"" --- \""That's riiiii - iiiight\"", he said .... hahaha... who do you think you're dealing with little man? This guy is a big turnoff. We will never go back there courtesy of Mr.Culp. I know that car salesmen aren't the most courteous in the world but Culp takes the cake."
"4","This is a boutique catered mostly to designer brands, which was what brought me here. Great selection of designer shoes, I saw a classic Chanel pair and a vintage looking Louboutin pair, amongst lots of Jimmy Choo and other designer shoes in great condition, some even come in original boxes! I went in originally for designer purses and was a little disappointed by the selection. But I will definitely check back for shoes."
"1","I wanted to stop in for a long time and finally got the chance today. Mostly old lady clothes. Some priced higher than when they were new. And most of the \""couture\"" has made in China labels. But to each their own. The reason I'm rating it so low is the staff. The two women were condescending and rude at best. They continued conversations amongst themselves without ever offering to help me. They kept an eye on me like they thought I was gonna take something. But the only times they actually spoke to me were to tell me they close in 15 minutes when I entered and to tell me they will close in 5 minutes which is when I left ... Without bothering to purchase the dress I picked out for my mother."
"4","Great Argentine food in Vegas!\n\nRincon has my favorite sandwich of all time!  The Lomito Completo!\n\nThey also do great steaks and sausage.  They have good salads, empanadas, and incredible chimichurri sauce--the best thing you've ever poured on a sandwich, portioned on a bite of steak, and dunked your fries into (all-in-one sauce!)\n\nThe atmosphere can leave something to be desired...it's not bad, just casual and a little like a small cafeteria.  Service is usually good, but has been off when crowded on more than one occasion."
"2","Everytime my family and I went to Las Vegas we'd go to this restaurant cos there weren't many good Argentine places near us. But whatever good it used to be is fading fast. My parents got asado and even though it was a little pink despite asking for it well done it was decent. The mollejas were good, the chimichurri was great, the bread seemed to be heated up in a microwave and was soft. The ricotta ravioles I got were hard and pretty bad, I couldn't even finish the plate. The masa of the empanadas were kinda doughy and unpleasant. The day I went there were three women working. One waitress was sweet, the other was... Just having a bad day I guess. \nI didn't get a refill on my drink til I was done eating, and I can understand that when you're busy you forget but come on, they checked on us twice throughout the whole meal. If you want something be sure to shout for it. \nOverall if you just want argentine cuisine for a decent price and aren't expecting a 4 star meal this is the place for you. I used to really love this place so I'm hoping they just had a bad day and will get back on track but as of right now I'm not planning to stop by next time I'm in town."
"5","I could not have been more pleased with my experience here. They are fast, prompt, and extremely thorough. Make sure you ask for Taylor as your hygienist. She was absolutely amazing and you can tell she has a passion for her career."
"1","DONT EVER COME HERE. this place is a joke.  I was in search of a nail place that did fancy nail art and thought I was at the right place, considering the fact that they had a bunch of displays of their work which easily attracted me.  Ive only had white tips done before, and never anything crazy, so i was really excited to have \""blinged out\"" nails.\n\nIt began with a pedicure, which as he  completed it, it looked like a 5 year old had done my toe nails.  I figured, \""ok... well... at least i can wear shoes to cover them.\"" after that, we went to start my mani. He started to put white tips on my nails and i specifically asked him, \""With those white tips, am i able to choose a design that I want?\"" he responded \""YES, any design. after im done, choose a design and color.\"" ..... and so I did. WHen i chose the nail design i wanted, he said  he couldnt do it!! i was so upset, and told him i wasnt happy with just white tips... and that wasnt what i asked for. I asked him if I was able to choose any design i wanted! and the one i did he said it was impossible because i should have told him i wanted a powdered glitter, how the hell was i suppose to know that??? im now a NAIL GURU, i didnt know i had to specifically  ask him to mis the glitter in my acrilic powder!... I mean i understand he didnt speak english, but damn seriously??? How can u run a business off of customer service if you cant understand your customers???\n\nI looked at my nails, and they were disgusting looking... they were uneven.... and horrible.   IF I WANTED WHITE TIPS, I WOULD ASK FOR THEM.... thats how he left them! and expected me to pay FULL PRICE for something I didnt want! I asked for at least 5-10 dollars off to compensate the trouble of not getting what I wanted... and what does he do??  GOES UP TO THE DOOR, LOCKS IT AND SCREAMS AT ME SAYING GIVE ME MY MONEEY!!!!! you just want it for free!\""  what a FREAK!!!!!! i told him its NOT ABOUT the money!!! I would pay even $50 for my nails IF it was worth it but this was far from it!!! I make a great deal of income, how dare he insist I was there for a free-bee!!! i gave him my money and left that MAD HOUSE!!!!! \n\n\nTHESE PEOPLE ARE CRAZY, STAYYYYYYY AWAY AT UR OWN RISK! HE WILL LOCK YOU IN THERE AND KEEP YOU HOSTAGE IF YOU DONT LIKE HIS WORK!! AND TRUST HIS NAIL ART IS PURE CRAP!"
"5","Thank you to Jessy for a tattoo I have had a ton of compliments on!\n\nI made an appointment but they also take walk ins.\n\nArtists that weren't tattooing were sketching, painting, or drawing.\n\nI got custom work done, she drew it up on my arm to get the right fit and I am looking forward to working with her in the future on the rest of it! I can tell her mind is brewing something up for me.\n\nCheck out their website for all of the artist's portfolios...every artist is there on the website so you can check out their work before you go.\nThe pricing is extremely reasonable for the quality of the work."
"4","Yes, this is cheap buffet food but it's great for lunches and Friday night dinners. Why? For the selection of food for lunch, where else can the best bang for your buck? There is a great selection of sushi, beef, shrimp, frog legs, and ox tail soup. For me, that's all good enough for something under $10. As for Friday night dinner, there is lobster and crab legs and crawfish here. Now, the lobster is pretty good. The crab legs and crawfish is mediocore. This place is always packed and seats a lot of people. It has the main room and 3 other separate rooms. Why does it get such low reviews from some people, I'm not sure. Did you expect to pay under $10 and get Bellgio or Wynn buffet quality?"
"1","I went to Buffet at Asia on at 3:30pm dinner realize that dinner starts at 4:00pm, I only paid for lunch, the waitresses come to my table at least 8 times to see if I was eating any crab legs, however never offered me a refill on my drink...Poor service."
"1","I have been to this buffet once a few years ago when I first moved to Vegas. I wasnt that impressed with their food. Considering its not hard to like Asian food. I havent been back since then. Today, my wife and I were so hungry, wanted something quick and didnt have to wait for the food. I wanted to give this place another shot considering theyre still in business. They must have gotten better. WRONG! Not only was their food disappointing, it was worse than I remember & the \""other\"" room in the back right corner had this awful musty smell. It was like a combination of a porta potty & a senior home living. The whole experience was just horrible. I barely ate. Couldnt stand being in the place that long. If you have any thoughts of going here, dont even bother. There are better local buffets that will cost you the same but way better."
"2","The food was mediocre. the selection was very limited. my husband thought it was good,is why I gave it 2 stars. The squid was rubbery. the egg drop soup was barely warm and had corn it. Yuck!!"
"3","Decent enough buffet with the typical findings. Not a very large selections, or it doesn't feel like it has a large one. There's some more specialty items here like a larger sushi bar, fresh stirfry, sometimes tritip, and tempura. And there are the typical asian buffet fair.\n\nOne star off for bad service--half the time the servers flounder. And the building layout sucks.\nAnother star off for some of their food is just lacking, or seems a bit \""watered down\"". \n\nI like to go here when I get tired of other asian buffets in the area. Try coming here as it opens as the food is fresher and sometimes there's dishes that are only laid out once. If you don't want to take the risk, try Krazy Buffet up the road."
"3","I always pass this boutique on the way to work, so I decided to stop by one day.\n\nI noticed that my bras were getting too small and I remembered the golden rule on the show \""What not to wear\"" Make sure \""The girls are where they're supposed to be\""...\n\nWhen I first walked into the store I wasn't that impressed, It just seemed like an old store from the 70's w/ ill-fitted discounted lingerie on special.  It wasn't until I asked the lady in the back if I could get fitted, and then she started pulling out the good stuff...\n\nAfter I was fitted I tried on the correct bra size and ahhh, the world IS a better place when the \""girls\"" are where they belong!"
"1","I have had 2 problems with this location 2 years in a row. The first one they made the cake smaller than it should have been and when I told the owner about it she acted so rude and suggested I was lying. The next year they messed up my daughters birthday cake. I ordered chocolate chip ice cream and the chips everyone realized was cheap generic ice cream that you would buy at the store in those big gallon tubs. The only saving grace was the good decoration."
"1","i had an appt for cataract surgery and my daughter already had purchased the plane tickets when, out of the blue, Dr Westfield announced he was changing his days of doing surgery.  THAT REALLY SUCKED!   Never was even notified of this change and they lied and said they tried to reach me,  Found out when i got my preoperative exam.  When i finally got the surgery, the lens was placed in the wrong spot and i now have ghost images in that eye that Dr westfield says it would be dangerous to try to fix.  STAY AWAY!"
"2","Poor customer service in Spanish AND English. You just can't legislate or regulate against stupidity. It is hard to manage a franchise operation, I know. But with unemployment hovering at ten percent, I think this Popeye's can do better.\n\nThe chicken I'm not interested in fueling a brand loyalty debate. It is what it is. Spitefully overpriced, but each to his own as I prefer the flavor of the spicy. But bad customer service in today's economy is UNFORGIVABLE. \n\nI'm not talking about someone who can't speak in a language I understand (because they didn't realize it ... but I speak all languages spoken at this particular Popeye's) and I'm not talking about someone having a bad day at the register. I'm talking about shameful, rude, arrogance beyond comparison.\n\nNo...I will never go back to this ghetto excuse for a Popeye's.  This chain restaurant franchise has earned my \""Restaurant Most Deserving of Implosion\"" award for this year. There is no excuse for the racism displayed by these people, and no excuse for the clowning around behind the counter in view of the customers whom you attach nicknames to. Evil, evil people.\n\nGrr."

"1","This is the absolute worst Pizza Hut I have ever been to. Extremely rude employees, and an extremely rude manager. After delivering the pizza to the wrong home, they offered to remake it for me, but only after I had called and complained that it was taking over an hour to deliver. It then took another HOUR to get my brand new pizza. I called the manager and requested a refund. I went down to the store and the manager made rude remarks, and rolled his eyes at me several times during our \""conversation\"", then only to shut down and throw me refund receipt and debit card at me for me to take and sign. Absolutely the worst Pizza Hut I have ever dealt with."
"5","This service is great! I don't trust anyone with my son but I felt comfortable using this company. Olivia was our nanny for the evening and I think she did a fantastic job and was very attentive. Sarah, the owner is one of the nicest people out there :)"
"5","I have been studying with Sifu Baugh since 2003.  My only complaint is that I didn't find him before 2003.  I have been studying since the 80's, and I have studied with some disreputable teachers.  Sifu teaches: Chen Tai Chi, Yang Tai Chi, Northern and Southern forms of Kung Fu, Praying Mantis, Xing Yi, Ba Qua, and other forms of traditional Kung Fu.  Unlike other teachers and schools I have attended, Sifu Baugh is approachable and humble.  He teaches the majority of the classes, and his only concern is helping you to get better.  He is respected by other martial arts teachers in town, and he even teaches some of them. \n\nIf you are looking for a traditional Kung Fu school with: experienced and qualified instructors, reasonable monthly fees, no annual contracts, many different styles and classes, no ego, and a place that you can train for the rest of your life, then this is the place to train."
"5","Dr Arnold is a no-nonsense professional. His staff are always friendly and courteous. I would highly recommend him."
"1","No air conditioner! We all sweated as we ate, it's an oven in here!! Worst mc Donald and dinning experience of the summer. How can you have the dinning room open when you have no air and it's over 100 degrees"
"2","It feels weird reviewing a McDonalds again, but here we go anyway. Unfortunately I've only had the pleasure of visiting this location after hours and have had different experiences each time. \n\nSometimes they allow me to order select breakfast items off of their 24 hour breakfast menu, and sometimes they don't. \n\nSometimes they allow me to pay with my debit card and sometimes they don't.\n\nSometimes the drive thru is open and sometimes the entire restaurant is closed with no warning save for traffic cones blocking the drive thru.\n\nIn case you haven't noticed a pattern, this is the most inconsistent fast food joint I've hit up. And if you do end up ordering some food late at night,  be prepared to take a mini siesta in your car while you wait for your food order."
"1","My coworker got us lunch from this branch and were disgusted with the quality of their fries. We got 4 combos and NONE of us were able to eat it. Sadly we couldn't return them because we had to get back to work DISAPPOINTED because we didn't get to enjoy our fries since they were old/oily/stale/ and plain gross! \n\nOn a separate visit, I asked the drive though cashier for ketchup and was told that \""we are all out\"" when there was a whole bunch on their counter! I mean, seriously???? \n\nZERO STARS, go to a different mcdonalds!"
"1","I wanted to like this place. I pulled up and was underwhelmed by the appearance of the outside but decided to give it a shot anyway. First, when I initially called and made an appointment they told me it was a $10 charge for gel polish. When I got there, they told me it was an extra $20 for gel polish. $20 extra dollars for some nail polish under a UV light? No. So I decided to get just the regular 30 minute manicure and 30 minute pedicure. \n\nMy manicure lasted a measly 15 minutes. And the pedicure was the worst I have ever had. That is saying a lot considering I get pedicures every 2 weeks and have done so for the last 10 years. My toenails look like they were painted by my 3 year. Honestly, my two week old pedicure from before looked better than what I have on my nails right now. In addition to that, the pedicure chairs do not recline and do not have massage. Maybe fine normally, but I am 8 months pregnant and I had to sit uncomfortably for the duration of the pedicure because the chairs do not adjust at all. \n\nI came here because I had a Spa Finder gift card and my regular nail place doesn't accept them. Highly disappointed and now I have to go get my toes redone because they look like utter crap and I can't reach them myself."
"2","I went with 4 other girls here for a massage.  3 of us had the spa samplers.  I chose the facial (extra $10), foot massage, hand/foot scrub, and scalp/shoulders massage.  The lady I had was super friendly, however, the facial was ok.   the foot massage was even worse.   Mostly, rubbing up and down my legs not much pressure at all on my tired feet.  My hair was so greasy after the scalp massage because of the massage oil that I had to wash my hair before leaving salon.  Overall, price is too good to be true."
"4","Came for the awesome shakes & fries. We usta come here sit at the front window & watch cars & ppl. But there were too many transient ppl here slummin & loitering. Came here today tables clean, quiet, organized & helpful. I ordered the vanilla shake real thick & flavorful. Gson got the strawberry shake he could barely get the thick ice cream through the straw. The fries were crispy on the outside yummy on the inside."
"1","Puke Palace!!!\n\nAdvisory: This location ONLY!\n\nI use to come here on my lunch breaks because it was right next to where I used to work. I would walk here almost once a week...JUST FOR CONVENIENCE! We only got a half hour lunch so I had to go somewhere close and the only other option was Mc Donald's and I'm not a big fan! \n\nSo hmmm where do I begin? Yes its that bad! \n\nOk the 1st time I came here I ordered a bacon cheese burger combo which after tax was like $8.00bucks!!!...OMG it took 20 minutes for me to get my order which meant I had to scarf this nasty sickening burger down in 5 mins because I still had to walk back to work and clock in! \n\nNot to mention on top of it taking forever to cook it was under cooked I saw it was rare pink!!! I was so pissed off and had no time to complain I just ate the thing and left to work. \n\nI tried this place a few more times only because I didn't have time to eat anywhere else. \n\nThe second time I ate here I tried there chicken strips. UMMM they were tasty but had blue dots streaming through them...not sure what that was but hey I'm still living! \n\nAfter trying various items I came to realize the only tasty and safe thing to order was their chili cheese fries which after tax came to almost 6 bucks for a large. \n\nLuckily I do not nearby anymore and will NOT be returning! \n\n*NASTY FOOD \n*OVER PRICED \n*DIRTY AND FILTHY DINE IN \n*DRUGGED OUT EMPLOYEES \n\nPS: The employees are ALL NASTY and DRUGGED OUT!!! \n\nI witnessed an employee with dirty finger nails. Also no washing of hands or gloves while touching raw and cooked food. This location seems more of a health department issue than anything else. \n\nPlease if you can avoid eating at THIS Dairy Queen Please avoid it! at all costs!"
"1","This place is the definition of repugnant. I understand when a mistake happens once or twice when it is busy, but I have gone here multiple times and during those multiple times, my order and the service have been not at it's best. For example, I have ordered fries and they told me it was going to be a few minutes because they make everything fresh, but when I got the fries, they were cold and undercooked. Secondly, when I order a blizzard, the amount of toppings in very light. Thirdly, filthy filthy filthy. I am not surprised that I saw a C rating in their lobby. Overall, I will no longer go out of my way to this place is to eat."
"5","We have been here several times. It is always clean and everyone is very friendly. Sandra is a master colorist and hairstylist.  Not to mention gives THE BEST scalp massages! I can't imagine anyone else ever touching my hair again! Definitely ask for Sandra!  She is awesome! :-)"
"1","Walk in on sat. Nobody was up front and nobody helped me. So I walked out. Do not go there."
"1","Tuesday night sweet tooth went unsatisfied as we started to order some frozen desserts.  Only to be shot down with, \""I'm sorry but we're out of ice cream tonight\"". WHAT?  Are you kidding me?  Plenty of other spots to go for dessert and we will not be coming back here."
"2","I had been craving a milkshake from sonic for weeks, I finally went and got one today! The guy didn't put the lid on all the way, MILK SHAKE EVERYWHERE!!!! All the guy did was offer more napkins! Half of my milkshake spilled out. I even paid more to get extra pie crust in the shake...I et to work to get and my order is completely wrong! It's not brain surgery people!!!!"
"4","Good honest sushi from Hawaii. Sushi Yamaguchi was one of the only sushi places in Vegas that have been to where they actually seasoned their edamame. One of the more memorable rolls I had was called the Black Fire roll, eel, and cream cheese inside with spicy tuna outside. Garnished with scallions and eel sauce. A great combination of sweet and spicy, crunchy and creamy. The roll itself was enough to almost fill me up. The restaurant sees a good number of regulars during the lunch hours."
"3","Good sushi place, prices are reasonable.  Nothing outstanding, but it a good place to go and I will be going back again.  The service was outstanding, although I did go at lunch and there were not many people there."
"3","Not bad... the Restaurant.com coupon helped make this 2 star restaurant into a 3-star."
"1","My wife and I are expecting our second child.  We have actually been here a couple of times.  It certainly is a boutique with some expensive strollers that you usually see movie stars carting their little ones in.  We went over the president's day weekend.  We went there for a specific product.  My wife wanted to get an  Ergo baby carrier for our daughter now and the new baby coming.  So I stayed back and with our daughter and we were looking a some comfy chairs.  My wife was on a mission and knew what she was looking for.  She found the Ergo in the back of store and then came and got us so we could all try it on and see if it was going to work.  We spent a good 45 minutes, both of us trying it on with our daughter fighting us the whole way.  In the mean time I couldn't help but notice this other couple that was being helped about the same time we walked in.  I overheard them talking about baby monitors and they were wondering if the range would be sufficient because their home was over 5000 square feet.  This associate was at their feet helping them.  At the end we finished with the Ergo and I asked my wife did anyone ever offer you any help since we walked in?  She said no, and on the way out we saw several associates just hanging out.  It was very obvious to me that this terrible establishment caters to a certain demographic here in Las Vegas.  Please don't waste your time in this pretentious store.  Everything they offer can be purchased online and in some cases Babies R Us.  Apparently visually we didn't meet the standards required to get the right amount of service from this sales staff.  This is one local business that doesn't want our money and will never get it! It is a shame because we were ready to purchase this item from them and we decided to pass.  Just a hello would of saved our business."
"2","Close to my house so I checked it out again. Maybe 3 ppl plus a very in attentive bar tender (dare I call him that). More interested in goofing on his iPad than trying to provide any kind of service. I quickly dropped $45, practically had to beg to get a beer. I'll pay for the beer, just actually pay attention.\n\nProlly try it in a few months but I doubt anything will change. Hasn't in over a year. No wonder it's empty at 1am"
"5","I have been going here like 3 years.  Lani is the best her pedicures always last forever and everyone always compliments my nails and pedicures."
"4","My favorite neighborhood bars. Great drink prices, the machines are loose, and there is always a few cute smiles working.\nPizzas are really good and half off on saturdays. \nFirst impressions from the outside is that the bar is old and small but when you get inside it has a nice neighborhood bar feeling. Like the show Cheers.  They have a restaurant area and a bar. They have an abundance of flat screens for the games and they will even change the channel for you for your favorite team. They have a large banquet area that tends to be busy all the time with different car groups and receptions. \nI really like the Fellini's pizza. The bread is homemade and the cheese is delicious. The tacos on Tuesday are really good too. They are american style but they hit the spot. \n\nFYI\nI have seen families there with the kids after sport games so I guess its a kid friendly restaurant."
"2","Fatburger wouldn't be my first choice for lunch.  First of all, the burger is kind of expensive.  Secondly, it's not that great.  Although, it looks delicious.  \n\nWhen I went in all I wanted was a cheeseburger with the works.  I felt like I was signing up for life insurance.  They kept bombarding me questions.  Just do it right and stop making things so complicated.  It's supposed to be fast food."
"5","Still working my way through the menu, but everything so far has been great. The knots are unbeatable and the pizza is pretty \""close\"", if you know what I mean. Plus, they are definitely from NY, so they know what they're doing in there! I can't wait to try the Sicilian, which I haven't had since I lived in Queens (five years ago!). I always get sausage on my thin-crust and it's actually sliced thin, not little crumbles. So good. The mini pie with two toppings for $7 and change is more than enough for me. \n\nAre they the friendliest bunch? Not always, but do you really care? I may be showing my New York, but just give me my pizza and send me on my way. This is a hole-in-the-wall mostly meant for takeout or delivery, not a five-star steakhouse. Come for the pizza, not the freaking ambiance.\n\nI'd recommend picking up a copy of the menu and calling in your order. For one, there's a $1 delivery fee through Eat24 while their printed menu says it's free. I've only ever paid for a delivery when ordering online, so keep it in mind. Also, when ordering online, sometimes special instructions/substitutions don't print out correctly on their end."
"4","I normally don't comment on service because that always varies depending on who you get, but I must say that our waitress was amazing. She seemed to be the only one working the whole restaurant, but I didn't notice. My drink was never more than half empty and she was working her butt off! Extra star just for her.\n\nA little local sports bar with a pretty extensive menus- dinner entrees, salads, burgers, sandwiches, appetizers, etc. I was only expecting pub dishes when we saw this place, but we were pleasantly surprised. My husband and I both ordered the Western burger. Overall solid burger- the patty itself was a little under seasoned, but the BBQ sauce had a good flavor and I enjoyed every bite.  \nHad the Frings on the side- fries and onion rings and they were delicious. Everything was crispy and well seasoned. \n\nGreat little joint to stop in to watch the game and have a well cooked meal. Great selection for a bar."
"5","Fixed my locks, was on time and reasonably priced. I was pleased with the service and the tech did not try to sell me on unnecessary extras."
"1","I don't need to go back to a smith that refuses to sell pins to a do-it-yourselfer that needs to re-key new doorlocks to older keys.  I will not return to have keys duplicated at this joint nor will I consider them should I need a safe.  This business approach is extremely myopic when one considers how uncommonly a customer will want to re-pin his/her own locks.  \n\nAn employee had to tell me, \""We don't do that,\"" after consulting the decision maker, who sat on his long suffering chair and refused to walk 8 steps to the counter to explain.\n\nFor what it's worth, the locksmith in my homwtown GIVES me the pins I need, and I returned to pay for duplicate keys, difficult re-pins and lock-outs.  I also recommend their services to friends.\n\nTwo way street.  Give and take.\n\nLiberty/Stanley just wants to take."
"4","I'm neither of Italian parentage nor from an area with a large cultural population from the old country, so I can't speak to the true authenticity of Roma's. What I can say is I enjoyed my food immensely and the waitstaff was extremely cordial. I can understand why a small business may need to charge more to cover their expenses, though if I'm getting a basic pasta-and-sauce entree I would hope they consider making something that simple a little less costly. That's really my only complaint; this place is great and I will be stopping by for dinner again the next time I have an extended stay in Vegas."
"2","For the past two Sundays, I've come here to hang out for a couple of hours while my Son is at a Church function.  I enjoy watching the Sunday night football game here and enjoying a drink or two.  Last night I decided to grab a bite to eat.\n\nI was dining by myself and wanted some finger food.  After browsing the menu for a few minutes, I decided to go with the Nachos ($10.50).  To wash it down, I had an Iced Tea.\n\nI watched the Giants/Bears game while I waited for my grub......it didn't take too long before it came....the waitress delivered the Nachos and they were a friggin' mountain of Nachos!  (see pics) Seriously.....I'm not opposed to large portions, but damn this thing could easily feed 4 people!  I was a little pissed because I didn't want to eat that much and the waitress didn't say anything.....also the menu didn't mention the gargantuan size of the Nachos either.  I reacted by saying \""Damn, that's a friggin' mountain of food!\"".....she replied \""I know\""......well if you knew, why didn't you say something when I ordered it?!\n\nThis is where I am torn....do I knock off a Star because of this?  or not?  I personally feel that it's the server's responsibility to inform customers of stuff like this....especially when they see someone is dining alone and portion size is not mentioned on the menu.\n\nBack to the food....the Nachos were topped with melted Cheddar Cheese, Jalapenos, Guacamole, Sour Cream, Onions, Olives, Tomatoes.  The thing was so massive that stuff was falling off the edges of plate....another faux pas from the server is that she didn't offer me a smaller plate to eat my Nachos.....she expected me to pull pieces off this mountain and have it fall all over the table like a pig.  I tried for a few minutes but felt like a slob so I asked her for a plate, which she brought over right away.\n\nThe Nachos flavor wasn't spectacular, it was bleh.  The Cheese wasn't gooey....it was melted, but seemed to be sitting a little while because it was already coagulating and it was difficult to eat the Nachos without using a fork.  Also, it was top heavy with the toppings....meaning after the 1st layer of Nachos, there was nothing but bare chips in the lower sections.  What's the point of this dish then?  I don't know.....I felt bad because I didn't even come close to finishing it and it wasn't worth taking home......what a waste of food.\n\nI took off 1 Star because of the bad service.....still a great place to catch a game.  I've eaten here many times in the past with great experiences, but was an inactive Yelper at the time so those experiences are outdated.\n\nWill I return?  Because of my favorable history with Big Dog's, I will give them another chance.....next time I'm asking the server how large the portion is."
"3","Very sad to say that the bar was sold to a slot parlor & will be closing before New Years. The staff was good & so was the food. To many stupid slot parlors in this town now!"
"2","Growing up in high school, my friend Julia used to just rave about this place.  She swore the curry puffs were the best thing she'd ever put in her mouth.  She lived all the way across the city, though, so I never had the chance to sample it.  The last time she was in town, I went with her family.  I would have been less than impressed anyway, but it truly paled because I was expecting something spectacular both from her raves and the various awards it's received over the years.\n\nThe curry puffs were OK, but nothing great.  The rest of the dishes seemed like something I could get at any Chinese restaurant without the price tag that Cathay House put on them.  The feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best.\n\nThe food wasn't bad, but the value wasn't there.  Wish I could have tried it 10 years ago."
"2","This is one of the worst dim-sum spots I've ever been too. I remember coming here over a decade ago and it ruined our stay weekend in Vegas cause my whole family and I were bathroom-ridden for the rest of the day, bound by the aches of our tummies denying to effectively digest the stuff.\n\nA decade later, I opted to give it one more chance. After all, if they're around after all this time and still standing, why not? Plus, my niece  couldn't get through a casino (I like Ping-Pang-Pong's dimsum), and my brother wanted dimsum soooo Round 2. We made it happen.\n \nThis place did NOT make it happen. Shoulda took the hint when the only people who were chinese were the staff. Everything was too salty, tasted too old, or wasn't steaming. \n\nI don't want to get into it... Cause it gets gross from here, but I'll say that those 2-stars go out to the convenience and speed of the place... Because it's pretty empty."
"2","Been going to this restaurant for years.  The quality goes up and down.  Last Saturday however, we learned that they charge $1 per person for tea.     I don't even drink tea.  I order soda.  They don't even ask you if you want tea they just serve it.  I asked them how they figure who is and who isn't drinking the tea.  They could not give me an answer.  So before you order and they bring you that tea you better make sure you want it and you tell them who are the people who are going to be drinking it."
"2","I was craving dim sum late night, and this was the only place that was open. Since I've been craving dim sum for a few months now, this place got lucky that I devoured everything in front of me. The bad news, I got food poisoning. I knew there was something wrong with the pork shumai when it reeked of bad pork and the cavier on top was still gooey on top, but I was beyond hungry and going through one of my cravings so I forged ahead. There is a limited dim sum menu for night time. Here is the breakdown: Edible and decent: sweet custard buns and shrimp balls. Reminiscent of dim sum: banana leaf sticky rice, shrimp potstickers and pork buns. Either bland or bad: pork shumai and shark fin potstickers. I heard there are much better places to go for dim sum in Vegas...so don't go here for it, unless it's really late and you are beyond crave monster status. FYI - I saw a family order 7 orders of fried rice...maybe that is what I should have ordered...."
"3","This is the place to go for Dim Sum. During certain times they have carts that make rounds around the restaurant so you can just pick off what you want.\n\nThe food is pretty delicious. Every time I come here I'm not disappointed. My favorites are -- Shrimp wontons & shrimp balls. They serve it with a mayo dipping sauce that is to die for when combined! We also ordered crab in this ginger garlic sauce which had a lot of flavor. \n\nI gave them 3 stars because I could have taken a nap & the food would have not arrived yet! Even our wonton soup took forever to come out. We were starving! & today we had ordered deep fried chicken and they forgot it when we clearly ordered it. And funny thing was the waiter recited our order back to us after we had ordered our food. \n\nOverall, I'll come back here but probably will call to pick up food instead of dine in."
"1","They microwaved our dim sum in front of us. Depressing. Nothing more to stay."
"4","I was craving some Dim sum and this place was in the area we were at. To be honest these place are all pretty much the same. It just comes down to the food and that's where this place delivers. Everything we tried we liked. I'm not an expert on dim sum so I cant comment on each dish individually. We really liked everything. The servers were really nice too. I've been to other places where the servers aren't friendly so that is a plus in my book. So give them a try."
"4","What the hell... Drove there today and they were closed?!?! The sign over the restaurant was taken down... So confused and sad, this was my spot!!!! I hope it's just temporary for construction. Anyone have any insight?"
"5","These guys are AWESOME! Our AC unit at our home took a dump and I called around to four different places in Las Vegas, these guys were the only ones who could make it over the same day to troubleshoot our problem. I had a breaker for the AC that would not reset properly. They came out later that night and shot down the unit. It's old, from 1999. They could have replaced the unit that night but I needed to get ahold of our landlord to approve the maintenance. The very next day I was able to have Dekes come out and replace the broken AC unit. They were able to direct bill our landlord and required no money from us(besides the initial visit for troubleshooting). My wife was also pleased by their professionalism and great work. These guys are great and I would recommend them to anyone else in the Las Vegas area!! Thanks again Dekes Refrigeration & Air Conditioning!!! Our house is cooling nice again, just like new!!!"
"1","This office is good for very basic stuff - very basic.  I brought my pet in because  something was not right and the doctor said it was just a reaction to something (and basically didn't know anything else to do).  I don't know why I didn't get a second opinion.  Two months later my pet died.  I really liked this office at first, but after the lack of action and knowledge (or even suggesting they didn't know what to do to see someone else) I won't be returning."
"2","This is the only place to get Schlotzsky's so regardless of the lackluster dining experience  - I will be back.\n\nI love the original.  The warm sourdough type bread with the warm ham... mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm good. \n\nThis place is old and run down.  The service sucks.  But if you want some Schlotzcky's this is it!"
"3","I have to admit, the only thing that makes this place good is their interesting looking bread, which is unique in appearance and texture and is delicious. Other than that, the sandwiches are pretty plain and expensive for what you get ($5-6 for a small sandwich). \n\nThe service here is pretty lackluster, since there are only a couple people working at any given time. When I've been here, I've found the cashier to be a little impatient when customers are trying to figure out what to order, so now I tend to just hit the drive thru. \n\nThe building is super old and parking is tight since there aren't very many spots out front. There's another small parking area in the back but it's not much larger. I usually get the small original, which is good, but like I said...only because the bread is unique, fresh and tasty. If they used baugettes or \""normal\"" sub bread for their sandwiches, I don't think I would eat here."
"5","Sandwiches are great and I've had really nice customer service each time I've visited."
"3","My 100th review is a tribute to \""street food\"" - Tacos El Compita is in a strip center, and was fast and authentic.  We were limited on cash (forgot it was cash only in other reviews), but scraped together enough for a 5-taco plate (I got the juicy tongue/lengua, and the boy had 2 beef, 1 carnitas and 1 pollo), a side of sliced avocado, and 1 Mexican coke (bf only drinks h2o).  The food was fast, the salsa bar very nice (radishes, whole raw jalepenos, pico, onions and cilantro, very spicy salsas - loved the green especially).  The tacos had onions and salsa on them, and my poor bf doesn't do spicy food too well, so he got the avocado to cool him down while I was dipping it in the green sauce!\n\nThis place is cheap and yummy, a solid bet.  I would definitely return when I have cash.  The salsa bar had cups with lids so if we hadn't been on our way to Popcorn Girl, I would've taken some green salsa home!  I ate only one taco due to our limited budget and the bf's big appetite, but next time I may try a torta (highly recommended by the lady in front of us).  The guy sitting right behind me was selling pirated CDs and peliculas :)  No one seemed to bite every time they walked in and he called CDs! Peliculas!  CDs! Peliculas!\n\nThe best part was watching my bf go to his car to get change and count out quarters and dimes to buy me the Mexican coke :)"
"3","For me this is authentic Mexican fast food, but then I am a white girl from the Midwest. Every so often I get a craving for Tacos El Compita. My husband and I make the trek there and order so much food - several tacos, a quesadilla, a huge torta, etc. It is so good. And then I ultimately get sick a few hours after I eat. I swear I won't go there again until a month later when I get the craving again."
"4","never been in this place but the drive-thru is very fast & the service is friendly & helpgul(english-speaking). this is the only place for a good gyro in las vegas. some higher priced places try but nothing comes close to the one's @ gyrotime. good cheap eats. baklava is delicious too & cheap!!"
"3","Good for a fast health food alternative than burger king. Busy with people and got my food out fast."
"5","Sure - it looks like its better days are behind it.  But the work is great!\n\nThey care a lot and spend quite a bit of time getting it right.  I am quite particular.  \n\nEverything gets wiped down.  It's the third time I've been here. \n\nI'll definitely be back."
"1","BEST CAR WASH EVER!!!!!!\n\nMake sure you ask for the \""Manager's Special!!!!\""\n\nThat's where he ashes his cigarette on your car right in front of the cops, that you called, because his (and these are his exact words) \""Professionally Trained Car Wash Technicians\"" make a dug-through-the-clearcoat-and-the-paint ring of scratches around a half-cleaned bird poop. Then he won't rectify the situation because you tarnished his business by calling the police, that he told you to call, and that's after he calls you a liar. \n\nIt's hard to find that great of a level of customer service anymore, and let me tell you, they've got it here!!!"
"2","I was very disappointed with my recent service. I realized it was busy and was told it would take 40 minutes, no worries, but when I noticed they 'mark' your car with a white marker - it is to tell the workers what level of service you paid for which determines your place in line.  After waiting 1 hour, 20 minutes and seeing  many others who came after me had come and gone, I was not happy.  I mentioned to the service person what happened and he did not deny it and said he was sorry. I will not longer spend my lunch hour at this place!"
"5","I love Farm Basket! They seriously have the best fast food fried chicken. I tried this place about a year ago because I had a groupon and I keep coming back. I usually get the fried chicken dinner with roles, mashed potatoes, and French fries but today when we went through the drive thru. I ordered the chicken fingers meal. Omg it was amazing! Crispy chicken strips, juicy not greasy and it was all white meat chicken. The honey mustard sauce was awesome as well. I also ordered for the first time there cheesy fries. They were so good I didn't want to share! Shoe string French fries with gravy and cheese. I was in carb heaven! And I'm usually not a gravy person. This place is amazing I would recommend to go here when you're having a craving for fried chicken."
"2","I strongly recommend the Farm Fries, a basket of thin-cut (McDonald's style) fries bathed in gravy (turkey?) and melted yellow shredded cheese. The richness of the gravy was on point and not overwhelming. It was a savory, calorie-laden treat. \nI read a review that the Gobbler was right up there with a Bobbie (my most favorite sandwich). After having one on this visit, I must disagree. The hunk of fried turkey was cooked well. Did I enjoy the flavor? Not really. I didn't detect any seasoning in the batter. The bun was smaller than I expected for a $5.99 price tag. I also fail to see the point of not dressing the sandwich. The cranberry and Miracle Whip would be better served on the Gobbler rather than in packets on the side. \nFarm Basket, I gave you a whirl, I enjoyed your fries but I'm sticking with Capriotti's for my turkey sandwiches."
"1","This place suceeds in spite of itself. \n\nIt has a great location, and an appealing look. I wish I could say the same about the food. I agree with Jamie P's review; the food is not quality. \n\nIf you're in the mood for this type of food, and don't feel like driving 90 miles to the nearest Chic Fil A, then settle for Raising Caine. You'll at least get hot food, quality fries, and a friendly attitude. \n\nI am done with this; one and out."
"2","I used to LOVE this place. I mean \""go there several times a week\"" kind of love but lately it seems deals have decreased as well as portion sizes. I was addicted to their wings and would stock up on them regularly. The sad little party wings they serve now (For the same price mind you!) are actually kind of insulting."
"3","I love Mark and Mercedes.   l love the music.  The one thing that is like nails down a chalkboard for me is hearing Sabrina talk.  She has a nasal problem, like most of her words come out through her nose.  I can't understand how she got this gig in radio????  I have to change the station every time she comes on.  It's sad, because it's my favorite station for the music."
"4","What a great place to spend an hour just day dreaming. They have RC Planes,Boats,cars,trucks, trainsand everything RC plus they help you work on your stuff and usually people are gathered outside toying around with their RC toy. So few of these model & Hobby store around anymore we are blessed to have 2 in the neighborhood."
"4","A quaint little store for the kid in all of us! \n\nWe stopped in to do some shopping.  There are model trains, planes and automobiles! A huge variety of every kind.   We had the pleasure of dealing with Brad.   He was so knowledgeable and helpful or our shopping that day.   I didn't realize that fun little gadgets can get to be pricey.  It was certainly an eye opener but Brad was great to deal with.   \n\nThe store is filled with many different items from floor to ceiling.  It's almost overwhelming in a small space.   Sometimes you may feel claustrophobic but you can definitely find what you need.\n\nThe associates in the store are fantastic.   From browsing to purchasing, they were all very helpful and friendly.  We are now introduced to a fun new hobby!~"
"1","This store was close which is the only reason I ever went.  Thank goodness I recently moved and there is one closer with a much better staff.  However, this one....avoid if you can.  The staff is RUDE and like to chatter when there are customers in the store instead of helping them.  I lived down the street for five years so this isn't just a one time experience.  It happened almost every time.  The last few months there was one young girl (I can't remember her name, started with an A) that worked there that was super nice and sweet, they better keep her or they will keep getting bad reviews."
"1","Don't want to be mean but this place sucked slow service I've only been twice and each time it took them 15 min to make my chia tea and this time drink is not good taste like all milk   All the girls stood around while the slow man making the drinks took forever. I won't be going back to this place sadly"
"2","Love the apartment, love the location.  The front office, with one exception, is awful.  The manager, Cynthia, is pleasant and professional.  Her staffer, Julia, is one of the worst workers in any role I've come across.  Late every day, doesn't respond to messages and 3 hr lunches daily are a few examples.  Fire this girl and start over.  How do you run a leasing office without a staffer there?!"
"1","This store has gone south in its cleanliness in the produce department. I was there on September 14th 2012 and made a complaint regarding how disgusting I found this area to be. The bins where the produce is displayed are sticky to touch and leave a slimy residue on your fingers and hands. It is transferred to some of the items packaged so when picked up it is passed on to your hands. The glass display near the South end looked as if it hadn't been cleaned in weeks.\nThis makes me wonder what I might have missed in the meat and poultry department.\nI also complained about the lack of maintenance on the carts as the majority are a pain to push around with bumping wheels that make the carts pull to one side making it difficult to guide them in the direction you wish.\nLast of all I made complaints about the lack of air conditioning during the hottest days this last summer with temp as hight as 113 degrees outside the building. \nI guess Walmart is trying to maximize profits as usual. Considering how they cheat foreign labor, paying little for a ten hour day six days or more per week, making massive profits per item sold you can hardly believe.\nSo much for Americas number one international business, another Corporate Exploiter.\nI would have taken some pics but my phone is broken.\nI don't know if it would have done any good to call the Health Department seeing how powerful Walmart is in America.\nI am going back to Other super markets nearby, it's cheaper in the long run and healthier ."
"1","Wtf. Only giving a 1 star rating because they changed the chicken enchilada soup. Who's the jackass who decided to change the soup. Steward fire him or her please. This bar was sooooo busy u had to fight to get to the bar what happened??? How much money ru you losing now? It's scary to think about it? Maybe It's about time to make a change. As business owner what the fuck are you thinking?"
"5","I am not a great golfer by any means. But i do love the sport. this course is great for beginners and good golfers alike. It's wide open with few houses in a hittable location unless you REALLY get a hold and slice or pull badly. water is a recurring nightmare and provides some good challenges. Greens were in pretty good shape. not perfect but compared to other courses for under 50 dollars a round I haven't found any better. \n\nThe part that sets this place a part from courses i go to is the employees and service. from the clubhouse counter all the way through to the food service were the best I've experienced.  ll actually have starters rolling around DOING their job and pushing the very slow groups along. My green fee included some draft beers and some food which i didn't plan on. and to top it off unlimited range balls. It was the best Saturday of golf I've had in Vegas."
"4","Only golf in SW... Always in pretty good condition. So many people think it would be narrow because its residential course, but its not- its pretty wide open. They have a full driving range and chip/putt area. \n\nI booked on golf now, but i heard the guy in front of me say he booked a pretty good price directly in their website?? I paid 40 on a hot deal.... Soo worth it.\n\nThey do have a mobile refreshment cart girl that comes around the course, selling snacks, liquor, beer... Cheers to that. \n\nThe restaurant at thd clubhouse looks pretty good... I did not get to try it, but will next time."
"5","VIP Golf recommended this place to me.  I think they hit it right on the nail.  It doesn't get any better than this.  We arrived in a cab and were greeted by some friendly staff who took our clubs and pointed us to where we check in.  A very friendly man checked us in, gave us a coupon for free breakfast or lunch as well as 2 drinks each.  \n\nWe ordered our lunch and 2 bottled waters to go.  The cart was supplied with ice in the cooler attached to the side.  \n\nWe met the starter, who gave us great instructions and answered our many questions.  The weather was perfect, the 2 people we were put in a group with were so nice.  \n\nThe course was beautiful!!  The guys with us were good the course was plenty challenging.  I am a new golfer and played the forward tees and enjoyed playable time and I only lost 1 ball :)  We took plenty of pictures, which I will try to post later.  \n\nWhen we were through, the staff carried our bags up front waiting for our ride while we headed to the 19th hole.\n\nOverall, I couldn't ask for anything better.  Friendly and efficient service from everyone we met.\n\nFinally, for all of this, the price was fantastic!  Golf club rentals from VIP Golf delivered to my hotel, 18 holes, cart rental, range time... all for one great price.\n\nI will definitely be back the next time I am in Vegas."
"4","Free Wi-Fi, Unlimited Coffee Refills of surprisingly decent quality, a handful of individually bagged hot teas, and now with 3-4 varieties of iced tea plus iced coffee - sure I'm not going to pay what they charge for a sandwich I could make for 1/3 the price using better ingredients at home, but for beverages and simply killing time or getting some work done there aren't too many places I prefer."
"5","I love coming to Panera! Ashley Love and Luke always brighten my day. The staff here is so amazing and friendly! We have been coming for years. Great food and wonderful service!"
"1","I have been to this location several times before and normally the food has been on point and the service has been decent. But after today's trip to Panera, it pains me to leave this 1 star review, but after what occurred today I felt that it was the only thing that I could do.\n\nFirst, they were out of Broccoli Soup at 12:45 in the afternoon. I would have understood had it been later in the day sure, but you are in the middle of the lunch rush and you run out of a key item. Second was I ordered a Tomato and Mozzarella Panini and it was the most pathetic thing I have ever seen. The sandwich had 2 pieces of mozzarella cheese, 4 slices of tomato and and a pathetic amount of sun dried tomatoes. Third, the Turkey & Bacon Sandwich had no flavor what so ever. The sandwich looked like they just threw it together and there was no care to what it looked like. \n\nThe only positive of this trip was the Peanut Butter Cookie, which is sad to say.\n\nIt really pains me to say this but I don't think I will be going back to this location and may not go back to Panera because this trip has really left a sour taste in my mouth."
"2","I waited almost 20 minutes while i watched others receive their food for soup, salad, and kids buttered noodles. When they finally brought out our food I was met with half wilted lettuce with nothing but dressing. I inquired about the croutons and was told they were out but never was I given the option to change my order  prior to this discovery. When I asked why it took so long I was simply told that the were busy. There were no attempts to make up for the slow service though the girl who brought the food out apologized, nothing else was done. I come here a lot and was shocked at this experience."
"4","We moved here about a month ago, and so far everything has been good! All the staff members have been very kind and helpful. The complex is great, for us and our pets, and we are excited to start enjoying all the amenities that includes. Hope to keep having a wonderful stay here!"
"4","It has a very nice, comfy and relaxing athmosphere.  It's like having ur own private dinner.  Excellent customer service."
"2","Gave this place a try, but was very disappointed for a \""5 star\"" steakhouse. This \""view of the strip\"" is more like a view of the las vegas strip street from a 3rd story window. There was a lady who would interrupt our dinner time suggesting that we take pictures. The pictures came out looked washed and unprofessional. \n I ordered the filet mignon while my boyfriend had prime rib. The steakhouse's version of \""medium rare\""  is prepared medium well. I was surprised because I was expecting my steak to be \""bloodier\"" on the plate. Also the steaks do not come with side orders, they have to be ordered seperately, for $7-$10 more. Nearly half of the prime rib my boyfriend ordered was fat. For such a nice place we expected at least the prime rib to have a lot less fat on it.\nWon't eat here again and I don't suggest anyone else to."
"4","I come to Las Vegas about five times per year to do two things, race my car and EAT. When it comes to eating, it's hard to beat the great choices in this town. That being said, I find myself wanting to return to the Range. I returned there on Friday April 1 and again the Range came through with wonderful service, great food, incredible ambiance including a smooth Jazz band.\nMy wife wanted a petite filet mignon, but the only small filet came with Lobster. That didn't matter, the waiter was glad to give her the filet without the Lobster and lowered the price accordingly. These people know how to treat their customers and they do it with grace and style.\nWe shared a great bottle of Pinot Noir from the new expanded wine list and we were glad to see several sleeper wines at fair prices.\nI'll keep trying the new restaurants, but when I need a tried and true favorite, I'm coming back to the Range!"
"3","We wandered in during our weekend staycation, not even sure we wanted more steak (we had been to a few steak places of late and wanted something different). We checked out the menu and decided that it was broad enough to give it a go.\n\nWe started out with white wine by the glass (a sauv blanc and a chard) and ordered a bottle of red for dinner. I wish now I could remember the recommendation, but both my companion and the sommelier were excited about it, and I loved the choices they were making. #winowin\n\nEschewing the steaks, I ordered a Caesar salad and the Oysters Rockefeller and he ordered the chilean sea bass. \n\nThe salad was good, crisp, and tangy. Nothing spectacular, but a solid Caesar salad. Fresh dressing from what I could taste, and plenty of ground pepper to taste. Always a plus.\n\nThe oysters were really tasty. Cheesy, spinach-y, garlic-y goodness on the half-shell. The oysters themselves were perfectly cooked and the Rockefeller preparation was fresh: the top was expertly browned and the layer below was creamy and all but screamed \""flavorful! Eat me!\"" A dish done very well.\n\nThe sea bass was... well, to say it wasn't good was an understatement. The ammonia smell coming from it was overpowering. We all know the \""freshening up\"" trick, and thankfully no one argued with us when we sent it back. To the server's credit (all the staff, really), they offered him another entree (no way were we asking for a repeat of that) and had a petite filet and au gratin potatoes back to the table in no time.\n\nThe filet was executed well. It was cooked as requested, had an excellent flavor, and was tender and juicy. I didn't try the potatoes but they looked good and my companion liked them a lot.\n\nThe service was excellent most of the time with a smattering of slow spots and one flag-down. The atmosphere is both casual and intimate, high-end without being stuffy, dark-ish without needing to squint to see everything. I would have liked to seen the patrons spread out more; I get that there are service loads to consider... but then seat the couples in more quiet areas and keep the families and larger groups closer together? I don't know how to make it fair, but it seemed like our quiet dinner was interrupted a little too often by the large groups to which we seemed a little too close.\n\nI really wanted to give it 3.5 - 4 stars. To be fair, they *did* handle the fish issue with grace. However, for what I expected and what they promise, it was just good. Not great, but good. A solid, A-OK experience. I would go back again, sure. I'd give it another shot, if just for the oysters and wine. \n\nPS - The living statue thingy at the front by the hostess desk? *small voice* It creeped me out. ;) #nolie"
"5","I'll definitely come here again on my next trip to Vegas. The food was outstanding and the service & price were great. We tried several dishes and loved all of them. I definitely recommend the following:\n\n- Escargot\n- Lamb chops\n- Creme Brulee\n- Lava Cake"
"1","Update 10/6/2014: I am starting to really tire of the repeat blunders by the campus administrators, staff, and all other campus agencies that shows its ugly teeth. In fact, if you read my previous reviews,  I often update and continuously lower the stars on a yearly basis.\n\nThis time it got pretty bad, for some reason the UNLV Parking and Enforcement sold 19,000 parking passes when there is just over 12,500 parking spots at any given time on campus. Local news coverage have covered this story in detail, such as KTNV and ABC 13 Action News (dated September 15th, 2014 available online \""UNLV students peeved over packed parking lots on campus\""). \n\nTo add fuel to the fire, for the first month and still ongoing, a majority of the white lot, that was meant for US, the PAYING STUDENTS who bought the passes, has been hijacked by tourists who take up hundreds of parking spots... MEANT FOR US, with semitrailers, Greyhound Bus Convoys, etc. \n\nNot only do we have to drive around wasting gas looking for a parking spot, but we often end up parking farther away from our classes that WE BORROWED AND SPENT TUITION MONEY ON, suffer from dehydration (I saw one lying on the ground on the first floor of the library being helped by cops and paramedics), and almost every lot is FULL. \n\nI drive a stickshift, and preferably I would NOT LIKE TO park inside the parking garage located next to Flamingo Road because of stop-and-go driving UPHILL and the extremely tight turning clearances we all have to make to get from one floor to another or to drive around a idiot student that is holding up traffic waiting for someone to back out. All of you fucks are contributing to the destruction of my clutch. \n\nWe have to endure the shit parking spots on a daily basis, even during our first exam week. We were the ones who paid to come here, to put up with incompetent teachers, lousy parking spaces, overzealous parking enforcement, and all of these tourist convention shitheads that want to make UNLV basically their semester residence, which displaces the rest of us from getting to class on time, or even to class at all. \n\nNowdays I advise just showing up on campus about 1 or 2 hours earlier. Just skip breakfast and your shower and just get to campus. Your going to lose your hygiene anyways from all the sweat pouring out your body from the miserable 20-30 minute walk out in 100+ degree fahrenheit weather. Just go shower at the Student Recreation Center instead."
"2","Obviously great selection of Rebel merchandise but outrageous prices. Seriously, the prices are almost twice what they should be. Why does the same hat cost $30 here, $20 at the ballgame, and $16 online from the manufacturer? But... If you want nice Rebelbilia, they've got stuff here that no one else carries. Bring a few quarters for parking."
"4","This has been our favorite neighborhood place for almost 8 years. It is well priced, always good Mexican food.  The staff is friendly, it's not very big or fancy but we've never had a problem with seating and the service is fast so they turn over tables quickly.  Definitely recommend.  We go every few months and have always liked whatever we have... recommend going next door to La Flor De Michoacan for dessert after or stopping by the connected bakery for a sweet treat.  We often go there for donuts on the weekend."
"4","The food was good! Everything was well priced .  I ordered a taco and enchilada .  The kids had Carne asada burrito.  Beans came with the meal we very good. Like home cooked beans.  The meal also come with rice I never eat rice at Mexican restaurants but I ate theirs.  The chips that come before the meal we huge. (Whole tortilla ).   The only down side is they are not by my house."
"5","First of all, let me preface my review by saying that Jorge and his crew are super nice. My office has worked with them in the past to cater several of our events, one involving 200 people and another 4,000 plus. Considering the mass quantities of food they served, the quality was not compromised. They are willing to accommodate any type of request.\n\nThat said, I've enjoyed their food multiple times at First Friday, and it has all been superb. You must try the sopes, quesadillas, and the fish tacos OMG! They  are phenomenal! Check them out now!"
"5","After moving to Las Vegas from NJ and letting my hair grow out for my wedding for the last six months I went to Cielo on Saturday desperate for a hair cut.  I gotta admit my hair was in really bad shape.  However, Jason was somehow able to make it look great again.  He listened to my concerns about not wanting it too short and gave me a great layered hair cut.  I love their shampoo chairs you can have your legs up so it's comfortable for your hair.  And he even massaged my neck during the shampoo.  Jason is very easy to talk to and I am so happy to find my new stylist.  Try him I'm sure you'll be happy too!"
"1","Slow unfriendly service surprisingly from a McDonald's. Food was not fresh either. Bathrooms were a dirty wreck as if in a roadside gas station. Take your business to a different McDonald's."
"5","Absolutely stunning and peaceful.  You could walk through Allegheny Cemetery 100 times and see something different every time.  Highlights include:\n\n-Stephen Foster & family buried here, famous songwriter and Pittsburgh celeb\n-A mausoleum with topless sphinxes out-front on \""Millionaire's Row\""\n-Various burgh politicians\n-Special section for Civil War Veterans and a memorial for all Vets\n\nIf you have the opportunity to go on a tour of AC offered by Venture Outdoors, do it!  The history and fun facts will blow you away.  Sneak peak - the first person buried in the cemetery was the daughter of the original cemetery owner.  Her grave is on a hill and faces where their house was originally located.  Cool, right?"
"5","umm, a beer hall in a church?\n\nthat's even better then a club in a church:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Limelight\n\nInteresting choices of beer, great pizza, and a decent menu of dinner choices."
"2","It's cool that they brew their own beers. I wasn't a huge fan of the food and beer, but it is a neat restaurant in Pittsburgh!"
"4","I travel for work a fair bit. In some cities it's easy to find tasty, unique (non-chain) places to eat; others not so much. So, when my colleague said, \""I heard about a brew pub in an old church,\"" my response was, \""Say no more--I am SO there.\""\n\nIt did not disappoint.\n\nWas it mind-blowingly delicious food? No, but it was tasty and enjoyable as far as road food goes. \nWas it the most amazing beer I've ever had? I don't know--I'm not exactly a beer snob.\nWas it a great place to kick back some beers with a colleague and a business partner? Definitely.\n\nSure beat eating in the hotel restaurant, or a mega-chain which is guaranteed to be uninspired and uninspiring fare.\n\nAs we left, I noticed they have a veggie patch out back. It's too early in the season for me to benefit from that garden, but I'm sure it makes its way to the table later in the summer, and that earns them an extra star in my book."
"2","Yes, you've got cool decor and a cool building and you make your own beer, and it's good beer. But the (granted) one time I was there, and got a beer at the bar, the service mas miserable. The worst service I have ever gotten. We were met by a smarmy bartender who after pouring our beers proceeded to ignore my friend and I as we tried to flag him down to order another beer and then when this proved unsuccessful (a check had magically appeared in front of us) attempted for at least 15 minutes to flag him down so that we could pay and get the hell out of there. Not a fan. Probably won't be back anytime soon."
"3","I went here to eat last week and it was beautiful,  The waitress/ bar tender was GREAT! \nJust curious has anyone noticed an awful smell?! I think its part of the brewing process but I really couldnt even eat it bothered me so much. Does anyone know if its liek that ll the time. There was a gentleman working on the alter so perhaps it was just bad timing? any input, id like to go back but scared ill be sick!? Food was good and beer was GREAT though."
"3","I went to the Church Brew Works based on a recommendation from a native of the burgh.   It is a very unexpected and interesting setup.  If you didn't know you were going to a restaurant, you really don't find out until you walk into the 'church'.   I'm a thin crust - brick oven pizza junkie !!  If there is a brick oven in the house, I usually can't resist.  I ordered the Chicken & Chorizo Pizza  - Chicken breast, chorizo sausage, basil oil, plum tomatoes, minus the red onion and jack cheese.  Pizza was good, not great but good.  Next time I will probably try the Buffalo & Wild Mushroom Meatloaf.   I also had the basket of homemade chips and these would have been a whole lot better if they were served warm."
"4","Is there anything more wrong their drinking beer at church? Yeah my pure enjoyment of the debauchery, why did my beer taste so much better in a church? Wine never does. And not only was my brew delicious it was priced right, my 2 fantastic pints were between $2.50 and $4.50 and both on point. \n\nSo as far as grub... It was way overpriced. We had Pierogies, which from my understanding are unique to the Burgh, they were delicious for four $3.25 for potato and cheese and $7.00 for Sausage and sauerkraut which was amazing. I had the Jambalaya which was pretty good, but not $18.00 good. So while the food and drink was good the price needs help, at least on the food. \n\nBeautiful Church by they way I hope you heathens enjoy drinking your wicked brew in it as much as I did."
"5","Now this is my kind of church!!  I almost couldn't believe what I was seeing when I made my first visit earlier this week!  It was a real church, serving food and beer.....and I loved it!  We had the wood-fired pizza and some Celestial Gold.  Beer was good, and pizza (Spinach, Feta and Artichoke) was excellent.  Service was good as well.  Will definitely return!"
"4","Big fan of the Church.  Their non traditional pierogies are almost always a great choice, paired with the pizza and their beer brewed on site, this is a must stop when in the Bloomfield area of Pittsburgh."
"4","Good, more than decent lunch/sandwich bar food food, great beer.  But the atmosphere is absolutely 5 stars of wonderful.  The church is spectacular, and the patio is lovely too.  Seeing hops growing on the walls outside really makes a point.  This place does beer well.  And the site itself is just wonderful."
"3","Pierogi pizza is amazing!!!! They ran out of traditional pierogis which was a total bummer but then we saw the pizza. It was more satisfying than pierogis on a cold rainy night. The red leaf side salad was tasty but over dressed and didn't come with the blue cheese the menu promised. The special pierogis of the night were not amazing because the butter added in unwelcome sweet flavor to the jalape\u00f1o, cheddar bacon yumminess. The beer was great and the interior of the place is fun. A large brewing system sits on the alter and is  quite beautiful. The reason the place did not get 5 stars is because honestly out service sucked and the fact that they use styrofoam to go containers. The waiter did not greet us, tell us specials or attend to us. At one point when we were finished (napkins on plates) for a few minutes waiting for the check he was in the corner watching the game."
"3","Cheap beer, neat setting, lots of seating but fairly quiet on a Saturday night around 11pm...I was pretty hyped in coming to this place but the vibe there was just too quiet and they didn't really have a lot of beer selection, altho they did have their own brewery in the background"
"3","The ambiance is perfect... The concept is amazing... However the downside is the not-so-spectacular fusion of flavors in the food. I ordered the buffalo meatloaf which tasted bland and the side vegetables tasted weird and overcooked. The wild boar pizza had no extra kick and isn't extraordinary. The sandwhiches such as yinkasa cheese stake was surprisingly excellent. All in all we had fun dining in this place but perhaps attention to more diligent food flavors is called for."
"5","This place is great. It is cool how they turned a church into a brew pub. The pom frites are awesome and the pizza is good."
"5","Loved the atmosphere and the beer. Great place to meet up with friends and have some good beer and food!"
"3","Went in for a pedi on my lunch break at 1pm and was taken right away, which was my main concern since I was on the clock.  They had a pretty decent color selection and the guy who did my pedi did a great job with the prep, but only an OK job on the actual polish application.  I paid $28 for my pedi plus tip which was a decent price.  It would not be my first choice for a mani/pedi splurge in the future but is great for quick service."
"2","I really am not a fan. I went here for an eye appointment and to get contacts for the first time. I told them I was very, very nervous about contacts and I had previously been told I was a bad candidate because I've always been really nervous about things in my eyes (for the record, I'm pretty relaxed about everything. I could probably fall asleep at the dentist...but there is just something about my eyes). \n\nWhen it came time for my first appointment to try on my contacts, I was having trouble getting the contacts in. The woman assisting me was getting clearly frustrated with me and had me almost in tears. I told her first thing that I was really anxious about contacts and that this was really stressful for me and she was just short of yelling at me about getting them in.\n\nMy doctor was the opposite...very nice and patient with me. However, when I told them I didn't feel like my vision was being corrected adequately (both with contacts and glasses), they said I had too high of expectations for what I should be able to see. I struggled to read the last two lines of letters on the chart. I can't read a license plate that is traveling a reasonable distance in front of me. \n\nThe whole experience was pretty terrible...I can't see great with the contacts and it was borderline traumatic being yelled at over putting in contacts in the first time (only to be completely disappointed with the results). I need to be able to see far distances for my job and we haven't been able to correct enough (I switched job roles in large part due to my problems seeing far distances). \n\nEarlier today, I called to order contacts (I had given up and just been wearing my glasses. But for vanity reasons & working with VIPs lately, I wanted contacts as an option). The person I spoke to kept insisting I had never done a contact trial with them, the eye doctor had never seen contacts on my eye and I needed to be trained how to wear contacts, since I had never gone through any of that with them. I was very insistent that I had gone through all of that several times. It was a fight before they finally agreed to order my prescription. I did go through with ordering three months (only because I don't have the time to deal with it right now), but I plan to take my prescription elsewhere and find a new eye doctor.  \n\nTerrible customer service and record keeping. Also...a bad selection of glasses. Really cannot recommend."
"2","This is a English/Scottish hyrbrid pub with a tad bit of Irish thrown in.  I am a huge fan of bangers and mash and so I couldn't wait to try out everything.  The hosts and servers were great and we were promptly seated.  There is a fairly new, clean interior that is split into a bar section and a dining section with some overlap depending on the group and what they are looking for.  I liked the atmosphere.  After perusing the menu, we settled on the following items:\n\nGaelic four onion soup\nScotch eggs\nOpen faced roast beef\nBangers and mash\nDraft Rootbeer\n\nThe Onion soup is NOT a French onion soup.  It is its own entity with its own ingredients and flavors.  Over time, I have learned to just expect a French onion knock-off when it comes to onion soup.  Kudos to Piper's Pub for doing something different.  There is a large crouton with stilton baked into it.  It tastes quite good with the soup.  My only issue with the soup was the onions -- they were not completely tender.  Is it possible to have the onions in the soup cooked a little longer to completely soften them up? I know this is a personal preference and I would probably order the soup again but I would only consume the broth.  \n\nWhile eating the soup I ordered a draft rootbeer.  Completely excited about having a good, fresh rootbeer.  I was somewhat flustered to find that it was somewhat weak when I tasted it, though.  The flavor was there, but why was it so watered down?\n\nMy first time having Scotch eggs.  It is a hardboiled egg encased in ground sausage, fried, and then served with hot sauce.  The flavors were interesting, but it was difficult to get past the flavor of the exterior.  It tasted overcooked and bordered on burnt.  Is this normal?  As we finished this novel, new appetizer our entrees arrived.\n\nBoth entrees looked awesome.  Spectacular presentation for both entrees.  I went directly for the sausage and my palate left me perplexed.  The banger they use has a heavy-handed spice.  I tried the sausage with the half-mashed potatos and the gravy in differing quantities and couldn't get past the flavor endemic in the sausage.  I had to stop eating it.  I was able to split the open-faced roast beef with my friend.  The gravy was good.  The half-mashed potatos were good.  The roast beef was good.  WHY did the bangers have such a high dosage of this anathemic spice?  \n\nHo Hum.  Will I return?  Yes, I will give Piper's another try; I will just make certain to steer clear of the bangers."
"5","I love Piper's for 2 things: brunch and sports. \n\nPiper's is the only place I've had boxty, and I probably wouldn't risk trying it elsewhere. This Sunday brunch special is a golden-brown potato pancake folded around a generous pile of eggs, cheese, and sausage. For the best meal, eat it with sides of bacon and horseradish mayo. Round out with a Ploughman's Platter. If you miss brunch, the best bet is to order anything featuring Stilton.\n\nPiper's is the place to go during the off season to get your fix of sports enthusiasm. It's got well-placed TVs, plenty of drink choices (scotch to ease those missed goals/rebounds/TDs) and fans aplenty in International soccer jerseys. Because there's always a game to get excited about."
"3","THE FOOD IS DELICIOUS!!!! Oh. WOW. Yes. The food is a tasty treat. I got the Toad in the Hole and it's in the running for my last meal.\n\nBeer selection is also delicious. I love that they have 5-6 beers on cask. There is enough variety to please beer drinkers of all shapes and sizes.\n\nSo, why the 3 stars? Oh, because it took 90 minutes for our food to come. It got pretty frustrating watching people sit down after us, eat, and pay the bill as we sat and twiddled our thumbs. We actually didn't twiddle- we drank. And got drunk before the food came. Classy.\n\nOur server was a nice dude- he took 10% off the bill... but I'm pretty sure he forgot to put our food in.\n\nUltimately, I WILL be back because this place is the cutest. I am sure I'll have a better experience next time."
"5","One of my favorite bar/restaurants in Pittsburgh.  I always find a seat at the bar and the service is always great.   The scotch eggs are out of this world!! \nThe beer selection is outstanding and although I love the scotch eggs .. there are many other menu items that are just mouth watering such as the turkey sandwich with dill mayo.. oh my..   lets go now!\n\nLove Pipers Pub!"
"5","I will make this brief.   This is not just the best Scottish pub in Pittsburgh, this might be the best pub / bar / restaurant in Pittsburgh - period. \n\nFOOD\nLove the scotch eggs but the cardiologist said to only have these once a decade.  Stilton and Rasher salad is incredible.  Pub burger is the BEST!  Reuben and Fish & Chips are excellent.  Open face roast beef on italian bread covered with a dark/rich whisky onion gravy and a side of half-mashed red potatoes = ultimate comfort food.  So many other great options - you cannot go wrong!\n\nDRINK\nLove the beer list.  There is a focus on imports but they also have a dozen or so excellent PA craft beers on the list.   This place takes everything that they do seriously - the beer tastes fresh and the lines are clean.  If you are a fan of scotch whiskey, the list at Piper's Pub cannot be beat - http://piperspub.com/scotch/\n\nSOCCER / FOOTBALL\nFans of the beautiful game rejoice - you have found your home at Piper's Pub.  This place is packed during the big games and they get satellite feeds beyond ESPN and Fox Soccer Channel.   Every once in a while, I get my boys out of school early and we throw on the EPL jerseys and we go catch an afternoon game at Piper's Pub with other raving lunatic fans.  This place is worth a 2 hour drive if you are not in the Pittsburgh area.\n\nDefinitely deserving of 5 stars.  Love it!"
"5","Where has Piper's Pub been all of my life!  This one establishment completely makes up for the bombardment of crappy faux-Gaelic pubs throughout the Pittsburgh region that are plague by bad service, poor food, and lame gimmicks.\n\nPiper's is the kind of place you can find refuge at 11pm on a Friday or Saturday night from the chaos that is the South Side.  Walk in, grab a seat at the bar, and have a conversation at a reasonable volume with your good friends over a fantastic draft selection.\n\nIf you're hungry, you're in for a treat.  Try anything on the \""over the pond\"" section of the menu, and you're sure to be pleased.  On the rare occasion I gain the courage to move past the Lamb and Smoked Chestnut Shepard's Pie, the Guinness Stew and the Bangers and Mash both present delicious alternatives.\n\nBachelor party dinner, father's day dinner, or an evening out with your friends, Piper's pub represents the one-size-fits-all multi-tool of food and beer pleasure."
"4","I want to commend the Goodwill for all the good work they do for the disabled, handicapped, mentally challenged and really anyone who needs a helping hand. This location sales about anything you would need, from clothes to shoes, mattresses and dishes. Oh and books!  There was a period of my life when I utilized the Goodwill driving services, which is a driving school. Their rates back there were $50.00, for an hour of instruction. Way cheaper than any comparable driving service that I could find at that time.  The instructor was an older gentlemen who was patient."
"3","I love a good sandwich. I had been looking for a quick sandwich shop in Pittsburgh for awhile. My boyfriend had gone for lunch before and suggested it. He had wanted to go back for some time but kept forgetting what the name was. A Deli on Carson Street named Carson Street Deli can be a mind bender, I guess. \n\nTheir sandwiches are good and all their stuff is really fresh. They also have a good selection of beer to have with your sammy so, that's a plus! \n\nThe beers are in with soda and other drinks and when we brought our beers up to the counter to pay for them the cashier made sure to lean in really close to check our eye colors to make sure they matched our IDs. That was hilarious but it didn't make my Cool Breeze tuna sandwich taste any less! Definitely a great place for lunch."
"1","The vibe of this place seems very sketchy, and the fact at all of the work on the walls has prices seems a bit off. The staff are unfriendly and rude and do not greet you after you walk in for a good ten minutes or so. That being said, I do not know about tattoo work here. Piercings, however, are a different story.\nDon't do it.\nThe woman who did them did not seem to know what she was doing, and did not even clamp the area before piercing, causing bleeding. And then she went on to make fun of my friend for this, for a good long time. Talk about unprofessional! She also refused to put in the type of jewelry requested, and only put in the type she first grabbed, even with an explanation about why this type of jewelry would be the worst for the piercing. \nI had heard good things about this place, but I see know that everyone was very mistaken. In the future, if I ever need another piercing or tattoo, be assured that I will not be going here. Or trusting the judgement of said friends."
"1","Horrible bar. Horrible crowd. If you're over the age of 22 avoid at all costs."
"2","DISCLAIMER: I've only ever tried the sushi. I have no clue about the hibatchi bar.\n\nI was delighted to see that I'm not the only one who finds this place to be completely overrated and overpriced. The sushi was your average run of the mill raw fish. Nothing special about the freshness or the imaginitivity of the rolls. That is, except for the price. I couldn't believe that a meal for such average sushi cost as much as it did. \n\nIf you're looking for some decent raw fish to feed your sushi craving, try Chaya in Squirrel Hill instead. You won't regret it."
"4","Good place.  Almost always very busy... Might want to make a reservation.  The chefs don't seem to have a whole of personality.... And they are often times not Japanese at all... But the food is good nonetheless."
"4","Pretty average sushi bar good food, great location. I'm a fan of this place."
"3","The food is good. I've  never had the sushi but Ive heard  it's very good. I only gave 3 stars bc the service is AWFUL   The manager is a pompous asshole,  Is annoyed at life And  doesn't care if you have a complaint. Acts like your disrupting his life if you have a concern. \nI've eaten here and had a few good experiences but I've also has really awful experiences as well and haven't been back"
"2","The fascination with Nakama has always left me confused. I'm not a huge hibachi fan, so my gripes truly rest with the sushi. As far as sushi goes, Nakama simply doesn't deserve the praise that it gets. Granted, when they first opened, the food was decent, but even back then it was never a truly great sushi place.\n\nNow, if you like your sushi over-saturated in sauces, then you might enjoy it, but all too often, the rolls are soggy, poorly rolled, and the fish quality isn't as good as you'd expect if you were judging the restaurant from the outside. Blame it on the pace with which the chefs have to prepare it...blame it on them hiring inexperienced sushi chefs. Whatever it is, it's just not up to par with some of the other sushi places in Pittsburgh. In fact, the sushi at the Tokyo Buffet on McKnight is just as good...AND THAT'S A BUFFET!\n\nRegardless, it's always packed, and I'm a huge fan of seeing businesses succeed in town, but Nakama is truly a place that's gained too much from its trendy status. Unfortunately, I'm all about the food, so after you enjoy a good martini and enjoy the little hibachi show, what you're left with is the reality that the food is second priority to those other two parts.\n\nThe hibachi is fine, but it's nothing special...of course, when is hibachi ever truly a special experience, taste-wise? It's just a buttery fried rice fest in your mouth. The best hibachi I've ever had at Nakama was the ahi tuna...the cut of fish was actually fresher than sashimi that I've ordered there, and keeping it seared, but rare in the middle kept it from drying out. Or maybe that was just the butter...either way, it's by far the one thing that I've walked away with good feelings about.\n\nThe sashimi cuts that I've had have rarely satisfied. Fresh fish shouldn't taste so fishy, and for what you pay, they should be serving up better cuts. The sushi menu is interesting enough that you'll be able to find what you're looking for, but it's truly a hit-or-miss experience when the sushi hits your taste buds.\n\nOverall, Nakama is the hot spot where you meet your friends before hitting the clubs and make random friends over some happy hour drinks, but if you're looking for a quality meal, I'd enjoy the drinks and move on to any number of better restaurants nearby."
"2","The biggest issue we had and what made us leave sooner than we wanted were the myriad fruit flies buzzing around around the bar area.\n\nVisited Michael's Pizza Bar mid June 2013 with a friend. We sat at the bar and were quickly helped. The service was great. We ordered the french fries (they were out of jalape\u00f1os) and a sausage and banana pepper pizza. We received the fries and the pizza at the same time. No problem...but the cook piled so many peppers on the pizza one couldn't see the pizza. The crust and sauce were good, but I found the sausage to be wanting."
"4","Love some Tiki Lounge.\nDrink specials? A waterfall?\nJungle black out time."
"2","I honestly had no idea what we had walked in to. I felt as if we were in Legends of the Hidden Temple and were about to play the blue barracudas for the win. \n\nIt was definitely tropical themed and they even passed out leis at the door. There were fish tanks and water falls, tiki cocktail glasses and rainforest decor. Over all this would have been a fun place to hang out if it weren't for a few problems I had.\n\nFirst of all, I ordered a cherry bomb and she gave me the gun fake \""red bull\"". She didn't tell me they didn't have regular red bull before pouring my drink and it is not good. I decided to drink it anyway because I was in a good mood. Second, the hallway with the bathrooms smelled awful. Almost fishy. Which fits with the theme but is not something I want to smell in a bathroom. They were really cool on the inside with shell sinks and rock walls, but my amazement was ruined by smells of a fish tank. Lastly, the dance floor was WAY too small. We could barely move let alone dance. With all that room in that building, they should really expand that area.\n\nI would give it another chance for the fun idea of it."
"5","an oasis in the fratastic stretch known as carson street. while there are other legit (and respectable) bars on the southside, dee's has always been my favorite.\n\nthe drinks are cheap and the interior dingy but comfortable. i hang out here and pretend to miss my friends calls to meet them at town tavern.\n\ni can easily say this is the one bar i miss since moving to new york."
"5","I love this pizza"
"2","First off let me say this, if you want authentic French cousine... go elsewhere this isn't anything close to resembling real french cuisine.\n\nThat being said, we went here for a birthday dinner.  The atmosphere was charming and quaint.  The waitstaff was kind and willing to explain if there were any questions.  The food... was... boring.  Completely boring.  There was nothing resembling what i have expected.  Being that I've eaten real french cousine cooked by a frence chef, this was a let down.  At almost 300 for all of us... I would never, ever go there again.  Even the desert was lacking.  The wine was bland.  The entree was overcooked and underwhelming.\n\nThey should consider hiring a chef who is familiar with authentic french cousine, or change the name of the joint."
"5","Hands down best gyro in Pittsburgh in my opinion.  Possibly the best gyro ever.  Even at 2am when there's a line of drunk people waiting, the staff is quick and efficient.  Clearly they've been doing this for awhile.  The fries are not the best, but for some reason I always get them with the gyro because they taste so good together.  The gyro is so jam packed with goodness that when they hand it to you you don't think it's that big...until you unwrap the foil and start eating it.  I always eat mine so fast that I nearly choke.  I can think of no sweeter death.\n\nI used to frequent Mike & Tony's on a regular basis when I lived in the South Side.  Now that I don't, I try to stop by whenever I happen to be in the neighborhood.  I just can't resist."
"5","Get me early cuz they go quick! If you get them while they are hot you'll be hooked for sure! Best soft pretzel anywhere!"
"3","It's exciting that they are now doing brunch. I wish more places in south side would start seeing its a good idea. \n\nI've been there twice now, I've ordered the same thing both times \""moms chicken sandwich\"" (I think that's the name of it) and its really good!  Problem is the portions are small. It's not terribly priced for what it is, but I walked away still hungry and I am really not a big eater. They give you a small green salad (with nothing in it) and that's it. \n\nThey also have brunch drinks and their mimosas are cheap and good."
"3","I have never seen more the seven diners in 1889 Cafe at one time. Seriously. I'm amazed that they're able to stay open, since I'm sure East Carson real state ain't cheap. \n\nThe upside to the lack of clientele is that the food comes out fast. Prices are slightly high, but the burger and fries are tasty, and my friends love the  chicken stirfry. It's great for when you want to go out to lunch and not use your entire hour."
"2","Ok place for a lunchtime burger or breakfast.\n\nThe food is consistently okay but not great.\n\nThe staff are also ok. \n\nOverall the place is remarkably average in an area with places that are much much better."
"1","Based on the great reviews, .I decided to give this place a shot.  MISTAKE.  My food was greasy and overwhelmed by salty sauce.  The salad was limp, damp and smelled like old hay.  Inedible.  Ridiculously expensive for what reminded me of a bad night at Stuckey's truck stop....And the seating was uncomfortable.  Tiny tables without room to get between them without dragging your shirt and rear end on the next guys table.  \n\nMy friend had a cocktail that tasted like dish soap.  My wine was suggested by the waiter, apparently the restaurant sommelier had graduated from the \""Walmart school of real good wines\"".  When I told the waiter that I was unhappy with my wine, they were happy to bring me another drink...it wasn't until I received the bill and spoke to them about it that they were really just happy to sell me another while leaving the wine on the check.  \n\nAvoid this bad food/expensive tab/bad service restaurant."
"1","This is a truly terrible distributor. The staff always seems incredibly inconvenienced to help you, the service is curt, the prices are higher than anywhere around, and the only time you can get a cold case seems to be in the winter when they leave the garage doors open and use mother natures refrigerator. Avoid this place, there is a much better distributor on 10th street."
"5","Best service I've ever had anywhere!!! I'm from MI and travel the entire east coast all the time. I love Yuengling and they had the best price and were truly kind. I would definitely recomend this place."
"4","I finally got to go here a couple of months ago, and if I can ever wake my significant other up early enough on a Sunday for brunch I will go again! \nI went for a sunday brunch and the food was outstanding. The buffet offered a lot (I was tempted to run out of the place with the giant bowl of Thai peanut noodles). The buffet was cold dishes, noodles, fruit salads, pasta salads, etc...and they offer a hot food menu on top of that - all vegan of course. On this occasion, if I remember correctly, I had something along the lines of a vegan crepe. I do remember that it was really good. \nThey also have a VAST variety of teas.\nAnd the price was amazing - 10$ a head.\n\nA few things to know:\nGet there early. They will not seat you unless your whole party has arrived. For Sunday brunch they open the doors at 11. I got there at 1030 and the line was beginning to form. They do offer coffee while you wait to  be seated, and it is in an antique shop so there is a lot to keep you occupied.\nAt Sunday brunch they do not offer to-go containers for I think obvious buffet-related reasons. \nEverything there is for sale. Everything. Like the chair you are sitting on? Ask a price."
"5","Here it is my 100th review here on my favorite website. If any place is deserving of being my big milestone review it's Zenith.\n\nWhile I'd been there more than once before, it had been too long and I didn't think I could accurately review it without more recent research being done. (Which is a great excuse for me to go back and have brunch again and again and again. I am a research assistant extraordinaire.) Let's take two things I love thrifting/antiques and brunch and smash them all together into one Sunday morning good time. \n\nThe interior of this store/restaurant is so full of interesting bits that there are things literally hanging from the ceiling. When you walk into the main room it's almost a feeling of sensory overload. So many fun items to look at and touch. You can buy everything, right down to the chair you sit in while you eat and the dishes you use. It's not particularly a perfect place for preschoolers though as some pieces are precariously perched and practically praying to be pushed over. (Like that alliteration I used there? Priceless!) Just one hiccup, a lot of items have no prices on them and I'm not really sure where you take an item you want to purchase.\n\nIt's best to get there before they open at 11am as a line begins to form immediately. For $10 you get to pick an entree (of which they have 5 or 6 options which change each week), hot or cold tea or coffee, and access to the buffet. The options are vegan or vegetarian and they always have fresh fruit and fresh baked breads. The dessert table is usually various pies and bundt cakes. The flavors are great and subtle too.\n\nIt's a small space so if you're claustrophobic or don't like beat sat with strangers this most likely isn't for you. They do take cards or cash so you're safe either way. \n\nIf you're looking for a unique brunch experience you'll want to make the Southside a stop off."
"1","OMG\nTerrible even my wife likes vegetarian and hated this \nQuick give me a real egg and meat!! Even sub par for veggie lovers \nThe first experience with a yelp recommendation I was totally turned off by"
"5","Are you kidding me?  A vegetarian dream in an odd Antique store?  Yep and fantastic prices and wonderful food to boot.  More than reasonable prices, portions and panache. Seriously, though, this hole in the wall is worth finding."
"1","If you want service with a smile, don't go here. These guys all seem asleep on the job and uninterested in providing any type of customer service.\n\nI went to the shop to take a look at paper weight and asked their opinion on the best paper to use for an invitation. They handed me a book and basically walked away - so forget about consultation of anything. I emailed in my print job and they sent back a proof. When I responded with edits, I didn't hear back for a few hours, and then I got a message saying my print job was ready. After taking the time to drive around the Southside to find parking and then waiting in line to pick up my order, I was disappointed to see that they had printed off the original proof (and on some sort of giant flimsy postcard with the invitation on one side and the addresses on the other - not sure how they thought that made sense, and especially when my email clearly talked about printing envelopes, etc.). So they said they would fix it and reprint, but offered very little apology for the inconvenience. So two hours later, I finally was able to pick up the print job.\n\nI thought I would give them a second chance, mostly because a friend had reccommended them and I thought maybe the previous mishap was just a fluke. Unfortunately, the second time I tried to use them, they never responded to my email. I was near the shop and stopped in to follow up and they told me they couldn't print the project for me (addressing envelopes) because my envelopes were the wrong size. The sleepy sales clerk was answering me in as few words as possible and when I asked if there was anyone else I could go to for this job, or what my alternatives were, he just said \""I don't know.\"" While customer service is obviously not their speciality, I guess I was hoping printing was and maybe they could say, \""we have these other envelopes,\"" or \""you can use labels.\"" Instead, I cancelled my order and left.\n\nIf you want anyone to take a moment to walk through options with you, go somewhere else because these guys are strictly here to hit print."
"5","Why haven't more people reviewed this place?  Is it because it's a mixture of two things we are taught to be bad for us at different ages?  Is it because the building looks ominous as you walk towards it.  Or is it because people are too lazy to discover this place?  Whatever the reason, shame people, shame.\n\nI've never really paid attention while I was in here much, except for today.  As I looked around my eyes widened.  I was...a kid in a candy store!  Literally.  Candy, candy everywhere.  Candy that will take you back to your childhood and maybe even further than that.  I definitely practiced good self control in here, or else I would have been broke by the time I walked out the door.\n\nYes, I admit, I also ventured back to the \""adult\"" section.  Selection is vast.  Prices are some of the best, even better than the local corner market or gas station.  Staff were rather fun to deal with.  Joking and talking in there raspy voices.  I'll definitely know I will be stopping back in here when I'm in the area."
"1","Holy hell, don't eat at this BK.  It's dirty, crackheads swarm it, there are roaches.  Multiple people I know have gotten very sick from eating at this BK.  If you're craving Burger King, go else where."
"4","Awesome in the single word! Affordable in the second word! Easy to find out whatever you need  gifting shop also can be said. Actually I love books and also this store like due to the service I have taken from them. Taken different types of books mentioned good."
"1","This Salvation Army definitely has its fans. I've known people that would salivate at the idea of a Saturday afternoon spent digging through this store. You can, occasionally, find some good stuff here, but it takes a lot of digging and perseverance, and I find the price point to be way past my thrift flinch point, usually. \n\nThere are two levels. The lower level is furniture, housewares, linens, books, and toys. Basically, everything they carry besides clothing. The organization here on this level is..... well, \""organization\"" is such a strong word. Let's just say that the sections are free spirits that are not limited by arbitrary\""categories\"" for your ease. Most everything is pretty dirty. You can find ebay-worthy stuff sometimes, but I just don't ever feel like it's worth my time. \n\nUpstairs, you will find a cram-packed clothing section. Men's, Women's, Children's, purses, jackets, coats and shoes stuff each rack to the bursting point and then there are the wall displays -- \""selected items\"" are hung on nails, all the way up to the ceiling. Yes, you have to ask for help to get stuff down. \n\nThere's a decent mix of old and newer stuff, but I rarely, rarely find things I want to buy. I think a lot of the merch is overpicked regularly by some savvy shoppers on the southside. I definitely feel like this location is supported by a captive population. \n\nOf the few items I have purchased here, many of them had mystery stains or holes I didn't notice before I bought them, sadly. This is the thrift store in PGH I am most likely to leave Completely Empty Handed (a special feat, one that I perform only rarely)."
"4","Look, I know Carson St has a million other places to eat, don't worry you'll have time to eat them all.  Whatever you do though, go to this location and order food, sit at the front window and eat and afterwards have that cone or blizzard.\n\nI have eaten here more times that 50 and I'll tell you 48/50 times my food was fresh, hot, made quick and always served with a smile. This is a huge secret of Carson.  You could eat lunch for $5.00!  Who can beat that.  Dinner might be $7 or $8 but whatever they do to that food, it always comes out tasting home made, not fast food.  Chicken Strip Baskets, BLT's, Shrimp Baskets, Chili & Cheese Fries, Half Pound Burgers, and Pepsi Products!  yes, Pepsi... not Coke Products.\n\nIf I say anymore I might over sell it,just know it's well worth your money no different than any other place on that block for lunch.  \n\nP.S. My favorite flavored blizzard is Banana Cream Pie followed closely by Cookie Dough."
"5","I'm pretty sure Brewski's is my favorite dive bar.  Definitely in the South Side, possibly in the whole city.  I spent so many Friday nights there when I was younger that part of my love could be just because I have such fond memories.  Even when it's packed, it's still a good time.  I'll be gone for years and the bartenders still remember me when I return.  And you can't beat the prices.  \n\nDon't go if you hate crowds, though.  This place will get packed.  But if you think you can handle it, don't be afraid to go to the back.  There are tables with more space to move around that people either forget about or don't know are there.  Standing around the bar can get annoying with people walking back and forth so I'd recommend working your way to the back and setting up camp there.  You can still get the bartender's attention from the far end of the bar.  An added bonus: you'll be closer to the awesome jukebox."
"3","It looks like a lot of people are split on Tom's.  Now lets get the obvious out of the way.  It is the Southside people, plus this is a late night diner, plus this is the SOUTHSIDE.  The diner is not in the greatest of conditions but the booths are big enough to seat a group of 6 which is great at 2am.  Be nice and your food will come out faster, at like a hooligan and you will probably be waiting a little longer.  But in general the food normally comes out pretty fast\n\nNow, to the food.  A couple things.  Stick to the breakfast, because it is good and nothing beats a good breakfast spot after a night at the bars.  The pancakes and breakfast sandwiches are my favorite.  \n\nSecond, I really thing they have a good late night gyro.  Don't ask why out of all the places in the Southside that I choose Tom's to get a Gyro, but they have an XTRA Large Gyro.  The moment I saw that on the menu, I just could not resist.  The end of result: I was good because it was a very large gyro, but the quality of meat was not of Mike and Tony's.  But I did not expect it to be great because it was so large and that was enough to satiate me at the time.  \n\nOverall, Tom's is your spot for a some good food and a place to go over the bad decisions you may have made earlier in the night."
"2","I was generous with a 2 star rating only because they have 2 good bartenders and its a good place to grab a quick six pack. However, the manager is rude, the food that was once decent is now terrible (I've recieved food with hair in it, and have waited over half an hour for half a dozen wings that made me incredibly sick.) Also the crowd they attract isn't a good one. It's hard to walk in to get a 6pack without someone trying to pick a fight. I try to avoid this place. Also a waitress tried to argue that creamy italian was ranch. No, it's not."
"5","This is a great place to grab a quick bite to eat. The place doubles as a bar up at the front and a unique sit down family restaurant towed the back. \n\nAs far as the bar goes, the drinks are super cheap, and they have 40s to go at the cheapest price on Carson St. The bartenders are always friendly, and ready to mix up your next favorite drink.\n\nThe food like is super good, known for their deep fried fish sandwiches, all of it is home made. I personally love their clubs and Reuben sandwiches. The place always has great food specials, and the family owned staff is always super friendly and ready to serve. The food is also super cheap compared to other bars in the South Side. They could definitely up their prices 20% and still be reasonable. \n\nOnly negative thing I would say about this place is it needs updated a little. Lose the old paintings on the wall. Haha"
"4","Good strong fresh coffee. Cool but still friendly staff. Unhurried vibe. Super cute decor. Love it here"
"5","Bam!  That's how excited I am to write this review.  I've had Cafe Du Jour bookmarked \""To Try\"" for over a year, and I'm angry I haven't come sooner.  We had one of our best dinners in the 'burgh the past two years.  \n\nIt was sold to me as a French Bistro - but it's really not.  None of the items are classic French comfort food, such as a coq au vin, duck confit, pate, or other type of items.  I think it falls in the New American cuisine.  Correction, it is delicious New American cuisine.  Soy-glazed meatballs ($10), pork, apple butter and brie crostini ($10), fennel rubbed pork chop with crispy kale($24), chicken breast stuffed with feta and spinach ($24), are some of the items that I can recall.\n\nThere isn't a website, and the menu you can find on allmenus seems to be a lunch menu, and outdated.  I wouldn't let that deter you at all - you just have to trust your fellow Yelpers who rave about this place.  I do disagree on the $$ designation.  Two people with 2 apps, 2 entrees, 1 desert, and a cork fee was $86 (and $100 adding tip).\n\nNow, it is small, or at least while the patio is closed.  8 tables or so, and only 4 staff it seemed.  One host/waiter/runner, one chef, one sous chef, and an extra hand.  The pace between our courses was a bit longer than usual, but it didn't really bother me like it usually does.  The staff is working hard, and you can see it, and the food is so good I didn't really care.  And as mentioned elsewhere, BYOB with $2/stem.\n\nThis restaurant needs to be the next place you go."
"5","This is a huge thrift store that is about as organized as I have ever seen a thrift store be! It has a huge selection of almost any single item you are looking for. Be careful, you can easily spend an entire afternoon lost  in a treasure hunt! Great prices and pretty decent condition of most of the items, too! \n\nI will continue to go back and search for new  treasures!"
"3","If I have to shop at any giant eagle in my area, it would be this one. The sq. Hill location has more offerings but the employees all hate their lives and are either flirting with each other, on their phones, conversing with another employee, or just effin rude. The employees at the greenfield location are so much more personable and helpful."
"4","One of my favorite pizza places in the city. The staff is really what makes this place. I used to work over in Greenfield and they got so used to seeing us and made us feel welcomed. You can tell they truly appreciate the business. Price wise everything is very reasonable and the food is great quality. You also get huge portions as well. I've had their pizza, breadsticks, hoagie and fries. All very good! When we ate at the shop, I really enjoyed their second dining room of to the side. It wasn't anything special, but they kept it very clean and have a TV. For those who would be interested, they also have beer to go."
"5","Are you hungry for something more substantial?  Jozsa is an unusual place, and a very rich cultural experience.  Hungarian music, stories, folk art, and absolutely deliciously authentic down home Hungarian family style cooking.  Alex the chef and owner is larger than life and he is on a mission to share the Hungarian food and cultural traditions.  There's nothing fancy about this place...it's a different kind of dining ambiance.  Alex cooks whatever he wants and he keeps bringing it in generous platters to your table.  Home made bread, pickled red cabbage, Chicken Paprikash, Hungarian Goulosh, and more. It's BYOB, there are wine glasses and openers on a side table.  Everything is paper plates and plastic spoons.  Cash only. Appointment only.  Second Friday of the month is a special Hungarian Cultural night and it's discounted prices and features an enhanced cultural experience."
"3","Bruegger's is connected to the building where I work. So, anytime I need to grab something quickly and it's raining or snowing outside, I come here. The food isn't spectacular, but it is dependable. You can create your own salad, and they usually have three soups to choose from. Because I'm not a big bread eater, I normally stick with soups and salad, but I do hear the bagels are delicious.\n\nThe chicken they use for salads looks and tastes like mystery meat, so go for the ham or no meat at all. There are a variety of veggie options for salads, so I usually do veggies. You can also add nuts, dried cranberries, or diced apples.\n\nToday I had the chili because I was craving something hearty. It was nice and spicy, and I could visibly see the chunks of bell pepper in the soup. I would definitely get it again on a cold day.\n\nThis location is convenient to almost anything on Grant Street or in the vicinity of the William Penn Hotel. The interior is on the small side, so if you want to sit during lunch, come at 11 or after 1:30."
"1","I have been here a few times and have always had a good experience with the wait staff and considered the food to be passable.  Before last week, I would have probably actually given this place a nice 4 star rating.  HOWEVER, I work in the area and drive past the diner on a daily basis at about 6:30-6:45 in the morning and what I saw the other day has turned me off of this restaurant forever.  As I was on my way to work, I was stopped at a light in front of the closed diner and saw a man prepping the food for the morning rush and he was SMOKING while working with the food.  I am not squeamish when it comes to smoking for the most part, but this is not 1960 anymore and there are health department regulations.  The more I think about it, the more utterly disgusting it is to think of the potential cigarette ashes in my food.  After seeing that, I will NEVER, NEVER, NEVER eat there again."
"5","I wish I could live on Jean-Marc's macarons.  Seriously incredible.  \n\nWe have had Jean-Marc cakes for multiple special occasions, and they are always fantastic.  His buttercream is to die for...actually, everything here is to die for."
"5","I don't really have a favorite incline, the Monogahela one is wonderful too. This is just such a great way to experience Pittsburgh. It's cheap, only takes a few minutes, but the view is just spectacular, then you can walk around up on Mt. Washington and enjoy a truly beautiful city (sad that so many people still think it is a gritty steeltown). There's neat churches and neighborhoods to explore up there too. If it's your first time to Pittsburgh, you HAVE to ride the incline, touristy or not. Sometimes there's a good reason all the tourists do the same thing."
"2","The incline is attractive, but the staff were universally rude and treated the customers much like cattle."
"1","$2.50 each way, pay at the bottom though and really no one managing who pays and who doesn't.  Lady at payment window says \""Exact payment.\"" Not $3 not $5, $2.50 exactly! If you don't have exact, then your screwed.  Then you go to give her your exact change and she yells at you to put it in an \""Exact Change\"" box outside the window.  *Sigh*\n\nWhen you get to the bottom there is absolutely NOTHING to do whatsoever.  So save yourself the walk and turn back around and get on the 30 minute line to ride back up...this is if you parked at the top. \n\nVery poorly managed.  Nice views but that's it, so as long as you don't mind spending money for ride and parking just for a 2 min ride to enjoy a view."
"4","This totally IS a tourist trap. There are signs down the block as soon as you get off the monorail thing to go up the Mountain in Pittsburgh. Though, I was a tourist for the day in a not so touristy town. Also, I LOVE ice cream and there aren't that many places to go to up here. Kind of a cute mom and pop shop. You can tell its been around for ages. At least since my sister was in college. ha. \n\nThey only have 4 or 5 soft serve flavors and then a few scoop ice creams. I settled for a mix of chocolate/vanilla because the only other flavors were apple pie and French vanilla bean and neither jumped out at me. My sister got Moose tracks ice cream. Much more decadent. She also made sure to slather on some cherry sauce because she's weird like that. Though, the combination of her concoction actually was pretty great and tasted like a cherry Garcia sundae with peanut butter cups. Crazy. My small waffle cone was about 8 times the size I expected for its value and I appreciate it. There's no where to sit really inside so take your cones to go and enjoy that fresh Mountain air!"
"1","Absolutely horrible service! They not only charged us for waters (the same price as a soda) without mentioning it to is when we ordered, but after we paid we realized they charged us for an extra cone. When we realized our bill was off the cashier told us too bad and didn't offer any solutions."
"3","The Grandview Saloon has one of the best views of Pittsburgh from Mt. Washington from its patio. The views from the interior of the restaurant are not bad either.  To go with your view, you can choose from a good selection of drinks and more mediocre Pittsburghesque (i.e., comfort) food. The design of the patio is fine, but the interior of the restaurant is very plain. This is a shame, because with a little work on the interior design and menu, the view could make this one of the city's most interesting restaurants. \n\nIn short, I would not go here to celebrate an anniversary, but it's a good place to take first-time visitors to see the city while enjoying a tasty beverage."
"5","Love, love this place. I was in Pittsburgh just for a day and came here by accident, the views of Pittisburgh are amazing and the drinks were really good. \n\nI didn't get to try the food but I will make sure to come back here next time I'm back in town."
"4","One helluva view and fantastic jalape\u00f1o crab dip.  Pair it with some ice cold beer and this place is sure to be a hit during the summer time!"
"4","I haven't eaten here yet, but would give five stars for the view alone!  My dad and I went to the Duquesne Incline and then had some time to burn before his flight home, so we stopped next door at the Grandview Saloon for a beer and to hang out for a bit.\n\nThe patio is fantastic with a wonderful view of the rivers, and you can watch the incline go up and down.  They had a decent selection of beer (although we were uncreative and went with Yuengling) that was nice and cold and reasonably priced given the location.  Our server was prompt and friendly.\n\nI'm guessing there's more interesting food options in downtown Pittsburgh, but I'd definitely stop here for the view again, especially with visitors."
"2","Grandview Saloon is only Grand for their view.  We sat in the upstairs dining room over looking the city.  I was surprised this was not an open air space, specially since we were dining in August.  Minus 1.\n\nSince we had a large enough group, we ordered 3 appetizers, calamari, bruschetta, and another fried dish.  The calamari was good, but nothing I haven't had at many places before.\n\nI was not in the mood for a meat dish, so I ordered a pasta dish.  I inquired about how heavy the sauce was (it sounded like a white wine sauce and I wanted to make sure it wasn't a cream sauce).  The server assured me it wasn't too heavy.  I was presented with a late of pasta for a family of four, with some vegetables mixed in, doused with a mound of creamy white sauce.  Much to my disappointment, I could only  eat a small portion, and since we were going out after dinner I couldn't take anything to go.\n\nI visit Pittsburgh a few times per year, this is one place I will not be asking to return to."
"4","Excellent service and very attentive. Had the loaded fries and grilled chicken sandwich, which were both good. Solid bar food."
"4","Went for Sunday brunch. The food was sub-par. Good, but it's breakfast food, so hard to screw up. The service was outstanding. It was a slow morning, so we were able to get to the buffet with no problem. I had one of the made to order omelets, very good. Instead of waiting for it, they brought it down to us. Not sure if this is a usual practice, but it was appreciated. The bagel/croissant was dry. The bacon (from the looks of it), not super crispy. Although I don't eat meat, I have yet to know a person who doesn't like crispy bacon. Potatoes were really good- very impressed with use of the red pepper in them. (So underused an under appreciated by most restaurants). I would go back!"
"4","The Shiloh really makes you feel like you are home. The food is really good, the beers are varied, tasty and refreshing and the drinks are very moderately priced. I am not from Pittsburgh but I go there often and I always make the Shiloh my first pit stop! \n\nDo it!"
"1","I took my friend there for Sunday brunch today, and it was one of the worst brunches I've ever had in Pittsburgh.  Very limited selection of foods and what was on the buffet was cold and unappetizing.  Very sad excuse for a buffet brunch.  The corn muffins were dry and crunchy.  The fresh fruit on the buffet consisted of sections of red grapefruit and oranges.  There were no fresh veggies, no multigrain anything, no pasta salads, nothing at all interesting or healthy.  And the decaf coffee was horrible -- burnt tasting.  The only redeeming things were the made-to-order omelet station and the alcoholic drink that was included in the $14.99 price.   I felt badly that this is where I celebrated my friend's birthday."
"4","Visited the Shiloh on a Sunday evening before things started getting busy. This is a friendly unpretentious place that is inviting.   It was too cool to enjoy the deck dining. The offering of craft beer on the menu were plentiful, but sadly the two my man wanted had kicked and there was no back up.  He found a third to try, but really wanted his first pick.  Guess the weekend got ahead of them, and when you are out, you are out.  I was happy they serve Kaliber non alcohol beer which is my favorite.  The menu isn't large but offers a interesting selections.  We ordered the cheese balls and WOW are they delicious.  This isn't your ordinary mozzarella cheese stick like balls.  The waiter said the cheese is made locally and had a soft, salty and tangy bite.  I enjoyed the pork tacos that were so good I would have them again.  My man had the hamburger advertised as one of the best in Pittsburgh - he agrees."
"3","A great choice but we should have heeded the advice of the waiter. The bacon burger was delicious and the Mac and cheese was as great as touted. The pork burger was good overall but it lacked a nuance flavors. The advice that we should have heeded was to avoid the French fries. Just stick to their specifically touted items and you'll have a good experience."
"5","Awesome place to check out after taking the incline and checking out the view! Got here on a weekday a little after happy hour and was promptly seated outside. \n\nOur waitress was super friendly and attentive and had us ordering more drinks and food then we should have but it was worth it! \n\nThe menu seems overwhelming at first as it looks like there are huge descriptions of each item that may or may not inform of what the dish really consists of! My bf and I ended up sharing a couple of appetizers (sriracha deviled eggs and sliders) and ordered the mac and cheese with jerk chicken to share. Everything was delicious but the mac and cheese was amazing! Soo good! Really i think the mac and cheese here with anything will be amazing!\n\nWe also started off with a couple of beers then we ordered a couple of rounds of the frozen cosmo. The frozen cosmos are super strong and delish. The fact that they are frozen makes it so refreshing on a hot summer day/night. Add a $1 and you can add more alcohol to it so be careful with these drinks! They might hit you hard if you have too many!\n\nTo finish things off we were convinced to get a hot cookie in a small cast iron pan loaded with ice cream! The cookie was ooey gooey and delicious.\n\nI had an awesome night here and would love to come back for more delicious food and drinks!"
"4","Great find!  Visiting from DC and loved the unique take on menu!  Witty and original.  The food was excellent! Can't say enough about the pierogi sliders and the eggplant lasagna!!"
"2","I'm only giving this 2 stars instead of 1 because of the way Jim handled our problem. This review is mainly based on service and not food. \n\nMy boyfriend and I were told to go to the shiloh grill from a friend. We got here and it was a 45 minute wait, which is fine so we waited. After 45 minutes we were seated by the hostess. Our server never, NEVER asked us what we wanted to drink. Not once throughout our whole meal. He told us there would be a girl following him for training and that was all he said. We told him we'd like an appetizer and told him which one. He said they were all out. We picked another one, he said they were out of that too. We picked a third appetizer - surprise! Out of that too. We asked him what they weren't out of and he said their Hush Piggies so we ordered that as we were starving and wanted an appetizer. 35 minutes later, still no appetizer. A woman (the manager at the time, though she never said she was or even said her name) came up to us laughing and said \""your order was the last order we had and it got burnt so we can't give it to you, but we'll take it off the bill\"" -obviously you will take it off. She asked if we wanted anything else and we asked when our food would be out (why order an app if it's been 35 minutes and the food should be out shortly?) she said it would be out momentarily. We said we'd pass on the appetizers so she walked away. A few minutes later our waiter came to say he'd pushed our food to the front so it would be out next. No. Another 35 minutes for our meal, so we were obviously mad we didn't order another app. Nonetheless, I ordered a turkey burger and he ordered a mushroom burger. Definitely nothing that should take an hour. At this point we had yet to complain once but i'm sure our annoyance was obvious. I wanted to speak with the manager but she was in the bar on her cellphone talking to two guys for 20 minutes as we could see into the bar. We waited for our bill but it never came for 15 minutes when Jim talked to us. Jim is the entire reason I didn't give the place one star. He should be running the place, really. He was awesome. He came up to us (meanwhile he had just walked in and wasn't even there during our whole ordeal!). He told us our whole meal was being comp'd, apologized immensely, and told us to order dessert. We did, the dessert was good but pretty sure it was nuked as it was cold in many spots and warm in others. We didn't complain because at this point, oh well. He then came back after we had finished our desert and Jim came up to us giving us the owner's business card and a $20 gift certificate to come back again. We both decided we will never come back for a meal (the food was decent, but not worth all this trouble) but would come back and spend it at the bar. It's a shame that the service gave them this review, but if it wasn't for JIm they'd only have 1 star. If the owner or management reads this, Jim needs a raise and the girl manager who was working on 4/16 needs a demotion and her cell phone should be put away during a shift. So unprofessional."
"5","Wow, this place is outstanding! We felt a little under dressed, seeing as though it was a Saturday evening and everyone was fairly dressed up, but no one made us feel like we should have dressed more formally. Our waiter was great, he knew EVERYTHING about the dishes on the menu, and recited a specials menu that was so long, I lost track of the many mouthwatering specials that he described in detail. Our drinks were fantastic, and the seafood was heavenly. My party finished off the meal with Irish coffees, and they were so strong (whiskey wise) that he had to warn us as he set them down. My Irish nuts and berries ( a cream chamboard drink) was so strong it made my head spin (in a good way). Very expensive, but very much worth it."
"4","Yet another business dinner and yet another night of eating WAY too much food!  It's a rough life, I know.  Pity me...\n\nOne of THE most spectacular views of the city, bar none.  Most of the dining room has great/good views through the enormous windows, but I would even recommend the little bar downstairs for a drink and some great views.  Seemed to be not so well known, and a cheaper night than spending on the whole meal.\n\nWhat can I say, the food was fantastic.  The Seared Ahi tuna was delicious with just the right amount of wasabi flavoring.  I ordered the salmon special on a cedar plank that was cooked and flavored absolutely right.  Even the steak was delicious according to some of my table-mates.\n\nWine list was generous (a bit pricey) but well complimenting the meals.  The serving staff was a touch slow, but it was nice not to feel rushed.\n\nTIP:  Try their pretzel bread rolls.  They're delicious!\n\nBIGGER TIP:  Not really sure about parking here, (I think there was valet service) but if you take a taxi there like we did, be prepared.  On a cold, snowy night we were waiting a good 45 minutes for a return taxi to the city.  Make sure to get your cab driver's number on the way over.  Give him an estimated time that you'll be done, and call him before dessert.  You'll save yourself a load of trouble. \n\nAbsolutely a place to take clients/business dinners.  A little pricey, but the food and atmosphere will definitely impress.  It's a little out of the way, but still only a 10 minute cab ride from the Convention Center"
"4","By far, probably the the best maryland style crab cakes ever. I've tried several other places including ones in Manhattan (where I live now) and no one can beat their crab cakes. The taste, texture and consistency is hands down the best I've had.  It's also a good portion so you're not left hungry.  \n\nThe fish is also pretty fresh and the dishes are delicious though as I recall, the fish dishes were uninspiring, offering very little creativity. The ingredients didn't jump out at me. Presentation and ambience is great for Pittsburgh, offering great views of the city. Nice place to take clients or your date. Next to the Original Fish Market in downtown, this is the only place I go for seafood in Pittsburgh because they do it right."
"5","First off, the food is absolutely amazing.  A must visit. Plus the view is spectacular.  But tonight, my review is about the customer service - stellar.  There were a few mishaps with the meal, but if there was ever a way to salvage a mistake, MB did it with flying colors.  The management handled everything perfectly.  But the real applause goes to Jessica, who works in the lounge.  She is on her game, knows how to treat a customer, and, well, is VERY easy on the eyes...  She's the reason I'll definitely be going back.\n\nGreat food, great view, and amazing customer service."
"4","Delicious Italian cuisine.  I had an 8 cut neapolitan pizza with mushrooms and pepperoni.  I'm a sucker for pizza, but the other four people I was with had other specials that I tried as well and all of the dishes were excellent.  Oh, also, they had delicious complimentary garlic bread that they were very generous with.\n\nReservations are a must; this place has gotten so popular that you can't just walk in anymore.  We saw at least one group of three get turned away at a little after 9pm.  Plan on spending a good deal of time here as the atmosphere is very relaxed, there are only a few waitstaff, and the kitchen is very busy and only has a few chefs.\n\nThis place is BYOB (where B = beer, or bottle) and they do have a cork fee.  It is $5 for a .75 liter, $7 for a 1.5 liter (or larger, I assume) and I can't remember, but I want to say $5 for each six-pack.  They will bring out an ice bucket for you to keep the alcohol cold, but we saw many people who had their own little coolers.  One person I was with said her family brought a cooler on wheels once and the staff was totally fine with it.  It really is very relaxed.\n\nMy only complaints about the place were that it was very dark and the decor was lacking, but this restaurant is definitely no frills, no nonsense, and bare bones in order to keep the overhead to a minimum.  Also, the specials on the menu don't have explanations underneath them, so you'll have to listen to the waiter/waitress when they describe what they are.  Valet parking is pretty necessary for the area and costs $3.  Overall, highly recommended!"
"5","I dined here with several colleagues earlier this year.  I have little to say other than the service was flat-out fantastic and the food was top-notch.\n\nThe owner went out of his way to help us obtain some wine for the table since all the stores were closed (my working assumption is that someone working at the restaurant \""dontated\"" it), as well as some very special personal assistance in helping us get back to our hotel when taxi service was unreliable.\n\nThe food, wow.  I have not had calamari quite like they did it before or since, and it was fantastic.  I don't remember what I ordered for my main, but do remember not being disappointed.  Our table got quite a sampling of things and everyone was pleased, so I'm not sure you can go too wrong with the Italian fare.\n\nHighly recommended."
"3","We ate here in July and although I am a fan of the food-I think this place runs a bit of a scam...\n\nFrom what I can tell, they basically sell wine, although they claim to have someone run down the street or what have you.  So you pay them and tip them but no real running down the street ever happens.  I bet they have boxes of it back there.  That said, it's still probably cheaper than buying it.\n\nThe service here I would describe as mixed.  We went on a night when it was DEAD.  It was just us and a few other people finishing up.  It was a Weds and it must have been about 9pm when we were seated.\n\nI can't recall our servers name after all that time, but he was a bit of a know it all.  If you get this guy you will know it...he will basically \""suggest\"" this and that...but these aren't suggestions, he will probably poison you if you don't follow them.  I am only half joking.  He \""suggested\"" only the most expensive stuff on the menu-but for me it was all good.  It was a great meal with a good friend I rarely see, but it was a little intimidating.  I actually think this guy deserves a good beating...god knows how many people he has done this to.  The pastas, the apps and the entrees were all, for me, solid to excellent.  If it was just on the food I would give them 5 stars, but the guy was a total ass...and I wouldn't eat here again.  I would rather eat at an ok restaurant (food wise) with great service than the opposite.  Our check was pretty steap, which is ok and we tipped Mr. recommendation well, but I can't endorse the place because of this.  Don't get me wrong-it was good enough to overlook the service as long as you can ensure you don't get this guy.  I don't know how to do that though, and I don't like being strong armed by anyone...least of all by some guy who brings me my food and is supposed to let ME decide.  Capiche?"
"1","I thought I'd already reviewed this hole, but it just seems I'd written a tip warning everyone to stay away. So I'll write a review to stay away. Just stay away, bad food, don't come here, move on. \n\nTo be totally serious, I've had the food twice, once in house, the previous time it was take out. I ordered the vegetable fried rice for the take out meal. Seemed overly salty and lacked the umami essence. Which leads to the time I ate in...\n\nLord, my chicken tasted like ammonia, I ordered the lemon chicken with brown rice. Seriously my diced chicken not only had the flavor of ammonia but smelled like a bottle of Windex. The waiter (owner,chef?) came over to see if me and my date were okay, I told him the chicken tasted funny. My date said the sweet and sour pork tasted fine. He took my chicken away. Then came back and asked me if I wanted something else from the beef or pork section of the menu. Whoop Whoop Whoop!!! Danger! Danger Will Robinson!! That set my mind in gear that he took chicken off the menu that fast. I played it safe and ordered vegetable fried rice (this might have been the reason I turned vegan!) \n\nI paid the bill and left, never to return! Blech!"
"5","Samosas are crispy, slightly spicy and potato-filled. Delicious for a whopping price of $1. Also a great place to buy spices. Wasn't sure where to find turmeric powder but I found it here."
"1","You ever work back of the house at a suburban chain restaurant? Picture that disgusting dish rack. The greasy ass floors. You crawl out like a slug at the end of your slimy shift.\n\nThat's this place.\n\nIt might be the setup--kitchen at the front and clogged lunch line blocking the door. It could be the low ceilings and wobbly cafeteria tables. It's possibly the abundance of grimy college kids taking a study break. No offense college kids, but your grimier activities elsewhere leave you thinking this is a safe haven. It's not.\n\nThe sandwiches are not good enough to justify how dirty you feel when you leave. So order to go? They take away your fries.\n\nBottom line: avoid this place. Spend an extra 20 minutes and catch the 61C towards the cleaner location in squirrel hill."
"4","College bar staple with great half-price food, a large menu, and excellent beer specials."
"3","I've been here 10+ times since my last review so I thought I should update. First, their long island pitcher is really great! Actually, all of their shots pitchers seem tasty! I love how they add those gummy worms. By the time your drink is done, they have sucked up a good amount of alcohol ;) \n\nFor food, I would recommend the pulled pork grilled cheese. It's my favorite thing on their menu and I've tried many things! I also enjoy their buffalo chicken wrap. The pulled pork wrap was also tasty. It comes with cole slaw on(in?) it.\n\nHalf priced food after 9pm can't be beat!  \n\nI know one day I'll be older and Hem's won't be \""my thing\"", so I'm gonna enjoy it while I can. Just remember it's a college bar and can get loud! I have even became annoyed with the noise level a few times and im your average 23 year old :)"
"4","There is no doubt this place is beautifully breathtaking,  but the catering is little to be desired.  We attended the Military Ball last night and the venue definitely set the stage.  The venue gets 5 stars.  My only issue was the food.  It was terrible.  I felt like I was eating dog food. Beef tips on rice with bland potatoes and green beans... When you think beef tip for a fancy sit down dinner you expect more than 3 pieces of smaller then bite size beef. I definitely was not happy."
"1","I don't know how you screw up a grilled vegetable sandwich on focaccia bread, but they managed to do it. Slimey, undercooked with no flavour. Pizza was too bready. I wouldn't bother with this place. I don't even know how they call this Italian food, just bec. they put tomato sauce on it?"
"1","1/2 price food - Yes.\nalcohol - yes\nitalian food - yes\n\nThat's all there is to say about this place. The food here is meh.... I've tried their pizza which is ok. I usually get the spaghetti and meatballs which is a half pound meat ball. And it's just 1 which pissed me off. You could at least put like 2 half pound meatballs on my plate. Seriously."
"1","Spinach wrap for lunch was disgusting. Weird, pasty sauce. Whole place seems kind of dirty. Booths need to be wiped down. Don't go here unless you're an undergraduate with low standards."
"2","Typical college restaurant. Food was mediocre for me but a good choice for college kids.  Had the pizza and the artichoke dip.  It was recommended at not that good."
"4","While passing through Pittsburgh to visit colleges, my parents and I decided to stop at Joe Mama's for dinner. While the restaurant's walls adorned with many celebrities' signatures make one assume it is a restaurant of extremely high quality, it was nothing special. The calamari that we ordered was good, but fairly salty, and the bruschetta was overly sweet. The entrees were much better, but the pizza was slightly on the greasy side. Their chocolate cobbler was good, and one desert could easily be shared among the three of us. While it was not a bad meal, it wasn't a place I would expect seeing anyone special in, as the walls seem to claim."
"2","This food at this place is not good. I really wanted to like this place - the atmosphere is nice, service seems fine, and there's never a wait even at half price time (although I guess I know why) but both times I came here the food was just bad.\n\nThe first time I came here it was for lunch and I got a vegetarian spaghetti dish with vegetables (that I now no longer see on their menu hmm...) and while it was tolerable it was by no means good. It was really lacking flavors and the vegetables just felt thrown in. \n\nThe second time I came here for dinner and got the gnocchi and this one was really bad - almost inedible. Normally I can scarf down the food if I am hungry enough, but after a few pieces of this I really couldn't eat it. It's somewhat difficult to describe what was wrong with it - the sauce had a very strong flavor and it wasn't a good one.\n\nSince I clearly didn't enjoy the food, the last time I came here was a while ago. I would be willing to come back to see if the quality has changed since I last showed up since the menu does appear a bit different. I would definitely not get a pasta dish though."
"5","Just had the best spinach pie in my life, so fresh and garlicky! Jb and the inlaws all had chicken tandoori and each were raving about it. I tasted the basmati rice which was light & fluffy and sooo full of flavor.  Salims catered a friends wedding last year andthere were absolutely no complaints. Salims is amazing!  Can't wait to go back!!"
"1","Racist racist racist. I came on a Wednesday for pizza for the first time and the cook decided that it was okay to to start spewing racial slurs and making references thinking I wouldn't hear him. Gross."
"2","Lulu's has two things going for it: it's cheap, and it's close to Carnegie Mellon's campus. Besides that, the service isn't great, they have forgotten my food, and the food isn't that great. I keep going back because up until recently, there wasn't any other choice that close to campus for quick Asian food. \r\n\r\nThe items are hit or miss, and lackluster. Good luck. I'm not saying it's horrible, it's just uninspired, boring, and not that flavorful."
"1","Blek! Not only did the server take 15+ minutes to take our order, I had a crusty fork, and the salt shaker on our table had a dried noodle attached to it. I've had way better Asian food, and worked in Irvine, CA for ten years, so my standards are high, admittedly. My Ma Po Tofu tasted like it came out of a can. My friend's veggie Pho had bland soup base, and canned mushrooms, that's a killer for me right there.\n\nIf you want really good Pho, go to Tram's or Pho Mihn on Penn in Lawrenceville. For suburb sushi, try Chaya in Sq. Hill. And for good Korean, go to Sushi Kim's in the Strip.  In fact, I think any Asian place in Pittsburgh, would be better than going here. \n\nOr just save a few bucks, and get a package of Ramen at the grocery store and add an egg to it. Even that's better than the so called noodles at Lu Lu's!"
"3","This place just gives off mediocrity like a bad stench.  It was bustling when I stopped by here recently for lunch - must be the decent prices, quick service, large portions, and central location.  Lulu's is not a bad place, don't get me wrong, just don't expect authenticity or anything beyond normal Americanized Asian fast food.  I had the Friday lunch special - the \""chicken wing appetizer\"" or whatever was noooo good, and consisted of 2 wings placed awkwardly on the same platter as me overdrenched beef szechuan.  Or, what I thought was supposed to be beef szechuan.  The funny thing is, there was no spice kick to it whatsoever.\n\nThe redeeming quality was my friend's seaweed salad, which was delicious!  Covered in yummy sesame oil.  I'm sure there are other hidden gems on the menu, but I didn't find any.  Come here if you're in the mood for a huge MSG kick during your class lunch break, if you're short on time or money, or if you just want to avoid the even-worse places in the area."
"1","Terrible food!  I do cut this place some slack in that it's in a very busy college area of town and it's supposed to have quick food for cheap.  However, the food here is terrible.  The menu is huge (that's not good) and everything is high unauthentic.  How can you advertise something like pho on the menu and have it taste and look nothing like the dish from which it bares its name???  Noodle soup does not equal hot water (no flavor) and noodle plus some questionable pieces of meat.  I've gotten sick from eating other \""Chinese\"" dishes here.  Overall, the food is just questionable."
"4","I love the lunch specials, esp. the Thursday one that comes with an eggroll, ...good prices, and the soup/hot tea is great comfort food for when you're trying to keep warm and fight off a cold."
"2","The growing number of noodle restaurants is a positive trend but is jeopardized by those who do not put honest effort into it.  I don't know what bouillon can they open to make their broth, but they need to get a stock pot and some bones."
"2","Everything is over-sweet. No resemblance of real Asian food."
"1","If you're looking for any semblance of \""authentic Asian food\"" then turn around and run the other way. Never have I been so disappointed by an Asian restaurant-- seriously, even Oriental Express is more authentic than the shit they serve here. Every single time I ordered a noodle dish, I've been shown a new way in which that food could be horribly disgraced. Overpriced, overrated, and I absolutely abhor the decor. \n\nThe decor is cheesy as hell-- why do I want to look at stock photo images of people touching my noodles in ways that violate all kinds of health codes? It just makes me wonder what passes as \""sanitary\"" in their kitchen. [And other colorful imagery of people rubbing noodles on various body parts]\n\nPad Thai: a sad pile of overcooked rice noodles with a wretched, bland peanut sauce that sits on the noodles to create that sad dog shit dish you've always wanted. The exact opposite of an authentic pad thai dish. Pathetic doesn't even begin to describe it. I could smear peanut butter on dried ramen noodles and get a better experience.\n\nPho: well how could you really expect this place to create a beef consomme-esque broth with authentic viet flavors? Awful. I can't even.\n\nMy review may be slightly inaccurate because I haven't been there since people lied to my stupid freshman dorm about how great this place is, but if it hasn't changed since then RUN AWAY. GO TO ROSE TEA. OR ANYWHERE ELSE. SUBWAY. QUIZNOS. SAVE YOURSELF MONEY AND BOWEL TROUBLES."
"4","This is an addendum to a previous review (which was filtered for no reason). But, let me tell you, Thrifty's is starting to learn (not completely) the trick. Instead of using pins to secure their tags, this last group of shirts I just dropped off (n=20) all had the tags wrapped around the shirts tag and stapled at the ends (thus not wasting a pin and not putting a hole in the shirt! the only thing is they have yet to do this through a buttonhole which would be the next level of great). I think this is the one folks."
"3","I have had things tailored and dry cleaned here. Dry cleaning is fast and cheap, but everything smells like old people when they are done. \n\nThe tailoring was cheap, but one of the stitches fell out after about a week :(\n\nI've had better, but not really cheaper."
"4","D & A's is my go-to place for ice cream in Oakland.  Although it's not the best ice cream I've ever had, they have the best regular non soft-serve ice cream I've had in PGH to date.  Like other reviewers, I definitely recommend getting the waffle cone--it's delightfully crunchy, light, and sweet, not to mention freshly-made.\n\nIn terms of flavors, I'd recommend the chocolate chip cookie dough and the birthday cake.  I wouldn't call myself a huge cookie dough ice cream fan, but I really enjoyed their version, due to the high cookie dough: ice cream ratio.  I was skeptical about the birthday cake flavor, but I tried it out of curiosity, and it was great!  It has sprinkles, frosting, and cake all mixed together.  Try a sample if you're uncertain (that's what I did), but I think you'll like it! 4.5 stars."
"5","Nothing beats the Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough ice cream.  The cookie dough is always soft and fresh and never too hard or frozen.\n\nGet it all on a in-house made waffle cone with an M&M on the bottom.  The best part is that the M&M always ends up a bit melty from the warmth of the fresh made cone."
"3","went there for the first time for lunch today. The weekday lunch crowd is pretty big but the service is fast and friendly so they seem to turn tables over pretty quickly. \n\nMy table split an order of Hummus and I had the small order of cabbage leaves (ground lamb). The meal was fine, light and fresh tasting. I was surprised how inexpensive it was...less than $5. Would totally go back for another lunch run since I work in the area."
"2","Good recipes, nice atmosphere, and an interesting menu are frequently ruined by inattentiveness in the kitchen.  Meats are often dry, tough, and overcooked, though the vegetarian options are still delicious.  Ali Baba is a place with a lot of potential, but it needs more skilled professionals behind the curtain.\n\n(Also, the water glasses are unusually small, requiring many refills and usually causing periods without water during a meal--you can ask for a bigger one, though, something I didn't learn until my third visit.)"
"1","Got moussaka. Instead of bechamel, they put american cheese on top...interesting, cheap and not a tasty choice. So much lamb on the menu, it's hard to avoid. Just because it has lamb in it, doesn't mean its Mediterranean. Friend had beef platter. Beef too dry, too well done. For this price, you could get a lot better. Would not recommend"
"3","I was so so happy with this place. Amazing Lobster Malabari, fantastic bread and then: they sent me their crab Malabari.  \n\nAt 15.00 dollars a serving, I expect crab in my crab curry. I did not receive that. I received  that cheap, fake pollack you buy for a couple dollars a packet at the grocery.\n\n It was such a shame... like dressing a beautiful woman in a paper sack because the sauce as always was outstanding. So: If you are willing to accept a subpar experience for a overly priced entree, be my guest I just wanted to save everyone from some disappointment."
"1","What happened? They have to have a new owner) because the prices are still high, and the food was AWFUL. First of all: I waited 3 hours for my meal. It came cold, there was no spice) I ordered a 7) and the delivery guy forgot my soda I paid for, and acted like it wasn't a problem and told me \""Maybe next time\"" I tried to call, I guess they closed for the night because noone picked up or they are busy. I'm kind of offended.... wow. Okay, that's it for me, and the worst review I've ever written."
"3","If you're in Oakland with friends who are divided on drinking vs. eating, Fuel and Fuddle is a good compromise: big beer selection to satisfy the drinkers, and plenty of food options to keep the eaters happy.\n\nThe portions here are really generous.  While not listed directly on the menu, you can request a side of just sweet potato fries (instead of the mix of regular and sweet potato fries), and the plate you get is huge.  The pizzas here are pretty good, with thin crusts that are nicely chewy.  The dessert portions here are the largest I've ever seen--the brownie is about three or four times larger than the typical bar brownie and the nutter butter pie is the tallest peanut butter pie I've seen.  I like how Fuel and Fuddle tried to put its own twist on the apple turnover with the apple \""burnover\"" by using pizza dough instead of puff pastry.  The dough itself, however, could have been more sweet--even with warm apple filling inside, the chocolate sauce drizzled on top, and the vanilla ice cream, I felt the dessert lacked something.\n\nAs other reviewers have said, this isn't a place to go to if you want to have conversations.  In a party of six, I had to stick to talking to the people right next to me, and even then I felt like I was nearly shouting.  The food and drinks here aren't bad at all, but not quite enough to convince me to frequent this place if I'm not already in Oakland."
"3","This place wasn't as good as we were expecting.  My pizza (Classic Maggie) was good, but nothing outstanding.  My husband's burger was completely charred and basically inedible.  We didn't bother sending it back as our waitress was nowhere to be found.\n\nIt's your typical bar food with a decent beer selection...nothing more, nothing less."
"2","It's basically a loud, dimly-lit sports bar that serves cheap, greasy 1/2 finger food after 11pm. Nothing really stood out and, again, the food was really greasy. \n\nMeh. Go if you have midnight munchies and you want cheap food."
"1","My husband and I went to Fuel and Fuddle based purely on the fact that it was open late and we were starving after our movie.  The thought that first struck me when I arrived was that the floor was covered in trash; dirty napkins, straws, french fries, and who knows what else.  \n\nWe were seated at a small table and the backs of the booth seats were cinder blocks--not comfortable at all.  Then we were handed sticky menus, which prompted the use of hand sanitizer after handling.  When I asked the waitress for recommendations she basically said everything on the menu was great (definitely hard to believe).  \n\nAs for the food, my husband ordered a margheritta pizza, which came out burnt to a crisp on one side but otherwise was fairly good.  I ordered the nachos, which were covered in burnt cheese, huge chunks of unripe tomatoes, a few black olives and half a carton of sour cream.  Both entrees looked very unappealing; I ate about four nachos before pushing the plate aside.  \n\nOut of the entire disastrous evening, the service gets the prize for very worst.  After the food arrived we never saw our waitress again and waited twenty minutes for our check.  My husband finally had to get up to look for her and found her texting in the back.  We ended up not leaving a tip, a definite first for us.  \n\nIf your looking for a late night bite to eat, do yourself a favor and go across the street to Primanti Brothers."
"1","Avoid! Now I know why all of the positive reviews said great late night place. You need to have a drunken buzz to enjoy the food. We were 0 for 4 on dinners. BBQ chicken pizza crust was burned and lacked flavor. The pulled pork was dried out, tough and lacked taste. Buffalo Mac n cheese was too thick tasted like they just dumped Frank's Red Hot Sauce in. Lastly, the jerk chicken was too jerky. Waitress took our order and didn't check on us or offer to get more drinks."
"1","DO NOT GO THERE. I lost 6 inches of my hair because of this place!! I went there for the first time and had my hair done with Tee. I asked for an ombre with darker roots (my hair is dark brown) and I already had highlights on. I spent 4 hours there and my hair came out ORANGE with red roots! I looked absolutely awful and it wasn't anything close to what I asked for. I went back an hour later and asked them to fix my hair. Spent more 4 hours at the salon and left looking even worse. My hair started to fall out while I was at the salon and they did absolutely nothing! I left there with my hair falling out and looking absolutely terrible. They literally cooked my hair, and I lost 6 inches of it! I went to a different place on the next day and all the hairstylists were terrified with what happened to my hair and said they had never seen worse job in their lives. It was all damaged and the color was so ugly. I had 6 inches of my hair cut off and I used to have really long, pretty hair. Now my hair is half of its old length because of Mark and Anthony Salon. Not only that, but when I called they said it would cost $60, I ended up paying $150! I asked for a refund and they gave it to me right away, but they can never give me my hair back or all the money I had to spend at the new salon and with all the products I have to use it now to fix what they did. It's going to take about an year for my hair to grow out and not to be damaged anymore. I've never regretted something as much as going to that place. By any means, do not go there if you care about your hair. Don't make the same mistake I did."
"2","COOL:\n- Plenty of seating.\n- Plenty of power.\n- Full of activity.\n- Free wifi if you have AT&T Wireless at home.\n\nUNCOOL:\n- Long lines.\n- No breakfast sandwiches.\n- Bathroom requires a key?  I guess that's typical Starbucks."
"3","This is a standard business hotel. It is a bit run down. The hotel is close to Carnegie Mellon University (~1 mile) and also close to University of Pittsburgh. They see a lot of service and it is a busy hotel. The rooms are quite large and the beds are comfortable and large. \n\nThe rooms have free internet and the speed is OK. The internet is wired in the rooms but wireless in the lobby. \n\nThey hotel does not really have to do much to attract given their location, which in some respects is reflected in their service. The service is not bad but generic business type service."
"2","I went here once because one of the Pitt clubs was doing a fundraiser here, and I'm not sure if it was just this location, but I wasn't impressed. \n\nI got a pumpernickel bagel with plain cream cheese. The bagel was thin and pretty bland. There was barely any cream cheese on there, and what WAS there was poorly spread around. \n\nThe location is good and it's cheap, but you'd have better luck going to Einstein's bagels, or even getting a Panera bagel- instead."
"3","A convenient local deli which quickly serves up both hot and cold sandwiches. It's open late."
"3","I admit that its nickname (\""OK\"") made me smirk. Whoever christened it hit the nail right on the head.  This restaurant is above threshold, but only just.\n\nIts menu is classic Cantonese. The food is, on the whole, competently prepared. It's a good compromise between American-Chinese takeout and some more authentic flavors (e.g., a fish steamed in its entirety, head and all).  \n\nThe quality/quantity to price ratio is not super. For example, the \""fried duck with taro stuff\"" [sic] came with more taro \""stuff\"" than duck. The pieces are served atop a big mound of shredded cabbage to make the plate seem more plentiful than it actually was.  The taste is good, but I'm not sure if it's $15 good. The fried tofu and scallop balls had more tofu than scallops, and the scallops were not of the best quality.  The whole fish, though I like it, is too expensive for what it is ($24 for flounder; $30 for sea bass). \n\nThe service is prompt and, in its own way, friendly. There is no ambiance to speak of, though that's not what people come here for. I have some reservations about the cleanliness of the kitchen (it has the look of LA restaurants that get B or C on their hygiene grade cards[*]), but I'm not so worried as to not eat here.\n\nSummary: Comparing \""OK\"" with other nearby Chinese restaurants, I think I prefer Rose Tea and Ka Mei a smidgen more.\n\n[*] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restaurant_rating#Sanitation."
"1","The waitress/owner is the worst I have ever experienced.  Sure, her English is bad, but her attitude is worse.\nI went in with allergies/a cold after 3pm. yesterday evening, hoping to get a soup to comfort me.  She tossed the menus on the table remarking that she was doing me a favor by placing the lunch menu on the table, even when lunch was technically over.\nShe went away and chatted in Chinese with the nearby table.  \nShe came back to my table and I wasn't ready.  It took her 10 minutes to return.  She turned up her nose at me, and began chatting (loudly) with the sushi chef.  My body language showed I was ready, but she came over when she was good and ready.\n\nI said that I wanted soup, and asked her for her recommendation, since I was feeling under the weather.  I guess she was disappointed in my order.  She refused to apply herself to the question, giving short, sharp answers, avoiding eye contact, and then stating, \""Everyone is different,\"" so a recommendation was not possible.  She left again for an extended period of time.  I had time to look around at the dirty carpet.  She brought no tea or water.\n\nI asked about the spring rolls; were they fried?  She tried to educate me on Chinese cuisine versus Thai with such attitude.  \""Excuse me?\"" I thought to myself, \""Does Orient equate with Chinese?\""\n\nI asked if she had ginger tea.  She said there was only one tea in a yelling tone, and I had better be okay with that!\n\nFinally I ordered the Miso soup.  It came in a very small bowl and was not hot enough.  I asked for the tea twice, since it appeared she did not hear me.  She barked at me with the equivalent, \""Alright already.\""  She plopped it on the table.  Later, when I was finished with my soup, she put her fingers all over the tea nossle.  That was effective in making me leave promptly.  Again, my body language communicated, \""Check please!\"" but she chatted with the sushi chef, never letting him get a word in edgewise.\n\nI waited another agonizing 5 minutes for the check and left a 1cent tip.  I mumbled \""Never again!\"" as I left, determined to never frequent this establishment, and to discourage all of my friends and family to steer clear.  As I drove around the back, the kitchen staff stared at me in an unwelcoming manner.\n\nI had never had such an experience at a restaurant in my life before."
"2","The lady who runs the service here is extremely rude. Pretty sure she's only not rude to people who speak Cantonese. For every little thing we asked her, she started scolding us in Mandarin.\n\nI came here once with a large group and my friend and I were ordering for everyone. We were just discussing possible dishes to get and she wrote down everything we said even though we haven't actually ordered it. We didn't realize this until the food was brought out. We didn't want to argue with her so ended up paying for everything.\n\nWe also thought we ordered too much and just wanted to ask if we could take a dish off the order. She started yelling at us when we were only asking if it was possible. Extremely bad attitude and very obnoxious.\n\nThe food here is also not that great. A lot of the dishes we ordered was pretty flavorless. And I'm talking about their \""authentic\"" dishes, not their Americanized ones. Their salt and pepper squid was good, though it's hard to mess that up. Can definitely get better authentic Chinese food elsewhere.\n\nThey also cater for large parties in their upstairs dining area. Do not do this. They overcharge for parties by serving subpar food and charge a certain price per person."
"4","Nellie's brings a much needed respite from regular ol' sandwiches, soups and pizza that pervade the Oakland lunch scene. \n\nMy recent favs are the falafel and tabouli. Oooh, that tabouli... so flavorful with the parsley and citrus, man it's good on a ripped pita section! Recent dislike is the hummos; I find it too \""Earthy.\"" The service is nice and typically prompt, they accept cards (there's a minimum charge amount), and the location is a plus for those of us who work at the top of the hill. Stop in, and give some local business owners your patronage!"
"2","I ordered a chicken salad from this place last night and it was below average. The chicken was warm, but definitely not hot. And the french fries on the salad were cold. \n\nWhile the portion size was quite large, it was     a very poor product. The only reason I ordered from this place is because it is pretty cheap (even cheaper with a coupon code on Grubhub), but it definitely wasn't worth the $7 I paid."
"1","This place is a disappointment. It took 2 hours to get my pizza, when they told me 45 minutes to an hour. I was told the first time the driver was leaving in 2 minutes, and I was his only stop. It took another 50 minutes to get to my house. I live about 10 minutes away. When it finally got to my house after three calls and two hours, it was cold. When I put it in the microwave, it wasn't even good warm pizza. The Pizza was okay at best, just not worth a 2 hour wait. I will avoid this place going forward. Pizza Sola is way better!"
"2","I'm not the best person to ask an opinion about when it comes to McDonalds. In fact I hate it. I quit eating it about ten years ago, that is until someone decided that after they took my order for Burger King and they weren't open that they would run here to get food. LAME.\n\nI wasn't going to be fussy and have a tantrum like a little kid, so I caved and let them bring me food from here. I can guarantee that I ate it like a two year old kid. I picked at it, played with it, complained about it, and if I could have, I would have fed it to a dog. However, I view that as animal cruelty.\n\nI give them kudos for attempting to be festive and mix the grease with leafy greens, but it still comes down to that nasty grease they fry everything in.  That's all my tongue sensed. I hated the food and then myself later that night as I made many trips to the bathroom, cursing each time. \n\nRemember, beggars can't be chooser. So when it comes to McDonalds, panhandle elsewhere."
"5","I usually only get my hair cut once a year because I'm rarely happy with what I end up with. Needless to say I'm pretty picky about who I allow near my hair. I've been to many different salons/stylists in Pittsburgh and am over the moon with Marissa! She listens to what I want and doesn't take it too far like many stylists do. I've gotten both cut and color from Marissa and have been ridiculously happy with both!"
"3","If you're looking for greasy Chinese delivery, look no further.  Two pad thais and two egg rolls came to less than $20.  The pad thais were huge and left more than enough for next-day lunch leftovers.  The egg rolls were pretty greasy but hit the spot.  Not the greatest food I've ever eaten, but sometimes a girl just needs some really greasy noodles.\n\nDelivery available through Meals Delivered. and Campus Food.  (Campus Food is cheaper.)"
"2","I recall walking in and standing right in front of two employees who just continued their convo while I patiently waited to be served. Finally after at least 5 minutes I was addressed and I placed my order. I couldn't tell if the server was unfriendly, if it was merely a cultural thing, or if he just had trouble understanding me. Anyway since I'm giving the benefit of the doubt here, I increased my ranking by one star.\n\nI ordered the beef noodle soup and it was terrible - too spicy and the beef had a weird taste to it. Usually after I leave establishments one of the employees will either say thank you, have a good day or something, but not in this place.\n\nA few things to take into account are that the employees were college age and it was pretty close to closing time so that could have impacted the level of service. All in all I just did not enjoy my experience and I won't be returning."
"2","And my never-ending struggle to find the perfect nail salon continues...\n\nS&T is conveniently located in Oakland.  It's best to call ahead and make an appt, they absolutely give priority to appts over walk-ins (as they should!).  Parking is available on-street at the meters, but being Oakland, you may not find a spot as close as you'd like.\n\nMy pedi was standard.  No massage, and the technician kept stopping what he was doing to glance up at the TV.  All in all, he was done in 25 minutes (not including the nail design).  Not great, not totally awful.  The kicker was waiting over 20 minutes for the polish to dry before the design I requested could be applied.  I've never had to wait that long anywhere else before.  The design was great, though!\n\nLess than a week and I already have chips in the polish:(  No waxing services offered here, either.  $35 for a half-assed pedi with a cool design....eh my search goes on!"
"3","OMG! Finally! A pizza shop that doesn't charge $8 for a head of lettuce and a hand full of veggies. The food is pretty good and very affordable. \n\nThe only problem I have is that my workplace puts in a $300+ order every friday and they never throw out any deals. Not that they have to but it would at least show that they value and appreciate their customers' business."
"4","For a long time, I avoided Qdoba. Really! I always had this idea that the food here was awful, greasy, and just all around bad for me. Well, I was mostly right, but it turns out that Qdoba is not nearly as bad as I thought it would be! In fact, I could easily see it becoming a fantastic occasional treat in my life.\n\nI stopped in and ordered a quesadilla to go and couldn't have been happier. The pulled pork was delicious and I was able to get extra salsa, guacamole and sour cream in little cups on the side, meaning that my main entree wasn't completely slathered in distracting toppings. And I was SO impressed with the staff and assembly line they had going. Despite coming in to find a long dinner line, I was in and out within minutes. Very nice!\n\nI didn't stay to eat here because the layout in the dining area seemed pretty cramped, although I noticed as I was getting ready to leave that there was an upstairs. Any place in Oakland is bound to have space issues sometimes just because of the student lunch/dinner rush. But the layout here did nothing to help the matter; while the staff were able to keep the line moving, there was almost no room to actually accommodate the long line that began forming and snaking through the tiny building. \n\nStill, the food was pretty excellent, even if I had to go elsewhere to get some elbow room while I devoured it. For the record, comparing Qdoba and Chipotle seems pretty apples and oranges given that their menus are only a little similar. So sure, the food is better at Chipotle, but the options aren't NEARLY as diverse. Apples and oranges. A better comparison is Qdoba and Taco Bell, and in that sense Qdoba is truly superior. I mean really, who thinks it's even a contest?\n\nUnfortunately there were no reasonably healthy options here, so I doubt I'm going to be able to become a regular. Once I work off the quesadilla in about a month I'd love to eventually come back and see if the tacos compare - although I admit, when it comes to burritos I do think I'll forever be a Chipotle fan."
"2","The last few times I have been there the staff has been horrible. The don't pay attention and then when I ask again for them to add something I already asked for they give an attitude. The food isn't that great to have to deal with staff that don't care. Chipotle is the better option anyways for fast food Mexican in Oakland."
"5","Just went for wine and dinner with a group of 10 women.  We went for the 1/2 off wine Wednesdays, which makes their reasonably priced wines (I think they have 20 bottles for $22) even cheaper!  \nI was impressed with the food, I had the pumpkin ravioli, and tried the spicy shrimp.  The ravioli were very sweet, but still a nicer dinner dish, and the presentation was great.   Best of all, the service was amazing.  Our waitress even did separate checks.  The restaurant is tastefully decorated, but the bathrooms were a little freaky to me, and the floors were sticky.  \n\nIf you're going to try something here I've also heard rave reviews of the steak medallions on Alfredo and the crab cakes (and just about everything else on the menu)."
"5","Fantastic place.  Amazing food, reasonably priced wine list, great service.  One of my favorite places in the area."
"2","\""Meh\"" is so right on for describing Luma. It's like a diner imitating a classy restaurant. Boring menu that never changes, uninspired cocktail list and a deplorable beer selection. I imagine they must have a lot of freezers for food storage. Servers go through the motions but know better than to give much of a shit. You seriously might as well just go to Eat 'n Park rather than paying moderately high prices for moderately bad food at Luma."
"2","NOTE: A duplicate of a review of this place under a different name.  Just noticed that this place is listed under two different spellings: Grand Canal Cafe and Gran Canal Caffe...\n\nAt first glance, it's a charming little \""neighborhood\"" Italian restaurant.  Nothing fancy.  Simple decor, even a bit cheesy but in a lovable way.  It's comfy.  It's friendly.  You feel quite welcome when you arrive.  It's like dining with friends or extended family members.  \n\nOnce inside, though, we were deflated by the decor.  There are NO windows, and an odd configuration to the two claustrophobic rooms.  The chairs aren't terribly comfortable and there are NO tablecloths.   \n\nBut I didn't let any of that bother me because I had heard the food was terrific.\n\nWe ordered two appetizers to share: cured beef and scallops. Both were delicious.  We ordered the cannelloni and veal piccata.   The cannelloni was good, but nothing special.  The veal dish was average.  \n\nThe biggest disappointment -- and a clue that attention to detail is NOT a specialty -- was the rotten lettuce in the salad.  Not one or two pieces of lettuce, but a good half-dozen in each salad were beyond wilted -- soft and brown.  \n\nWe had gelato for dessert.  It was disappointing.  \n\nThe service was reasonably attentive but ineffective.  We had to ask for water CONSTANTLY!!!!   And, after the first round of drinks before dinner, we were never asked if we'd have liked more.  \n\nOkay, but hey, it's a neighborhood restaurant, right?  Casual, family dining, right?   WAIT!  $110 for dinner for two at a \""neighborhood\"" place?  For THAT kind of tab, I would have liked tablecloths, better service and a more even quality to the food.  \n\nWe might go back, but I'm not sure..."
"1","1. The place was filthy! the window we sat at had algae and/or mold over the entire surface. The ceiling had water damage and had been spottily fixed. (Imagine what you can not see.) \n2. From the time we ordered the soup and salad portion took 40 minutes. Dinner was far over 60 minutes. \n3. We had to get up and find someone to get our drinks refilled for just water and tea. 4. The appetizer orders were half wrong. \n5. One dinner order was wrong. No manager came to talk to us or apologize for a thing. \n6. Potatoes came without sour cream..others came without butter. (which never came)\n7. Staff was not at all friendly or nice. They kept saying they were extremely busy but the dining room had only two tables with customers.....and there were more than 5 servers with at least two boys for busing, so I have no idea what they do when actually busy. \n\nIf you are looking for a nice marina atmosphere try Red Fin Blues Instead. SKIP THIS PLACE COMPLETELY!"
"2","I had pants hemmed here and, while the guy did a decent job (though they still ended up too long even though he pinned them while I had them on?) it was absurdly expensive and took A WEEK.  \n\nCome on now."
"1","There is nothing good to say about this store except that the food is kosher.  There is no customer service.  In fact, most employees are down right rude.  They have the attitude that they are doing you a favor to sell you kosher food - whether it is bad or good, what you need or not, just take it and thank them.  Avoid if at all possible."
"4","Great items, great philosophy."
"5","As many have said, this restaurant easily serves the best authentic Taiwanese food in the Pittsburgh area. I have many Taiwanese friends who drive 2 hours from Ohio just to come here! The food is great, although not absolutely amazing. On the hand, the bubble tea is wonderful. Definitely some of the best I've ever had. Their smoothies are really delicious as well."
"4","Boba (aka Bubble Tea (aka Tapioca)) is fantastic here.\n\nBack in California, we have a boba chain called Tea Station and Ten Ren's.  Theirs is the best I've ever tasted and Rose Tea Cafe is comparable.  \n\nTheir Green Milk Tea (or jasmine milk tea in other places) was the perfect hint of tea.  The consistency was not too thin or thick.  Their actual tapioca balls... I don't recall whether they were exceptional but they weren't bad.  \n\nThe food is pretty good and comes in healthy portions.\n\nNow, the BAD...  the wait is absolutely ridiculous.  If you come around dinnertime- 6p or 7p, you really have to wait an hour for two people.  It's also a very narrow room so the waitresses are constantly tripping around people waiting by the door.\n\nI just advise that you come around 8 or 9p or a lot earlier in the day."
"2","I've been here a few times -- my husband really likes it but for me, I have yet to order an entree that I would order again.  There are only titles on the menu, no descriptions so you kind of have to guess what's in the dish from the titile and sometimes it is just wrong.  I do like the scallion pancake with egg appetizer but the noodle soup that I had the last time we were there was not good at all.  Very bland and with an overabundance of white, wide over-cooked noodles.  I think I'm giving up on the entrees.  If we go again, I'll stick to the scallion pancake and bubble tea."
"3","The food is tasty, but so much MSG!  I'm usually not very sensitive to MSG, but man you can really feel it after you eat here!"
"4","This place is hard to beat for noodle and kimchee dishes.  Excellent milk teas, good smoothies, good prices.  Decent service, in and out quick as can be.  It's not a 5 for me because there's a lot of stuff on the menu that is highly authentic, and I have to admit to ordering several dishes at Rose Tea that I could not believe how much I did not like them.  So unless you really dig the down home asian cooking, stick to the noodle, rice, and kimchee dishes."
"5","One of the few nice Chinese restaurants!"
"2","I read that the Chunk Chicken was awesome, well it wasn't.  $13 for a bowl of chicken???  Yes it came out in less than 5 minutes but there was nothing special about it.  For $13 you think that you would get more than a bowl of rice and $2 worth of chicken.  It was a bunch of semi over cooked chicken.  Nothing visually appealing and the taste, well, it was just OK.  I'll go back to try something else, but this was not the greatest of food everyone on yelp was applauding."
"2","I have been going to this GE for my whole life, and believe me, before they remodeled it, it sucked much more. Still, there are problems. For instance, There are never enough employees working at one time. I have NEVER seen all the lanes open. For a market district that has a million lanes, it's understandable to have 3-4 closed lanes when it is slow. Fine. The Squirrel  Hill Eagle sees lane closings, often leaving only 2 available (not including self-checkout). Ah, but when you do get to a register you can forget about the happy greeting or any greeting at all. I have been told to hurry up by bad-mouthed cashiers who want to go on break. Thought there are a couple great managers (for those that know Sarah who has been there forever), but the rest are surly, unkempt, mean people. \n\nThe stock...what stock? Though their selection on nonperishable is usually fine, you can forget about freshness anywhere but the deli (nice group at the deli). Fish is NOT, I repeat, not fresh. Mold can be found on almost everything in the produce department. I am meat connoisseur and even their top quality beef is a joke (try Fillet Mignon that has the diameter of a silver dollar with heavy marbling). The bakery is above average.\n\nBut...damn is it convenient!! For many older adults and students without cars it is very hard to complain about much more. It's there for good."
"3","My girlfriends and I came here before having a chick's night at the flicks.  We figured why not have some Lebanese chow before seeing an Italian film.\n\nWe started our meals with Loubie Bzeit for our appetizer.  Green beans sauteed with onions, herbs, large whole cloves of garlic (Mmmm!  Kiss me Rick, Darling!).  Since I like the basics, I had the chicken vegetable soup.  To tell you the truth, I prefer chicken noodle any day of the week.  I had my usual here, the grilled turkey salad.  \n\nAladdin's still isn't my first choice for dining out, but it is a nice change of pace from your standard burger joint."
"4","I've heard a lot of people speculating on the authenticity of Aladdin's. I'm not that familiar with Middle Eastern food but everything I've eaten from Aladdin's has been delicious.\n\nThe service has always been great too. It's never been slow or inattentive. My only complaint is I wish they'd give you some complimentary hummus to go with that plain pita they serve every meal. I guess it's a way to get you to order hummus as a starter; you can't say no when there's pita in front of you!\n\nTheir fruit smoothie is smooth and sweet without being overbearing, the inclusion of honey is a nice touch, giving it a bit of added depth.\n\nWhile I cannot comment on the authenticity of their entrees I can say that their desserts are not authentic at all. At the entrance, behind a glass display, are a variety of yummy looking cakes. I'm not one to balk at cake but I wish the display was filled with baklava, jalibeh, and a bunch of other Middle Eastern desserts to fit with the restaurant better.\n\nAuthenticity aside, I can at least say they do better than most Chinese restaurants do when it comes to representing their country's cuisine."
"4","I really like this place. I like their pitza, but I usually go with the falafel salad."
"2","Seriously had to meet the driver at Brillobox, because it was the closest he \""was allowed\"" to get to Larimer/East Liberty. Cried insurance wolf. Honestly, is it still the 80's? (Besides 80's night at the 'Box! Let's be serious here!) Are we not progressive, forward-thinking individuals? East Liberty is TOO SCARY for you? Hey man, I'm hurt. We're all hurt over here. And since we know what it feels like to be hurt, we wouldn't want to hurt you, man. Cause it sucks to be hurt. \n\nWorld change starts with our attitudes."
"5","Based on other Yelp reviews, I chose Homer's for our car inspection.  They were able to get us in within 2 days and were very courteous.  The let me know that everything passed, but we would be needing brakes soon.  I discussed a trip we would be taking to Alabama and they felt that they breaks would hold up fine for the trip.  I appreciate their honesty.  I will be bringing my car back for the work later on."
"1","Worst Chinese food ever. I totally got sick after eating their take-out."
"1","I used to work at the Starbucks across the street from this place, but after a few bites of a friend's General Tso's chicken and the single greasiest mouthful of egg roll I've ever tasted, I refused to order anything but dumplings from this place.  I've seen them pour the dumplings from a bag straight out of the freezer, so I figured the grimy kitchen couldn't infect them too much.  My fried dumplings usually came charred, but I soaked them in sauce and they got me through a lot of closing shifts at the Bucks.  Still, this is the worst Chinese restaurant I've ever been to."
"5","My husband and I came across How Lee restaurant by accident and I wasn't sure what to expect of it at first. I am pretty skeptical about any Asian restaurant in Pittsburgh since I haven't found any 'real' ones like those in New York, Boston and Maryland. \n\nHowever, when seeing big bowls with 'nothing' but chilies, we thought, \""Hey this must be good!\"" We got even more excited when we saw the menu--a ton of Sichuan food to choose from. \n\nDespite the long wait time, we got our table as soon as patrons left and ordered the Chongqing chicken, which turned out to be very popular, and a slightly milder fish dish. It didn't take too long for the food to come despite the busy time. And the food were delicious! We have been to several Sichuan restaurants, and we have to say that How Lee is one of those that we would go back to again and again. :) \n\nSo if you're looking for GREAT Chinese food, check out How Lee! My husband and I look forward to trying other stuff on their menu (oh yeah, they also have non-Sichuan food which seem to be the 'non-spicy' ones.)"
"5","After reading numerous positive, almost glowing reviews her on Yelp, I decided to give How Lee a try.  Boy, am I glad I did.  I stopped by on a Friday afternoon (still able to catch the lunch menu which ends at 3).  Boy, this is the Cantonese food for which I have been searching!\n\nAuthentic, plentiful and tasty!  I chose the Shrimp and Scallops Szechuan Style.  The lunch specials come with your choice of Wonton or Egg Drop or Hot and Sour Soup.  i chose the Hot and Sour Soup which was outstanding, just enough bite at the back of your tongue to remind you why it's called 'hot\"" and sour.  The lunch portions are quite generous.  I took my order to go and there was enough food for a light dinner the next night.\n\nI also chose two traditional eggs rolls.  They weren't bad, just uninteresting.  Perhaps a few water chestnuts or something with crunch would have made them more interesting.\n\nAll in all, excellent Chinese food and I'm sure I will be back often."
"4","Great spicy food. If you like spicy authentic Chinese food this place is as good as those in sf.  Try their Szechwan beef with Mala sauce...if you can take the spice"
"2","We have ordered pizza from here 3 times now (I see your 3 strikes and you're out comment Jen H - funny!) and each time it has gotten WORSE!\nThe last pie (Hawiian) was just last week and it arrived SOGGY all over the bottom! Could not eat it without first trying to crisp it up in oven (failed to work).\n\nI called and the owner answered. FIRST he told me the Hawiian Pizza is ALWAYS like that! OKAAAYYY....  I disputed that and he then said all the ingredients were fresh - I should hope so! THEN he said \""what do you want, a credit? Next time you call,  remind me\"". \n\nI was not feeling well that night or I would have likely fought harder on this issue, possibly even had the driver return, take back the soggy pie and give me my money back! \n\nAVOID this place! Lousy pie, lousier customer service!"
"5","After being disappointed repeatedly by other pizza shops in and around the neighborhood, I decided to give Pizza Amier a try.  Two years later I am still ordering from Pizza Amier and I am never let down!!!  The pizza is great as are the wings, I usually don't stray too far from my usual.  When people ask me about where to get pizza in Squirrel Hill, this is the only place I recommend!!!"
"4","One of the better sushi places I've been to in Pittsburgh!"
"1","I came here only because this place got such great reviews... and i was extremely disappointed.\n\nThe atmosphere is awful, it feels like a cheap dining room. The service is mediocre... we had no soy sauce at our table, so the waitress picked a container of soy sauce up from another table and brought it to us, and it was about 90% emptry so we had to ask for more again...\n\nThe sushi was fresh, but not really creative. I guess this place gets good reviews for having \""fresh fish\"". But why shouldn't a sushi place have fresh fish? I don't think this restuarant should be rewarded for having something it is supposed to have. I don't think I will go back unless i am specifically in the neighberhood."
"5","My wife and I went her New Year's Eve night, 2010. We loved it! The atmosphere and service is fantastic. The staff is dressed very authentically Japanese and loves to interact with their clientele.\nThe food was amazing. I had fried oysters, which are brought out in the shell. There were 5 or 6 on my plate and they were huge and oh so good. They tasted fresh and were excellently fried. My wife got the sashimi variety platter which looked and tasted fantastic. I really have nothing negative to say about this place. Our bill was approx $60 for 2 entrees, two appetizers, twos soups and salads. It was a very nice experience and date!"
"4","Pretty solid Japanese food, I must say. I'm originally from California and I go to school in New York so I've tasted some pretty good Japanese food before and I would definitely say that Chaya is among the top contenders. Is it the best Japanese food I've ever had? No, I wouldn't say that at all. But is it Japanese food that is enjoyable? Yes, I would definitely vouch for that.\n\nI think my slight issue is that I feel like the prices are a bit more on the expensive side. I don't think some of the items on the menu are reasonable at all, but I mean, I suppose they can charge whatever they want since they're one of the better places I've had in Pittsburgh. Service is very nice and always coming by to ask how the food is and if you want any water refills so at least that is good.\n\nIf you want traditional Japanese cuisine in Pittsburgh and you have some money to spare, I would definitely say this is a place to go."
"2","My fiance and I were really excited to try this place because of the Yelp reviews. I'm not sure if everything we chose was not the right thing to choose, but we were pretty disappointed. \n\nWe started with the Sunrise Spider Roll + Fish egg with tempura soft-shell crab and the crab tasted like muddy crawfish. Maybe not the freshest? It was also really expensive for the portion we received. \n\nMisoshiru was very under-salted. \n\nMy unagi kabayaki was full of bones (I'm guessing this is normal; it was my first time having it) and I spent the entire night picking out pin bones with my chopsticks, which actually really improved my chopstick skills. That was a plus.\n\nMy fiance had the broiled black cod, which he said completely saved his entire experience. I tasted it and agreed.\n\nWhy does fried chicken accompany every meal? It didn't really match any of the flavor profiles of any of our dishes, but it was pretty good taste-wise. Not the best fried chicken or anything, but three little nuggets don't hurt when you're given such a small sushi roll portion. \n\nIdeally, I'd like to try a place two more times before reviewing it, but we will definitely not be coming back. \n\nWe've only tried one other sushi place, Plum, and it's definitely our regular place to go. Until we wanted to be adventurous and try other sushi places. \n\nDisappointed. :(\n\nGood points: Really fast service. We were asked how the food was every half-minute and our table was cleared off after each item was complete. It felt a little rushed but we appreciated the customer service."
"2","I come from NY so I have had some good Japanese food. This will be the closest Pittsburgh will ever get to it, and yet something about it just turns me off. It's not the best I've ever had, and yet they charge you as if it is. Maybe the reason I hate this place so damn much is because they're just unnecessarily expensive."
"4","Best sushi I have had so far in the area.  I am still learning the ropes, but this is authentic stuff.  An authentic decor, authentic staff, and authentic sushi.  It was very very good and the rolls are creative."
"1","First time at this restaurant because of all the good reviews. Unfortunately, I won't be returning. The service was superb, no doubt. But the fried chicken was tasteless, sushi was ordinary at best. After more than $50 later, both my hubby and I ended up spending the night in the bathroom."
"4","This is a really comfortable place to have a traditional Japanese meal. The servers were dressed in full authentic kimono (most places don't take the time nor expense to also wear the obis), the bamboo and other decorations created a nice Asian environment. \n\nThere were so many polar reviews...seemed folks were either really happy or not. So I didn't really know what to expect. The sushi rolls were priced modestly, but they are for the smaller rolls versus the \""regular\"" sized roll. The flavor was good and it hit the spot.\n\nI am so glad we went and I will be going back when I return to Pittsburgh! It is so nice to have a decent Japanese restaurant in Squirrel Hill!"
"4","The sushi was delicious. The other food didn't compare. If I go back here I would just stick with the sushi. The waitress and other employees were very attentive. Nice atmosphere."
"5","OMG, I wasn't expecting such an amazing dining experience!  The service and waitress was superb!\nThe Sushi was the freshest I have had in Pittsburgh & the General Tso's (which I order from almost every Chinese restaurant) was the best I have ever had.  Even had the option to get brown rice for no additional cost, this Dumpling House was the best!!!"
"3","I don't get the hype of Pamela's.  The crowded atmosphere is nice, but the food is pretty mediocre, and the service kinda sucks.  I'll go back, but there are better breakfast places to be found in the 'burgh.\n\n(And it's another Pittsburgh business that doesn't take credit cards.  What's with this?  Is it 1990 here?  Most of the places I went to regularly in La Paz, Bolivia, take credit cards.)"
"1","Really people? 4-5 stars for this? Having lived in NYC for the last 8 years, I can tell you that while the ingredients for pizza were present, the food that I put in my mouth last night was not, in fact, pizza. \n\nFirst, the crust was so mushy that when I lifted my slice it actually fell apart! Forget not holding firm for me to bite it, the main part of the slice actually separated from the crust.  Then there was the bland cheese and watered down sauce. If I didn't know better, I would have called this a congealed and tasteless soup.\n\nBleh!"
"2","Bangkok Balcony is a nice spot, but it isn't the best Thai in town.  The tables are a little cramped, but if you're by the window you can enjoy the view of Forbes Ave.\n\nThe price is decent, but I don't think I've been able to get in and out in a decent amount of time.  Between waiting for a table and the slow orders expect to be there a while."
"3","I've dined at Bangkok Balcony a few times. A couple of times, I've ordered one of the stir-fry dishes. The dishes are good but cost a nickel under $14 which is a bit expensive for a stir-fry dish. On my most memorable visit, I ordered a daily special which was served as a whole fish over rice with a Thai chili sauce. The presentation of the dish was rather surprising as they served an entire fish (head and all) as opposed to a fillet which caught me off guard.\n\nOne of the convenient aspects of the restaurant is that you can rate how spicy you would like the dish on a scale of 1 to 10.\n\nThere is also window seating available where you can overlook Forbes Ave while having dinner.\n\nAll in all, Bangkok Balcony is a nice and intimate restaurant but a bit expensive for the type of food they are serving."
"3","Pretty good food. Interesting location."
"5","Murray Ave is great, the staff is always friendly and willing to help, the food is good and you can't go wrong with their beer selections. \n\nThey have a good selection of food so anyone can find something they want and enjoy it. This is a true neighborhood place, if you go a couple of times you are going to find the same people dining there again and again, always a good sign."
"2","I've been here three times over two summers (2013 and 2014), and only had received good food once. \n\nThe first time around (July 2013) I had the Grilled Chicken Panini, which was incredibly soggy from the pesto and cheese. \n\nOne week ago I had a Reuben, and while it was pretty solid, it also wasn't anything particularly special.\n\nYesterday I ordered the \""Famous\"" Salmon Burger, and it came in around 3-5 minutes. Huge red flag; it was very obviously frozen. Extremely bland, not fresh (smelled far too fishy for fresh salmon), just meh. The roasted red pepper mayo wasn't that great, either.\n\nThe fries are alright, though they're extremely greasy.\n\nI could see this place succeeding if the food was cheaper, but the prices here are absolutely outrageous for the quality of food."
"2","I love plain cheese pizza. I love a crunchy yet soft crust, good melty cheese, and a not-too-sweet sauce. Napoli had all three, but where they fell short, which surprised me, was the taste of the crust, it was way too salty. I don't know if it was because it went bad or they didn't measure the salt correctly but I was very disappointed. I loved everything else about the pizza so I hope this was a one-time thing. I will give them another chance but I will buy a single slice next time instead of a whole pie."
"2","I've been to Mineo's a few times, and each time I experienced the same problems that others have mentioned here.  1) There is TOO MUCH cheese, so much that all the cheese comes off the pizza when I bite into it.  This should not happen.  2) The pizza is way too hot, and since I refuse to sit there for an hour waiting for it to cool off, I always end up burning my mouth and fingers.  Not pleasant.  And the cheese issue is worse when it gets cold, so this is quite a dilemma.  3) The staff isn't very friendly, although I've noticed this isn't exclusive to Mineo's.  A lot of the restaurants in Squirrel Hill seem to have this problem.\n\nThat said, their sauce is good and the crust is decent.  Last time I was there, I ended up taking off most of the cheese and just eating the crust with sauce on it.\n\nI realize this review reads like I hate Mineo's, which is not the case.  It's passable pizza, and good if you are very hungry and don't feel like weighing the pros and cons of each pizza place in Squirrel Hill.  I still haven't been to all of them, so I'm not an expert, but I do know that Mineo's is far from the best."
"4","I recently did a pizza crawl through squirrel hill with a friend, where we hit every single one of squirrel hill's 7 pizzerias, and got a slice of pepperoni pizza at each one in a row!  Our favorite of all of them?  Mineos!  It's like loading a shotgun full of delicious cheeses and pulling the trigger.  Their pizza is all around good, but it's primarily a righteous cheese delivery system, and a cheese lovers delight!"
"2","Had this pizza for an office party. Since the person who bought it did carry-out, I guess one can take this review with a grain of salt, seeing as I have no idea how long the pizza took to make, how long it sat out, etc. \n\nThe options were Hawaiian, cheese, and pepperoni, which was really more like a cheese pizza with the occasional pepperoni in the proverbial haystack. The crust was just so thick, and it seemed like the whole thing was just cheese and bread. This made it taste relatively good within the first five minutes of eating, but eventually turned into a force feeding-I had read such fantastic reviews about the pizza, so I wanted to like it.  The saving grace was probably the sauce-I'm a fan of the sweet stuff, so it was exactly how I liked it."
"2","Pizza is nothing special. Canned mushrooms, spinach, and shrimp. Sauce and cheese ordinary. We will not go back"
"5","The best pizza in Pittsburgh... Maybe the world!!!!!!\n\nThe pizza is always amazing, and they are expanding their squirrel hill store to 3 storefronts! \n\nSince I live in squirrel hill, the \""no delivery\"" issue doesn't really bother me. I'm sure if I move that will be a different story..."
"1","Growing up, we lived maybe 5-10min from this place, and every Friday my parents would order Mineos, take it home and we'd have our little pizza day.\n\nPizza Day, opposite as the Aquabats would lead you to believe, became the worst day of the week.\n\nAs a child, I guess I couldn't stand this thick thick cheese and greesey floppy crust. I thought my parents were dinosaurs for using forks and knives to eat this thing. I'd wind up eating one slice and being \""full\"" just because I didn't want to eat any more of this stuff.\n\nNow, I've heard everything under the sun defending Mineos honor whenever I speak these critiques. Most notably \""Oh, well you need to eat it THERE\"". Well, unless Mineos pizza changes quality in the first FIVE MINUTES it's served, then it's official:\n\nMineos Pizza tastes like a foot.\n\n\nNever bought it in my adult life. Very happy I didnt after hearing people say how expensive it is, here."
"4","Flavorful sauce, extra cheesy, crispy on the bottom thin crust. What's not to love about Mineo's pizza?\n\nThe staff isn't the most attentive, but they're friendly enough and take care of you.\n\nAlso the pizzas are huge. We got a large and weren't expecting it to be quite as large as it was. This is another plus.\n\nAlso, got the meatball appetizer. Cheesy and meaty and delicious. Tasted like it came from an Italian grandmother.\n\nBe warned, they're cash only.\n\nDespite what Yelp says, they do have waiter service in the bar area."
"3","Better pizza than any chain.  Better pizza that you would get anyplace other than NYC or Jersey.  BUT, why go here when just up the street is Napoli?  Mineo's has the rep, Napoli has the better pie."
"1","This place used to be decent (pre-2007), but its quality has really gone down a lot recently.  Mostly, they seem to have been cutting too many corners.  They used to serve slices of a rustic olive loaf (probably from Allegro Bakery nearby), but in my last couple visits, the olive loaf was replaced with generic white bread. They used to have a reasonable salad, now it's just iceberg lettuce and a sad slice of tomato. The cut of meat for their steak is now chewy and has fatty inedible bits."
"5","We recently worked with Linda Corcoran with the Squirrel Hill branch of Coldwell Banker.  Linda was wonderful to work with - she was very responsive; understood the market; helped us price our house for quick sale; and found a buyer in a week and a half.  She was also very helpful and reassuring during the inspections by the buyer and she even was kind enough to come over and unlock the door for me when I was accidently locked out - and she got there in 10 minutes!  I think Linda is a great realtor and you will get a knowledgeable, reasonable, understanding, and pleasant human being to work with if you hire her."
"3","Squirrel Hill Cafe AKA \""the Cage\"" can be a good time. This is primarily a student, hippy, hipster, old regulars, and local randoms who live near here spot. They sell decent priced pitchers and broadcast the games. It does get incredibly packed at times. \n\nA solid neighborhood bar where you can sit at the jukebox and pick the tunes you feel like head bopping to. I always end up putting something on like MGMT or Florence and the Machine, I get weird looks when a soulful jazzy soprano starts belting into the room. I'm usually in my own world at that point but you have to love those \""you can find any song you can think of music machines\""  I sure do!\n\nI like pulling up to the bar next to a young college bloke and ordering two fingers of bourbon neat, that's always an eye opener from the Punky Brewster girl with the mouse voice sitting next to you. The bartenders are attentive and so are the servers when you are sitting at the tables. \n\nThere is an upstairs room but the ceiling is crazy low, must just be made for the Shawties! I really like that the booths have such high backs so if you are having an intense conversation you can hide in there!\n\nOne last thing, this is a smoking bar so if that bothers you don't visit, your clothes will be reeking by the end of the night! Cheers!"
"4","Great place for drinks or to socialize.  Lots of seating around the bar plus tables and booths.  Always a busy joint and they have tons of tvs playing sports to make things better the bar food is cheap and tasty.  If i could id give this place 4.5 stars"
"1","I just called over to this practice to try to get a new patient appointment.  Be warned that if you are looking for an appointment that is working-person friendly (saturdays, first thing in the morning or in the late afternoons) you are looking at a long wait.  I was willing to wait 4-6 weeks to get this type of appointment, but they did not have anything that worked with a working person's schedule for seemingly the rest of the year.  The receptionist sounded relieved when I said I was going to call around to other practices to try to get something for this year.  \n\nI would have appreciated a little more flexibility and ended up calling another dentist in Squirrel Hill who was able to get me into a working friendly appointment for this month."
"2","Way too crowded, and not intimate at all with tables practically stacked one right over the other. If you don't have a laptop, then you will feel really awkward. The only nice thing is when it's sunny outside and you can sit on the patio with the sunflower garden they have. The coffee is mediocre. For better drinks, go down 2 blocks to Te Cafe or Crazy Mocha."
"5","Great service. The first reliable and honest mechanic I have encountered to date. Remember a mechanic u can trust is worth his weight in gold. Calfo's is one"
"5","Great and honest service. The guys were kind and straightforward, letting me know all that i needed in order to make decisions about my car.  Reasonably priced and quick service (considering my car was towed during a winter morning).  Thankful they were so close!!"
"3","I found this place after doing some Google searches for watch repair in Pittsburgh. I had a really nice watch gifted to me a few years back, but I didn't find myself wearing it very much, as it was a little too big. Since it's 2012 and we all need to step our game up, I decided to have some links taken out of the watchband and replace the battery in the watch.\n\nI choose this place because, it was the most convenient location for watch repair that I could find. I took my watch in about an hour before the end of the day on Friday. I thought that the job could have been accomplished easily and quickly, but the owner told me I would have to come back the next day...\n\nA word of caution, my watch was wound and working and several links had been removed as promised. However, as I tried the watch on I noticed that one of the pins was not in place properly. It just seemed a little off center. If an untrained eye could note this, a master watchmaker certainly should have been able to do the same. Had I not noticed this, my very expensive watch would have most probably met with a most untimely demise as it plummeted towards the nearest sidewalk. The owner was quick to fix this error, but did not seem very apologetic.\n\nThe price, $20, was fair and the work acceptable in the end."
"2","Great subs, but the place is filthy. Horrible service. Check out another location instead of this one. I've never seen food service staff move so quickly as when you walk in here at 20 mins. till closing time. They want you to inhale your food and get out. The have horrible Sunday hours too (close at 6 pm)"
"4","One of my favorite places for Subs in Pittsburgh. Very cheap (less than $10) and the food is excellent. Can get crowded and loud, but that also means something right? It's probably because I stick with my standard, but I feel like something is missing...\nFor a quick bite or lunch, you certainly can get a satisfying meal here!"
"5","Irene is, quite simply, the world's most talented and responsible alterations seamstress."
"4","Irene saved my life (or at least, my participation as a bridesmaid in one of my closest friends' wedding).\n\nI had another tailor take my measurements and called them into the company that produced the bridesmaid dresses.  When they sent me the dress, in a size that normally fits me with no trouble - NOT TO MENTION they had recommended it based on my measurements - I found that I was unable to zip it up all the way.  Not good, not good at all.\n\nBridesmaid dresses are not made with a ton of extra material, which is why they often tell you to order a larger size and get the dress taken in, rather than risk getting a dress that's too small - there's not much fabric available to let out.  And this dress was silk with a chiffon overlay; quite expensive and not exactly basic.\n\nI took the dress to a tailor who said he could not help me.  As I began to panic, he must have seen the desperation on my face and quickly recommended that I take the dress to Irene.\n\nI left the dress with Irene, and I don't know what kind of miracle she worked, but she found just enough fabric in the seams to get the dress to zip all the way.  She charged $50 (cash only), which I thought was more than fair.\n\nI've also had her shorten a dress for me, and it turned out very well."
"1","this gym is terrible.\n\ndon't let the new equipment fool you, there are only a handful of people who come here who have any clue what they are doing. The staff knows very little, and is way to present, as in milling around doing nothing. However they are in no way the biggest problem, the problem is the patrons, I've never ever had to deal with a ruder group of people in my life, and i lived in NYC for christ sake, I've seen this rudeness manifest into confrontation, injury, and all in all unsafe practices. I've been a member for 2 years and cannot wait until a better option opens! don't join here unless you enjoy being frustrated on a daily basis"
"2","The food is so so but, the desserts are outstanding especially the turtle cheesecake. I would rather eat at The Cheesecake Factory . Personally I don't see what the be deal about this place is."
"3","Like at many places with big menus, I think the trick to Gullifty's is figuring out which items on the menu are the best.\n\nI split an appetizer of soft pretzels with cheese sauce off the Oktoberfest menu, and then ordered The Bomb for dessert.  The pretzel was fine, though probably not homemade, and the cheese sauce had a little too much alcohol in it.  The Bomb was a slice of chocolate cake with a single thick layer of chocolate mousse in the middle.  The cake seemed a touch dry.  I tasted my friends' 5th Dimension cake, another chocolate dessert, and it definitely topped The Bomb.  They were also very happy with the Oktoberfest appetizer they ordered, the sauerkraut balls, but I didn't try that.\n\nSo go for the 5th Dimension, because The Bomb is not, well, da bomb.  (Sorry, I had to do that).  \n\nThe service was fine for our large group.  The waitress dealt with our disorganization good-humoredly.  The timing of the dishes could have been better coordinated--our appetizers came at the same time as dessert, which posed an issue for people who had a la mode dishes, and one friend didn't get her salad until a while after everyone else got their apps and dessert.  To be fair, though, we didn't specify that we wanted our desserts after the rest of our order.  \n\nI'd say that this is a good place to go with a large group of dessert-minded people who like sharing, because you'll more likely than not to find a favorite.  There's also plenty of space for big groups."
"3","a decent spot for lunch given that it is pittsburgh.  it's maybe a little step up from your fast food chinese place in nyc, the quality is a little better and the restaurant itself is obviously cleaner.\n\ni started w/the egg flower soup, it was a little on the salty side, but at least seemed like it was all natural eggs and didn't have the weird fake dark yellow color to it that a lot of places have.  tea was on the house which is nice.  i had the eggplant in brown sauce w/white rice.  overall it was decent, eggplant tasted fresh, but this was also a little on the salty side as well.  \n\ni would have given it 2.5 stars if possible, but rounded up since the older waitresses are very nice and reminded me of my mom.  in the end a decent place for a quick cheap lunch (it's slim pickins for good restaurants in pittsburgh)."
"5","Classy classic, in a row of chains.  In Pittsburgh for a conference with many meals at Sheraton Station Square Hotel.  At end of conference, just wanted to relax in a nice setting. Was so disappointed on first night when I grabbed a meal at the Melting Pot. Tiny portions there and the chain mentality of the servers saying their rehearsed lines. Used Yelp to find Gandy Dancer for last eve and very satisfied.  Sat at bar with nice service from two bartenders. Had a recommended \""kettle\"" meal, jumbalaya with first course house salad, a really nice salad.  Both portions large and beautifully presented."
"4","I had dinner here with a large business group and it was quite good."
"2","I was sooooo disappointed!!  I love this building and the ambiance - it's a Pittsburgh landmark to be sure, but the buffet was mediocre at best.\n\nI don't even know where to start.  \n\nOur waitress was friendly and prompt to come to the table but didn't provide any explanation as to how things were laid out and where things could be found.  This isn't something I normally need for a buffet but things aren't necessarily clear as to where they are - for instance the pancakes are at the omelet bar and the waffles are at the 'banana foster' table.  Anyway.....\n\nI couldn't find the pancakes and I had read in another review that they did indeed have pancakes.  So after asking a passing server I was directed to the omelet bar and was really surprised when the omelet chef handed me four lukewarm pancakes for me to put on my plate.  They weren't made to order as I understood they would be.  On top of that they ended up being chewey and didn't have much flavor. \n\nThe main buffet was another disappointing experience - the chicken was dry, the roast beef was fatty and overall the main food line was average.\n\nUnfortunately, if you're going to have a banana foster area, which can be a really nice touch, it's important to have  a server who knows what they're doing.  As it turned out, there was a young kid who couldn't tell you banana's foster from a banana split.  There were a couple of people in front of me that asked what a 'banana foster' was and his response was that it was anything you wanted it to be.  That answer confused the folks asking, so they passed. As did I.\n\nMaybe it was just a bad day for them as I know other folks have good things to say.  If you want a beautiful place to take out-of-town visitors, this is certainly it.  But if you want to have a really nice buffet experience, sadly this wouldn't be my first choice."
"5","Great food,great atmosphere and view. Very good service."
"4","This past Sunday, a dear friend held a very adult 30th birthday at the Grand Concourse Sunday Brunch buffet. I have not been in this restaurant in...years. It has been forever. The lobby is lovely, and valet is reasonably priced if you don't want to walk to a parking lot. While the Sunday brunch crowd is not a particularly dressy bunch, I recommend wearing something nice. The Snookie look alike in hot pink sweat pants that said \""PINK\"" across the bottom stuck out like a sore thumb...but that may have been in part, because she was cursing like a sailor while waiting for valet...c'mon folks. It's Sunday. \n\nBut I digress. \n\nWe made our way to the table and the whole room is just breathtaking. The staircase leading to the room was often frequented by people having photographs taken. There were several different buffets including your standard brunch items (which were all delicious) as well as some seafood options-shrimp and mussels-salad, some pasta, fresh carved meat, an omelet bar, an ice cream sundae bar, and fresh waffles with yummy bananas foster. Another delicious treat? The fresh doughnuts from the doughnut machine. They roll right off a little conveyor belt and you dip them in powdered or cinnamon sugar...I personally opted to put some of the goo from my bananas foster on my doughnut...SO heavenly. \n\nThe only gripe I have? It's a bit crowded. The layout does not lend itself to easy transportation. Because it is an old train station, there are charming obstacles that add to the charm, but take away from the ease and flow. Some of this frustration comes from parents who do not know how to control their annoying children who want to tap the lobster tank (you are in the middle of the road and causing traffic which is causing me anxiety), but it was only mildly annoying. This is unavoidable given the structure, but totally worth it because of the feel of the building and the quality of the food. \n\nOur service was fabulous-water was always filled, plates were cleared promptly so you could go up for seconds...thirds...there were a few who went for fourths at our table. Needless to say, this fills you up for the whole day. I went home and had a traditional \""Sunday afternoon-after-lunch-after-chuch-nap.\"" It was glorious, and I credit that to my delicious brunch."
"5","This place has all the essential elements for a great Sunday Brunch.  1)  The restaurant itself is a very cool venue.  It is a converted / restored train station, which is absolutely beautiful.  The vintage photos of locomotives are wonderful to see.  Nice views out onto the river as well.  2)  The staff is very friendly and accomodating.  Good service.  3)  The brunch buffet has just about everything you could possibly want, and lots of it.  The food tasted great.  4)  This place has their own donut maker!!  How cool is that?  Freshly made delicious donuts, this place deserves 6 stars.  Come here for brunch, smile all afternoon..."
"1","After having a lovely meal two years ago at the grand concourse, we were very excited to return to this location. Unfortunately our expectation had nothing to do with the reality of a very poor meal.\n\nThe service was slow to the point of neglect. Drinks were never refilled after the initial serving. With a party of six, three of the meals we're delivered cold after a 25 minute wait. Having to send them back it took another 25 minutes to get the replacement meals which were missing the sauces, etc..  It took a manager to get the sauces for the meals. At this point half of our party had eaten, and the other half was ready to leave.\n\nWe had to box our own meals, and forget about being asked if we would like a cup of coffee to cap the meal... That was not in the stars. \n\nNeedless to say, we will not be back."
"1","This place had the nerve to email me through yelp requesting to see if the issue can be resolved  and then. .  NO ONE followed up  to reach out to me after I left a message for the requesting  party.  BUT I expect nothing more.  POOR CUSTOMER  SERVICE"
"2","Oh Station Square. I am sorry. I've stayed here before and not had issues.\n\nAnd the view is great.\n\nWe booked a room for 2 nights to see the Steelers/Jaguars playoff game. We paid for concierge level. \n\nFirst of all, they put us in a handicap room right next to the elevator. The elevator thing would normally not be an issue if there wasn't 300 high school students staying there. \n\nThe bathroom was all shower with a drain in the floor. I was unamused and asked to be switched.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, there was some conference going on ... I think it was for speech? Not sure. Either way, I can tell you that their chaperones were not paying one lick of attention to them. They were running all over the place, door open (creak), door shut (SLAM), yelling outside the elevator.....and the last night, we had a flight home at 6 am the next morning.\n\nI mean, the night of the game, the drunk fans were not even this obnoxious.\n\nCalled security multiple times, they did nothing. It continued. \n\nNext Steelers game we'll be staying on the other side of the river."
"2","We paid $250.00 for our room and there was no hair dryer, not enough towels, mold on the ceiling in the shower,  on the shower curtain liner, and dirt or who knows what on the liner.  \n\nGood location, but the hotel itself leaves much to be desired. For the price, it was a big disappointment!"
"1","I've seen holiday inns better than this.  It's filthy. Stained carpets, stuff sitting out in the hallways. Market doors, peeling paint, you can smell dust and mold.  Waited in SPG line for over 20 minutes to check in. Ridiculous. Got to room and change immediately. Wifi was horrible as well. There is not one good thing about this hotel. I'm here for business and its been a long time since I've seen something this bad."
"3","Very friendly staff. Sucks you have to pay for wifi. Room decor is outdated. The water pressure in the showers was really bad."
"2","The staff is friendly, it's all downhill from there.\n\nRoom 1122 don't book this room if you need to sleep, between the train, the ice machine and the AC/heat wall unit no sleep.\n\nPeeling wallpaper in the common areas, outdated.decor.\n\nFood was cold at lunch.\n\nNo outlets available to charge anything."
"3","Went there for $1 Drink Thursdays and it was okay.  Nothing to write home about but the drinks were cheap so that was cool but other than that, nothing else was special:  Venue, Crowd, Decor.....\n\nCheap Drinks on Thursday.  But would I want to come here any other day....  Hmmmmm...."
"2","Stopped here this morning for some coffee.  The bagels still aren't the greatest--they're okay but not the greatest.  But the coffee is pretty good.  Susan regain human female form after 2nd cup of coffee!"
"2","Convenience is the only plus.  Quality and consistency are lacking."
"1","I gave them 20% tips of my order, but they even forgot my order. I will never go back to have any meal in this restaurant. BTW, my friend told me that although this is a Chinese restaurant, this restaurant \""only\"" open for American people. Because if you are Chinese people, they will not treat you as well as American people. How pathetic this restaurant is !!!"
"4","Needed a late night snack after driving all day and this place was across from our hotel.  Pizza was great, crust was cooked just the way I like it, crispy on the edges and lots of cheese and toppings.   Staff was friendly."
"2","I had the special at the servers suggestion.  It was a chicken with stuffing, mashed potatoes, and fresh vegetables.  The veggies were not fresh, the patatoes were undercooked and the chicken dry."
"3","I dig Hanlon's. I love that pretty much all of their dishes come with a side and the price is right. Everything on their menu sounds delish and it takes a little while for me to decide. For any hoagie, you can make it a wrap at no extra charge. I usually order the buffalo chicken wrap & its fabb !! I've also had the eye opener breakfast which is the works (eggs, meat, potatoes & toast) for $4.99. I've never had a salad from here, but they are huuuuge! & only around $9 which is the standard salad price downtown, but I've witnessed Hanlon's using 3/4 a head of lettuce in one salad, awesome!!"
"3","Hanlon's is a little diner right in the middle of  Liberty ave and very easy to miss. I generally stop in here when I am looking for a cheaper place but pretty decent food. My issue in previous stops was the ventilation was bad and AC didn't keep up with the heat of the grills you can see from your booth. Also, lets face it, most of us would prefer to go back to work not smelling like a French fry. \n\nOk, lets stay positive! The service is always good and again the price is right. I have had several items on the menu and I went with a Sicilian melt this time around. As usual, the food is served hot and ready to roll. The portions aren't enormous but they do the job. You can get out of here cost wise in under $10 if you skip the soft drink. I have had a turkey club, salads, burger, chicken fingers basket....just don't expect anything incredible in here. \n\nI do think its a decent stop and very easy to fit in a lunch hour at work."
"3","Ok I guess...Ate there this morning about 8:45. Sat down, was acknowledged with a nod and be with you in a minute...but was closer to 7 or 8. Ordered \""the handful\"" which has 2 eggs, 2 pancakes, potatoes, and 2 bacon. Wanted to trade bacon for veggies but was told it would be $1 more even though on side items, the bacon cost more than the veggies...go figure.  Make the customer happy and he'll come back tomorrow, don't and he won't.\nIt was decent, can't complain too much, but can't give thumbs up either."
"5","Great pace to relax on lunch break and snatch up some wifi on a couch!"
"3","If you want an ornate and well taken care of hotel you can rest assured that the William penn is what your looking for. It's killer for events, the lobby looks like you steeped onto the set for a history film. My only complaint is that the rooms themselves are a bit outdated. The carpet seems old and there isn't a lot of space to move around in. I'd say it's worth checking out, there's a Starbucks right next store so you can grab a coffee and sit in the hotel lobby for a bit, but  I wouldn't pay the price for a room."
"3","The hotel lobby is beautiful early 20th century architecture.  Even The Starbucks, tucked inside the lobby, is handsome. \nThe room was attractive, but I think housekeeping (& maintainence) need some attention. There was a large chunk of bread beneath the hassock, the hair dryer was cracked and one of the Roman shades would not go down. (I left a note on the shade, but I'll bet that the next guest will up with the sun - ready or not.)  Oh, and if you do plan to sleep in, make sure to put the privacy sign on the door or between 7:30 and 8 AM you'll get a \""housekeeping\"" knock. (Never had a hotel making the rounds that early!)\nBut the most annoying occurance was on our last morning, while the Mrs. showered I ran down to Starbucks to get us some coffee, upon returning my electronic key wouldn't work.  I asked one of the housekeepers to open the door, but according to her list, this was not my room.  She had to call security.  10 minutes later, security arrives but has to see ID. After proving 'I was I - and this was indeed my room, without apology he was off.  Perhaps it's mega-chain malaise, but there definetly seems to be a brush up needed on client etiquette. \nDespite its challenges, the building is beautiful, the location is great and the $20 breakfast buffet was very good.  \n(Oh, but the $10/ day for WiFi is so tacky for this hotels prices.)"
"5","Stayed at the Wm Penn down the street for a wedding and needed a last minute haircut. Friendly, helpful, all around good cut!"
"2","Honestly, I'm not sure what everyone is raving about.  It was a lovely way to see the city but the driver spend the entire time making duck jokes, and yes I get that duck jokes are the gimmick but I thought there would be a little bit more information on the city.  He would point out a building or statue and mention the name but that was about all the info you got before he started quacking again. It also only takes a quick route through downtown then spins up by the stadiums on water.  I thought we would see more.\nOur seats were REALLY uncomfortable.  We were in the back and the space was not long enough for our legs. We shared the duck mobile with a large (Somewhat pushy) elderly group who were not interested in sharing with us or the nice young couple who were there with their toddler.  They cut in line, tried to sit in all the window seats and It was a battle just to get them to move around so we could sit together. \nAll in all I wouldn't recommend it for grow ups. Fun if you have kids (or are pushy spoiled old folks who act like kids!)."
"2","The air conditioning in room 1602 didn't work, and the hotel refused to take responsibility. They simply laughed and said that we should have let them know the night before- we didn't get in until 2am- i would not stay here again. Ridiculous customer service."
"1","This place was a shambles. OK, so it was Labor Day, but if you are going to give most of the staff the night off, then do not take lots of reservations and tell everybody that comes in it is a 10 minute wait.\n\nHaving been told that it would be a 10 - 15 minute wait, 30 minutes later we where still sitting around, twiddling our thumbs. We were then told that some other party of three had taken our spot. When we finally got seated we then sat for another 15 minutes before a waiter came over. He did at least apologise and said he thought another waiter was taking care of us. We stopped him mid welcoming speech and ordered a large pizza, that was supposed to feed four or more. The three of us finished it quickly and were still hungry. The toppings were sparse and totally missing on some pieces.\n\nI would not come back here."
"2","Bucca Di Beppo is an Italian chain restaurant specializing in huge portions of mediocre food, with goofy, but likeable decorations thrown around inside.\n\nThere is a whole group of diners that believes quantity trumps quality and this chain is custom designed for them. Food is served family style; small orders usually feed 2+ average people and large up to 4. Many people feel you are getting a great value here, but personally I see lots of very CHEAP pasta being served and you are paying through the nose for it.\n\nThe pizza's are thin crust and rectangular and did not look very appetizing due to the toppings being slung on it haphazardly and one side was a little burnt, a frozen Frescheta is better than what we were served. The chicken carbonara is nothing like a regular Carbonara, it is served with Alfredo sauce instead the egg thickened cream sauce. \n\nI can go on and on, a lot of the entrees are pasta, red sauce and cheese, pretty common American Italian fare, nothing exciting. Now was the food inedible or bad - NO, but to be honest The Olive Garden which would get three stars if I ever choose to review it. Quite frankly Olive Garden, has better and more authentic (hard to believe but it's true) food.\n\nLike I said earlier I can see this as a popular place with a certain crowd of diners, it serves it purpose and will continue to be successful, to be absolutely honest, I wanted to like it more than I did. It was a fun atmosphere and I like the concept, but I would much rather pay $14 for an entr\u00e9e, finish it all and be wowed, than pay $16 for a mediocre pile of food and have mediocre leftovers for the next 2 days."
"1","So, I went to Buca di Beppo a couple of months ago as I was in P-burgh for a meeting.  I hadn't eaten since the morning and was very hungry and thought I would drop in for an early dinner.  Bad idea.\n\nI came in alone and not with a group and I came in early.  Not really their target demographic; however, they had no idea what to do with me.  So what did they do with me?  The put me in some back room near a kitchen.  Just me, some gangster memorabilia, big band music... and an empty room near the kitchen.  I eventually found a server and told him that I would eat at the bar, you know, where there are other people...\n\nThey let me order off the lunch menu, that was nice, so I ordered a lunch portion spaghetti.  Another bad idea.  The spaghetti sauce was terrible, tasted like catsup, the pasta was \""old\"" and seemed like it had been in the refrigerator for a couple of days and the meatball tasted like they walked over to McDonalds and asked for some hamburger meat.\n\nI realize that Buca really isn't structured to serve the one-man early-dinner customer.  And that is another drawback.  The place is located in a business center area.  They need to know who their potential customers are.\n\nThe Station Square location is kind of odd, it is tucked in by the river between the tunnels.  However, just walk across that cool bridge and find a local place across the river in the down town area.  Avoid Buca unless you are with a big group and want a pasta-heavy meal.  Actually, there are Italian restaurants across the river or further up Carson.  Just avoid Buca.\n\nNot going back to Buca, in any city.\n\nAside, P-burgh is a cool town and I can't wait for my next trip back."
"2","It isn't that I didn't enjoy my food and the service.  It just didn't live up to my experience at other Joe's I've been to.  I have been to Joe's in two other cities and had better, more memorable experiences.  \n\nTo some extent, we felt rushed.  Only a few minutes after taking our drink order, the server came back three times asking if we were ready to order.  I felt pressured to make a choice.  The drinks and appetizers came out very quickly as did our main meal.  Too quickly.  We had barely dug into the appetizers when the entrees were brought out.  Usually this isn't that big an issue, but when you are having one of the hot pots, you basically have to start eating it right away (because who likes cold crab legs or clams?).  We were there on a Saturday night, so perhaps they are set up so they can have a quick turn around and get a lot of people through with minimal wait times, but I personally like to take time to savor my meals.  \n\nIf you like food with a kick, I highly recommend the \""great balls of fire\"" appetizer.  Filled with flavor, but with just the right amount of spice to not kill your tastebuds.\n\nFor an entree, I had the Joe's Classic steam pot.  It was tasty, but didn't seem as flavorful as I had expected.  My dining companion had chicken tenders and he thought they were very tasty.  It is nice that they have options like steak and chicken tenders at a restaurant that focuses on seafood.  Many similiar locations have far fewer options.\n\nOverall, food was decent and service was OK.  There are just a lot more restaurants that I'd prefer to visit again (or for the first time) before I'll come back to Joe's."
"2","Drove into Pittsburgh really late at night. So late the city had pretty much shut up shop. Walked around Station Square for literally an hour passing this place three times before finally having lost all sense of reason and succumbed to the kitsch seafood decor, flying shark with mardi-gras beads in its mouth and party lights. I am allergic to crab but thought hey you only live once right?! and ordered the lobster and king crab steam pot from the extra super buff teenage waiter whose shirt was so tight I could not understand how he could carry around a tray full of food. He was pleasant enough and although the place was practically empty he was never around when I wanted him and always around asking if I needed anything while I was stuffing my face full of sea creatures. The steampot was fine but the whole box of spices they add to it completely ruin the dish and I shudder to think they try to do that to hide how not-so-fresh the seafood is..ugh..Well I didn't have my face in a toilet or have exploding diarrhoea after or die from sea creature poisoning so there's a plus. The prices are really high for what they serve but Pittsburgh is pretty far from the ocean. On the plus side I love trains and you can sit right next to the train line and not even hear them pass every 20mins. Also the view across to the city is amazing across the river framed by the monumental massive amount of bridges and you are literally steps from the funicular to walk off your dinner. So whats the lesser of two evils this place or the Hard Rock Crappe next door?"
"1","Horrible experience as I'm typing this.   We were with a group that was supposed to be seated at 7 pm. Got seated at 7:45pm.   Frustrating when you  go into the restaurant and there are tons of empty tables that you cant are till you seated .  Do they think you don't notice stuff like that?  8:15pm and still no waitress.   This food better be dang good      Which still won't make up for the inattentive waitress.  I swear we were invisible!   Maybe her tip should be too!"
"4","a cozy breakfast spot similar to dennys or kings minus the shit your pants feeling you get from dennys or kings.  ive only eaten breakfast here cant speak on the other foods but if you can make a bomb breakfast lunch and dinner should be similar."
"2","My grandmother brought my family here for my parents 25th Anniversary.  I made the mistake of Yelping this place the morning we were going.  I cringed with the low score and prayed for the best.  With this knowledge, I ordered safe all night, and I had a decent meal.  My family did not, and I got to see first hand many of the complaints highlighted.  The first warning sign should have been that on a Saturday night, this place was empty.\n\nFor the record, we did not have trouble with the cigarette smoke in the non-smoking banquet room.  But I don't think anyone was smoking much so take it with a grain of salt.\n\nThe family all ordered coffee, and I started with a Cosmopolitan.  The waitress was great about the coffee refills and water refills.  The cosmopolitan was a joke.  First of all, it was the smallest drink I have ever seen, and it was so practically all cranberry juice.  At $7, I was over it.\n\nThen, a basket of bread came out.  The bread was pretty good.  There was a good variety and some unique things in the basket.\n\nMichael's one highlight is the number of sides you get with a meal.  Our meals included soup or salad, potato, and a vegetable.  Just like grandma would make.  However, the soup was not the quality of grandma's.  We all had chicken dumpling soup.  3 little dumplings with a debatable about being homemade soup.  Not too impressed.  Another table got the salads, and the salads looked sad.\n\nMeals:\nPrime Rib-  As my mother so deeply said, \""For being a special, you would think they would know how to cut and cook this.\""  It was mostly fat and apparently pretty awful.  I actually think my mother threw it away when we got home.  My grandmother handed the waitress back the plate and asked her to dump out the excess sauce because it was mostly that.\n\nVeal Parm-  I played it safe and mostly won.  Two decent sized pieces of veal covered in cheese.  Safe choice.\n\nCrab Stuffed Shrimp-  For being over $25 you would THINK Michael's used real crab.  Nope.  These things were stuffed with filler and the portion was tiny.  Not amused.\n\nThe sides, however, were pretty good.  The twice baked potatoes were excellent and the fried zucchini was a score.  I would just order the sides next time.\n\nWe passed over on dessert fearing for more disappointment.  The final bill was right around $100.\n\nThe moral of the story?  Michael's recipes are ok, but the food prices are simply not acceptable.  I can say honestly that the, \""Meh.  I've experienced better.\"" rating is completely accurate."
"5","Just watch where you pick up your produce."
"3","Had dinner there Saturday night with my wife. Arrived a little after 6 and got a table right away - NICE. Our waiter was great and really took care of us during our visit.  We started with a nice glass of wine. Our food arrived quickly and was good. I wouldn't say outstanding but good.  I had the Brentwood sandwich.  It was tasty although the chicken breast was a bit thick for a sandwhich. (I personally would have pounded it and tenderized it a little - but that's just me!) The fries were a bit of a disappointment. They weren't really hot and appeared to have been pulled from the oil a little too soon. Still a bit white. Fries should be golden brown - right?\n\nMy wife had the fish tacos. The came out in flour tortillas.  Really?? Who eats fish tacos in flour tortillas? (use fresh corn tortillas man! - doubled up of course!) Anyway.  If they had been hand made thick hot fresh tortillas, well, that would have been a little better.   But these things looked and tasted like they were right out of the bag from the wholesale food supplier. Pity, the filling of the taco was quite tasty according to my wife. She ate the filling of the second one and left the shell.\n\nThe service - excellent. The food, well, maybe it was just bad timing.  I would definitely give them another shot. Check them out for yourself and let us yelpers know what you thought!"
"1","I've been to Houlihan's in other cities, but was sorely disappointed in the Station Square chain.  We waited a solid 20 minutes for someone to take our drink order once we were seated.  Wait staff walked by us several times.  Finally I asked someone to help us.  When we put in our food order (appetizers only) it also seemed to take forever.  I had to get up and ask the hostess to find us some place settings so we could eat, and that took forever as well.  The food was nothing special.  If they are busy, skip this place."
"3","Overpriced and small portions, but oh so delicious. Nice location. Not so friendly staff though."
"4","Do I look electrified?  I should because I was shocked at how much I enjoyed a meal here.\n\nIn town for a couple of days and wandered over to Station Square and decided to drop in here for a meal.  I'd eaten here once before and it was unmemorable but figured it was worth another shot.  \n\nSat at the bar where I received fast and friendly service.  My glass of club soda was never empty, which I appreciated.  I ordered a pasta dish and it came out looking like a Kraft Mac n Cheese reject, but then I tasted it and it was very good.  The sauce was nice and spicy and the chicken was tender and moist.\n\nThey talked me into the brownie sundae for dessert and like a strong wind, it blew me away.\n\nOkay, so this isn't fine dining but if the food is good, the service is great and the price is reasonable, then that means four stars in my book."
"2","I really wanted to like this place, but going to a brewery and they hand you a menu and tell you they only have 3 beers available?! FAIL! Especially when they are out of their seasonal Oktoberfest beer-and its Oktober...you're a brewery, you know the demand for somehting like this. \n\nAnyway, service was mediocre, we moved to a larger table when some family arrived, I had to ask 4 times to include 2 beer stiens into the bill. The bill arives (finally) no stiens were listed. I asked our waitress AGAIN...it took her forever to come back, I figured she was hand blowing them in the back. I contemplating walking over to the bar and helping myself but I refraiend. \n\nAll in all, if I'm ever in town again I most likely wont come here. It was a total let down.\n*sad face*"
"2","I really wanted to love this place. Hell. I used to love this place. For the food, anyway. I'm not a beer drinker, but I'm into eating food. The service here, however, leaves something to be desired.\n\nOn previous visits to Penn Brewery we've enjoyed dining outside and have enjoyed the food. This week, we were excited there was a Craft Beer Week event here and the collaboration beers had the BF all in a tizzy. We made our way there (in rush hour and everything!), parked in the mini garage and made our way inside. Inside, it was a madhouse. The bar was jam packed. The tables were full. The hostess stand was abandoned. We awkwardly stood at the hostess stand since we were hoping to get some food while we were there. No one came, and no one came. When an employee finally came over, it was like he didn't know what a hostess stand was or how to operate said hostess stand. He was confused about what to do, handed us menus and told us we could sit anywhere. We snagged a table from two women who were about to leave and started to look over the menu. After a few minutes and no sign of a waiter, a waiter came over and asked us if we'd been seated here. Yes, we said, we were given menus and told we could sit here. 'Welllll (I'm channeling all three nasal-y Kardashians here), you can't sit here. There's a long wait.' But- b-b-b-b- the man said we could sit here :( 'Yeah, there's a really long wait.' This woman was SO rude. I was immediately peeved. We'd already been ignored, given false information and THEN rudely told to move like we were some sort of aliens trying to jump the 'wait' list. We were not offered to have our name put on the list while we waited at the bar, we were just told to MOVE IT. I looked at this rude waitress, looked at my accomplice, and said, \""CAN WE LEAVE?\"" And we did. I tweeted them about it and they said 'We are very sorry about that! We'll let the staff know so we can prevent that in the future.' But what's done is done. And no free app or anything? Fuh-GET about this place and its shenans. If I need a raucous night of German beer drinking I'll head to Hofbrauhaus. Hmph!"
"1","Took a cab from downtown to catch dinner about 30 mins before their publicized kitchen close time. They closed the kitchen early and said they can't help me. Great. Glad I called ahead of time. Now I'm in the middle of nowhere and starving."
"4","I am a huge fan of the Penn Brewery and if you don't know me I am a bit of a booze hound. I love beer! All types, all colors, all ABV's. So I ran in here today for lunch but I  am not allowed to imbibe during work hours. Woe is me....the world is not fair! My point is if you enjoy a beer, just about any type...this is the place to start. I have been here 10+ times and this was my only non-drinking visit. \n\nI enjoyed the Braumeister Steak Sandwich with fries. The food, service and atmosphere were great. Try to find the time to visit this place. Well worth the stop."
"1","Nope. This is overpriced nonsense. I hate to start out the review with a statement so crass, but truly, its location allows this establishment to charge a great deal of money for a meal that is not really that good. Once you get past the pot of liquid and the skewer, think about what you're eating, and then look at the bill. These things do NOT add up."
"2","I am not a fondue fan so I wasn't expecting much out of a group meal but our service was extremely slow. I am under the impression they get a lot of groups and we had made a reservation way in advance. Wouldn't choose to come here again."
"1","The Melting Pot was a big disappointment. Yes, it was a unique dining experience but not in a good way. Our server was well versed and very nice but the food was not at all worth the price. I ordered the vegetarian plate which included about half of the things it said it would. The dipping sauces that accompanied the food weren't well thought out. My date ordered the duck and pork which had the same dipping sauces as the vegetables. The salad was something you would have gotten at any diner. It just didn't live up to the prices in my opinion. I left with over half of my dish uneaten. My date wanted to order a pizza when we got home. We wont be returning."
"5","Got the \""Big Night Out\"" couples special. Worth every penny. Was nice we could substitute the cheese fondue, salad and dessert for what we wanted. Was highly satisfied with the entree choice. The \""three rivers feast entree came with: teriyaki steak, filet mignon, chicken breast, 4 shrimp, bbq seasoned pork, and pot stickers. We also added a lobster tail.  \n\nStarted with the fiesta cheese fondue which was excellent. Beer base, cheddar cheese and salsa. The waitress allowed us to choose how spicy we wanted the cheese by adding fresh jalape\u00f1os which was nice. We went for hot which was perfect level of spicy. This was served with a white bread, pumpernickel, tortilla chips, baby carrots, cherry tomatoes, broccoli, and Granny Smith Apples (not a good combo personally). \n\nCaesar salad was next. Pretty standard. Small but that was ok because I didn't want to get too full.\n\n\nNext was the entree. The meats were served with mushrooms, redskin potatoes and broccoli. We cooked it Coq Au Vin style \n(burgundy wine infused with fresh herbs, spices and mushrooms.) The pork was my favorite and hers was the seafood. It was also served with 6 small dipping sauces (+1 for lobster) which paired greatly with all the meats and vegetables. \n\n\nLastly, grand finale! White chocolate Creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e. Went all out and got the additional dippers. Fresh strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, bananas, chocolate chip cookie, brownie, pound cake, gram cracker coated marshmallows, Oreo coated marshmallows, slice of cheesecake, cream puffs, Rice Krispie treats, and some rolled cookie. \n\nStaff was great. They clear your table fast so no dirty plates sit around. If you ever need more specific dippers they'll bring them for you. Very accommodating. Didn't like the first beer I got so the waitress didn't charge me for it and got me a different one even though I didn't care. Overall if you're willing to spend some cash but for great quality and quantity, this is the place to go."
"3","You can always count on this place for a good lunch. Nothing too crazy, just your regular Americanized Chinese food. It's a much better option than the PPG food court Chinese food, which is known to make people sick, eek! \nGreat lunch prices.  Gets a little busy, so I'd suggest making your way over before noon."
"4","My husband and I decided to have dinner at Station Square and afterwards, just kind of stroll around.  We decided on going to Sesame Inn, which is one of Pittsburgh's most popular Chinese restaurants--and with good reason.  The food here is typical Chinese-American fare, but it is very tasty and a good value.\n\nIf you read my reviews of other Chinese restaurants, you'll know that I love just the basics.  Oh, sure, I like to try something new once in awhile, but on the night we went, I wanted something familiar and yummy.  I opted for the shrimp with vegetables.  The shrimp was good and tender, the vegetables nice and crisp, and the white sauce not overpowering--just the way I like it.  Rick opted for Sea Scallops with Ma La Sauce, which kind of surprised me.  He rarely has seafood out.  I tasted the scallops, but they were a little too spicy for me.\n\nWhile we love the eggrolls here, they are the melt-in-your-mouth type, we opted for something a little different this time.  We had the fried dumplings for an appetizer.  They were not at all greasy or heavy.  Rick has also eaten the boiled dumplings, saying they are delicious.\n\nAs I  said, this place is the perfect blend of good food, good value, and a great location."
"3","Even though I'd been going to Pittsburgh for 3 years, I'd never been to Station Square before. On a friend's suggestion, we took the T from downtown Pittsburgh to Station Square. Sesame Inn is located inside a decidedly odd mall with twisty passages. The decor certainly is nice. We ordered Amazing Pork. I thought it was good but it isn't as spicy as it looks so I can't say that it is \""amazing\"". Then again, I'm spoiled when it comes to East Asian cuisine because I'm a regular at Flushing Chinatown. No issues with the service. Prices are a bit higher than the average Chinese restaurant but that is to be expected because this place aims to be a cut above the average."
"2","It's not that it was bad, just that it was basic \""Americanized\"" Chinese food.  \n\nWe were there for lunch and specifically went because it appeared to locally get good reviews on Yelp.  Ambiance is dreary and bland.  Service was relatively quick.  Staff seemed friendly enough.  Menu was basic and did not have uniquely authentic Chinese dishes.  Comparable to a Panda Express in our opinion.  Maybe there is just not a market for Chinese food here in Pittsburgh. \n\nAgain, it was not that it was bad, but not sure we will go back."
"3","I'm a big fan of Michael Chabon's Wonder Boys, and an even bigger fan of the movie adaptation of the same name. The bar scene was filmed here, and I mentioned it in passing a few times. It turns out Toronto is pretty close to Pittsburgh and we didn't have Friday plans and did have a rental car so away we went... to get drunk in this dive and sit in the red booth at the back. Mission accomplished. \n\nI checked out a couple of stellar establishments in the rust belt, but I want to review this one first. It was a very fun time, but the bar itself is kind of strange and riddled with questionable characters. I'm fairly certain I had a five minute conversation with someone who had recently been smoking crack... and I'm from Ford Nation so I should know. \n\nPEPPER PROPS to a friendly bar tender who poured cheap drinks happily and kept the shady folks in check. \n\nPEPPER'S PISSED: Come on, Pittsburgh. Figure out your taxi situation."
"2","Poker machine gambling hole. These bums dont pay state local or federal wage taxes."
"1","Mandy's food is OK. The pizza is mediocre, often burnt,  but the sandwiches are very good. We moved to Observatory Hill about 18 months ago and we like to support local businesses. However, after 6 months of consistently terrible service we sadly had to find a new pizza place. Every single time I have called in an order I would be put on hold for several minutes right away. That is a long time to be on hold and I understand places get busy, but every time? To top it off the employees would often argue with me about my order \""we would like a large pizza.\"" Employee: \""you mean a 16 inch?\"" Me: \""I don't know, the menu I am using doesn't have the inches listed.\"" Employee: \""Well it's 16 inches.\"" Another time I was asked what size fries I wanted. I told them I didn't order fries. They had so much trouble understanding that I had not ordered fries that it turned into a yelling match. Never before in my life have I felt so harassed trying to place an order.\n\nOne time the delivery driver called my cell phone and hung up when I answered. I went outside and asked him why he just hung up. Driver : \""I can't spare the minutes.\"" This is the same driver who brings his dog in the car and when he isn't making deliveries the dog sits in his car all day in front of the pizza shop. What someone else said about the employees looking like parolees is definitely spot on. Some drivers will just call your cell and not even GET OUT OF THEIR CAR to deliver your order, instead waiting for you to come to the drivers window.\n\nOn one occasion I went to pick up an order at the store and the counter near the door looked like the pick up area but it was actually at the other end of the counter. Therefore, I was simply ignored until I figured out I was standing at the wrong end. Then the employee tried to make me feel stupid by telling me \""Yeah, I had no idea why you were standing there. No one has ever stood there before.\""\n\nSeriously?  It's just unbelievable how rude these people are. Check it out for yourself."
"2","Friendly atmosphere and very good service. But the Reuben sandwich didn't have very much meat, a disappointment since the other ingredients were plentiful."
"2","Worst zoo I have been to. Not a good zoo if you have a big stroller. There were hills upon hills and it was way more exhausting than fun. There were doors in the kids exhibit that i could barely get my stroller through. \n\nThe playground was awful. Like some tunnels and nets. \n\nSecurity was super nice and helpful though. I had left my headlights on and they notified me :)"
"3","3.5 stars. It was my first time taking a bus out of Pittsburgh and I was heading to NY overnight on an express bus. Bought my ticket online at $34 (I saved maybe $20 by buying online) and printed it at home. The interior of the station is well lit, appeared to be clean (though I did not use the bathrooms) and there were two flat screen tvs playing a tv show on TBS while we waited. Customer service was fine when I asked the gate number, and there was security on the premises. Instead of lining up by boarding number, it was a first come first serve line. The buses are relatively nice with outlets so you can charge your phone/tablet/laptop and so on. Wi-fi was in and out. Variety of riders though seems similar to riding a plane - you just don't know who you'll end up next too! The bus left at 10:30pm and arrived in NY on time at 5:50am at the first stop (made one pit stop)."
"2","After reading reviews both here and on other sites, we decided to try it.  It was 6:00 p.m. on a Wednesday.  The whole dining experience began with them out of the Vietnamese appetizer I wanted to try.  So I ordered 2  old stand-bys - wanton soup & an egg roll.  My husband ordered steamed dumplings.  Soup was just barely lukewarm & way over salted.  Egg roll was greasy, cold & tasteless.  Only the hot mustard saved it.  Dumplings were very good.  Ordered chicken with cashew nuts.  Not a single cashew. Veggies might have been waved over the wok - huge pieces of green pepper, celery (stalk cut into 1/3's), big chunks of carrots all so crunchy, I almost asked for a dip to go with them!  Food very cold.  When I complained there was not 1 nut on plate, he said they forgot to put them on top.  He came back with a dish of warm cashews and put them on my entree.  No sense in complaining about temp of food - I don't take any chances of irritating the chef/cook.  While my husband liked what he ordered (can't remember - poh something with chicken), it also was cold.  Only item that was hot was the complimentary tea.  Best thing about this restaurant - our waiter was pleasant & polite - we tipped him the usual 20% we tip - it wasnt his fault. We absolutely love the food at Yummy's in the Rostraver/Belle Vernon area.  We like to order take-out.  We live 20 minutes from there and the food is piping hot when we get it home!  We won't stray from there again.  Sorry, Me Lyng - food was cold, tasteless & mine was lacking one of the titled ingredients.  Never again."
"1","just went to shitsburgh for the kings pens game....we called about 8 cabs over 4 days....the SHORTEST wait was 45 minutes. A couple times, they never even showed up or called. While a couple of the cabbies we got were ok, others were either f'n nuts or no help at all. How can a town have a cab co. that doesn't do thier job. We actually had to get a ride home from one of the workers from Excuses on the south side to our hotel. Are you fucking kidding me???? WHY HAVE CABS??? I would give them a minus 890573295672579067 if I could...."
"1","First of all, it's an absolute crime that in a city this size, there are not cabs available on the street.  In one of the main bar districts, at 2-3 am when places are closing up, there are no taxis patrolling around?  Seriously??  Do you actually WANT to make money or are you just in business as a hobby?\n\nSecond, how about when we call for a cab, you actually fucking send one, assholes?\n\nWe waited thirty minutes and called again, received assurances that the cab was on its way, waited another fifteen minutes, and then gave up.  Thanks to Yellow Cab, we had to hoof it 1.5 miles back to our hotel, which normally would not be the end of the world, but it was 3:30 am, we were all dead tired, and my one poor friend has a bum knee.  \n\nSo fuck you, Yellow Cab.  I'm putting the Green Cab number in my phone and we'll be trying them next time."
"1","Terrible service. I have called ahead on several different occasions to be picked up at a specific time & they have been late EVERY time. The last time I tried to use them the driver called me 30 minutes after the time I requested & then hung up on me when I told her that I already got another cab. Right after she hung up  - I got 3 separate phone calls to confirm that I wanted to cancel my reservation. \n\nUnfortunately, there aren't many options to choose from in the Pittsburgh area (which is probably why they can continue to operate as they do) -  but I try to take Classy Cab whenever possible."
"1","The taxi never showed up. I had this experience twice. They didn't show up after I called at 5 am when no one else would need a taxi. They suck. Don't use them."
"1","We attempted to use this cab co. to take us home from two spots -- Carnegie Natural History Museum and Ross Park Mall. At Carnegie, We waited a1.5 hrs for a taxi to come cuz 1) Dispatch sucked and sent them somewhere else and 2) I swear the cabbies dont want to drive out of the way, so they don't. From the mall, no taxi was even dispatched! Again, they probably don't want to drive out of the way but then why not say so instead of leading us to believe they are at least trying. Feeling stranded in a city sucks. The city needs a better taxi service!!"
"1","I wish I could give you zero stars. Lived in Pittsburgh since '95 and the only time I can score a taxi is when I am staying at some some swanky hotel downtown? Yellow Cab needs to drink the poison and go the way of dodo. Losers. Don't ever call Yellow Belly Cab when you need a ride to work. You will lose your job. Constantly call and get wait time in the hours and the Taxis never show up. I actually drove cabs for Yellow for a week until I needed to get a cab to pay rent and couldn't. I personally witnessed drivers gambling and smoking crack while waiting for hours at the airport to get a fair."
"1","Yellow Cab insists that they have a big enough fleet to handle the demands of the city but in reality they have a big enough fleet to handle what they believe our demands are.  On a typical Saturday night after midnight there is at least an hour wait if you call so I suggest you head to the closest downtown hotel to find a cab. \n\nWhat confuses me is that the taxis at these hotels sit there.  They stay at the hotel not picking up anyone.  I guess their employees hate money?\n\nTo top it all off after a certain hour they will turn off their meters which means they are scamming you.  Isn't that illegal?  \n\nThey know after the buses and T's stop they have the residents under their thumb so they can choose between picking them up or taking a nap (which we have witnessed before)."
"4","Their deli sandwiches are great.  Service is very friendly: the deli workers seem determined to convert you to the Cult of Cured Meat and won't take no for an answer; the lady who mans (womans?) the checkout counter always has a smile and a kind word; and the guy behind the butcher counter is gruff, hilarious, and disturbingly good with a knife.  Prices are high, but hey, any area that has both an Eyetique *and* an Apple Store is going to be outrageously affluent (and so its shops are obviously going to be outrageously overpriced).\n\nThere's almost no parking to be had.  Most of the cars on Walnut seem to belong to people with too much money and too little competence behind the wheel.  So, if you value your life, come here on foot.  Then again, if you valued your life you probably wouldn't be eating their incredibly delicious (and incredibly high-calorie) sandwiches in the first place ...\n\nDuring our first year of marriage, my wife once wanted to make me pot roast for dinner, and so she came here to ask the butcher what cut of meat would be best.  He was so touched by this that he gave her the best he had.  Whenever I think of Shadyside Market & Deli, this is the first memory that comes up -- and it never fails to bring a smile to my face."
"2","This is not a place I would recommend....table for two in virtually an empty restaurant....speaking of that table it was one of those that wobbled, there was another table very close to us and with us pretty much being the only ones in there, we just shifted over....\n\nthe decor is avg to not that nice, nothing special......just a boring not so fun place to be....the sushi was ok, but too expensive for this type of place....for nigiri pieces, your typical rolls and special rolls it was over priced....the lady that served us was very nice though and did a pretty good job, this was a pretty forgetable time here...I guess if youre in station square and want sushi quick, pop in here to get your fix, but it's not a place I'd go to when choosing where to dine for the night...."
"5","To me, this is the best restaurant in Pittsburgh. Not the best Japanese or Asian place, but the hands-down best. \n\nThe sushi is sublime. From your basic tuna rolls to your fancier hand rolls and specialties, I've not had anything I didn't want more of. The second-best sushi I've ever had. \n\nHowever, what makes this place shine is how good everything ELSE tastes! Too often, people thing Japanese = sushi. From the simple miso soup and house salad (which were far above others I've had) to the various platters, each dish tastes like a delicacy. The steak and chicken teriyaki are delicious choices that satisfy the more timid palate, and the various hot dishes that arrive on platters are all also excellent. Even the desserts, though simple, are excellent. I recommend the anjou pear poached in plum wine. \n\nThe downsides of this place are parking ($), price ($$$), and interior. Being in Station Square, you'll likely have to pay to park. The portions are not large for the money, which means you'll spend even more to be full. I expect to spend upwards of $70 for two when I come here. Also, the inside is plain and somewhat dated, which doesn't attract me. \n\nHowever, the incredible preparation and taste of the food here have kept me coming back any time I can afford a fancy meal!"
"3","I'm not sure how this place stays in business.  Every time I've been there, we are the only table in the restaurant....including a Saturday night at 6:30pm.   Well, maybe it's the fact that they overcharge for the amount of food they give you.  Quality is good, but the portions are too small for what you pay.  You also have to pay for parking (in the garage).   There's not too many Japanese restaurants in Pittsburgh, so if you're in the mood for Japanese,  it's virtually the only place to go."
"3","I was very upset to find out that this theater charged me the admissions price of 5.00 for my 6 month old grand daughter who cannot even sit up alone to take up a seat. I was told by employee's there that everyone is charged a price during the first 2 weeks of a new movie showing. I feel this was a great rip off and she could not take advantage of the free popcorn, so basically I paid 5.00 for the small free popcorn. Very upset."
"3","If you go here, sit outside and enjoy the beautiful view of Pittsburgh! We came here for drinks but the food looked good. Wednesday is their $1 beer special and $5.50 martini night. The martinis are good. The sangria was.... Eh......tasted flat and syrupy. Not what I expected from a sangria for $10."
"3","Egg on the burger wasn't completely cooked. They kept changing TV channels, so you couldn't watch a game all the way through. So we left."
"1","I went there to have a tire checked because it had a slow leak. After a thirty minute wait, they said there was no problem with the tire and that the aluminum wheel was leaking. They put a sealant on the inside of the rim and advised that it was a temporary fix and would leak again in the future. A day later I still had a leak. I took the car to another garage and they found a small hole in my tire within 5 minutes! Oh and they charged half of what NTB did. Take your car somewhere else!"
"4","Get here early! Seats fill up quick!\n\nI love this theater. They always play movies for the longest and they oftentimes play movies that you can't see anywhere else. Very roomy and comfy. \n\nPrices are a little higher and it seems to be always crowded. Parking is a nightmare on a Saturday night."
"4","This is one of my favorite movie theaters in the Charlotte area, despite my lack of enthusiasm for shopping malls.  I normally attend movies in the late afternoons or evenings during the week and I don't purchase snacks or drinks; however, I'm super appreciative of this theater being clean and easy to locate within the mall (down at the end, across from Forever 21).  The movie schedules are great and I have even seen a few movies here that most other theaters do not show.  (For example, Dallas Buyers Club.)  There are electronic ticket kiosks if you don't want to wait in line for a ticket and I've always been a fan of the lighting near the entrance of the theater.  It doesn't really feel like you're in the middle of an outlet mall.  (Thank goodness.)  I'd give this theater five stars if the seats reclined.  :-)"
"5","Large multiplex theater. Theater has $5 movies for showings that are early. IMAX available for a hefty charge. 3d movies show here for cost of 3d glasses. A 3d movie for 3 was about 33 dollars for us. \n\nSnack bar has pizza, chicken tenders, hot dogs, pretzels, ice cream, along with the usual candy, popcorn, and drinks all at inflated prices.  Good selection but be prepared to pay.\n\nCan be a stubs member for $12 a year to get free tickets, snacks, etc. it's free at regal, but they give you $10 for every $100 spent to use for tickets or snacks in addition to snack specials and discounts offered to members on a regular basis.\n\nClean theater. Have been here many times."
"5","Staff is always polite and movie selection is great! Prices aren't too bad and the viewing area is always clean. Only down side is that they don't have student discounts, but that's livable"
"2","This was not a pleasant experience, Firstly, I had fried pickles, which were soggy and greasy, nowhere near as good as I have come to expect from Hooters. The bartender (Jennifer), while not unpleasant to look at, was extremely slow. She walked past my empty beer glass all night; the only way I was able to get a beer was to get her attention, which was difficult, since she was busy fooling around with her phone and doing God knows what else, and ask her point blank for a beer. When I was able to finally order an entree, she recommended at \""Daytona\"" sauce, which was goopy, sickly sweet, and horrible.  The worst, and unforgiveable part, was that there was a mix-up with the tabs, and the manager came over and informed me that I could order no more alcohol, since I had already has TEN beers. I had NOT had ten beers; believe me, if I had wanted to have ten beers, it would have been impossible in the short time I was there, with the inattentive bartender. Rather than argue with these socially-inept , inefficient people, I cashed out and left. have reasonable expectations, and not only did they not meet my expectations, they were egg\\regiously insulting. I come to town often, for business, and could potentially bring a lot of business, as my customers do like Hooters, but I will NOT be back here, Steer clear of this place. Go to the Texas Steak House or one of the other numerous nearby options."
"1","Chicken cooked at wrong temperature... Was completely red. Threw up for 3-4 straight days. Lost business over it too. Fix the kitchen, fix the restaurant... STAY AWAY!"
"2","decent at best.  if you know real cajun this place won't impress you but for the lack of any other option it's passable.  the Rat Toes appetizer is pretty good."
"2","While I still enjoy the atmosphere of Razzoo's, something has changed.  I don't know if I'm older (okay, I know I'm older), or if they've cranked it up a few notches, but their food is now too much for us to eat, and I'm not talking about the price, which is about the same.\n\nEverything on the menu, from the dirty rice to the fried green bean appetizer and the chicken pasta has a kick to it.  Consider yourself warned.  If you want it spicy, then this is probably your place.  But what used to be \""taste with a bit of a bite\"" is now \""spice with very little taste\"".  Or maybe it's just that there is so much spice that it kills the taste buds long enough to remove the taste.  Tough to say that there is a difference.\n\nOn the bright side, the place is fun, and the servers are as friendly as ever - it's just that the food has really gone downhill.\n\nSweet Tea Report:  Not sweet.  At all.  Not in your wildest dreams would you possibly imagine that this tea has ever even thought about being sweet.  I would hate to even try and think what their regular tea taste like because the sweet tea is so not sweet.  Move along."
"1","Nasty! Disgusting. I can't believe I even stepped in the doors."
"2","If I hadn't been born in Louisiana and my family wasn't cajun, I probably could enjoy it.  But when I go to a place that claims to be cajun and I see only pale shadows of the dishes, I come away disappointed.\n\nThis place seems more about the Look of what a non-cajun would expect out of cajuns than what being Acadian really is.  Nowhere to be seen is the wonderful dishes like maquechoux, and boudin, nor were the sides near what I like.\n\nAt least I still have relatives from Lafayette who send me good sausage to cook my own jambalaya and gumbo the right way."
"4","Cool eclectic decor...a cross between Beverly Hillbillies and Swamp People. The menu is very entertaining to read. There is plenty of room between tables so you're not sitting on top of other people. For some reason, I wasn't to adventurous so I got the chopped salad with ranch dressing (had some cajun spices). It was delicious! My brother got the andioulle red beans and rice and devoured it. Hubs got the catfish poboy and had nothing but good things to say about it. (it was huge).\n\nBiggest complement I can can give about this place was the service. We had an incredible waiter who was funny, informative and attentive. \n\nI'll definitely go back and try something else on the menu."
"4","When it comes to Cajun and spicy food, I am a work in progress.  I'm attempting to get my palette better versed in spice.  My boyfriend and I were looking for a change in our typical go-to places when he suggested Razzoo's and boy, did he make a good suggestion!  He had the crawfish etoufee (amazing) and I had a Shrimp Po' Boy and it was MASSIVE.  It was delirious, well spiced and presented.\n\nIs it authentic?  I don't know - I hope to head to New Orleans this winter for a vacation but I can tell you I loved it.  We ate at the bar and the staff was great - They were quick to refill our beers and gave great service.  I loved it, I have been craving it since and I will be back!"
"4","Very nice and helpful.  If you are balling on a budget then this is the best store to visit."
"2","Four stars for the two appetizers (calamari and spicy shrimp)' both were very enjoyable.  The salad was also very good.  \nOne star for the main entrees.  Both mine and the wife's were awful.  I had the tilapia with asparagus.  The asparagus was way over cooked the the fish was very dry.  Wife had a pasta dish and was very disappointed. The kids meals were okay.\nAtmosphere wasn't very appealing since areas were dirty in the waiting area and the dining area near the fireplace.  Wait staff was very inconsistent, our waiter was very neglectful, while the waitress at the table next to us seemed very attentive to her tables and we had to ask her for refills on bread, salad and drinks while our waiter was MIA.\nBottom line, go somewhere else while in the Concord Mills area."
"4","Good Service! I had the usual soup, salad and breadsticks."
"2","We came inside waited for ten minutes to be acknowledge then we had to wait another five to ten minutes  to be seated for a booth as. As we are waiting I seen a booth and the hostess  told me \""that the server was full, so I said okay then once the manager came up she told the hostess to sit us at the same exact booth..... So as we were seated a SPIDER!!!!! crawls across the table.....I'm so done with these MOFOS!!!!!"
"3","Starbucks has become quite the institution here in the good ole' USA. As most folks do, I enjoy their coffee. Generally I'm a Venti Mocha, no whip kind of girl but on occasion I will branch out and try a Columbian Roast or a Frappaccino.\nThe breakfast sandwiches are not the best, but better tasting than McDonald's in my opinion. The bakery items are fine for prepackaged stuff. \nI don't usually go in as it's always crowded, there is a long line (even in the drive thru - plan a few extra minutes for waiting) and for some reason it's always cold. \n\nAll in all I prefer home grown coffee shops or small hole in the wall places but this is, just as it is called, a Starbucks, and nothing more."
"4","Came in for lunch and the place was pretty empty. I believe perhaps they were just opening. I ordered a BFM (Best Friday's Margarita) and the bartender made it with some love. I appreciated that. :-) For lunch I ordered the California Club with sweet potato fries. The food was very fresh. I assumed it was a hot sandwich but instead its a cold one. Not a deal breaker though. I really enjoyed it. It was cool too see the CIAA additions to the restaurant as I am solely in town for this event. Overall, the service was good and the food was good too.."
"4","Fast, polite and the food was good.  The Thai Tacos and fried Mac&Cheese was yummy.  Great burgers as well. This is no culinary stop but good fast food."
"4","Look this is simple. The name of the place is \""Roadhouse\"" as in peanuts in a bucket on the table, throw your shells on the floor, young waiters and waitresses dancing, and STEAK!   If you want a great steak or great chicken at a very reasonable price in a simple laid back ROADHOUSE style establishment then this is great.  This is not fine dining.  Sorry no special separate booths or perfect fitting baby seats or quiet whisper dining w a waiter that is wearing a white apron.  Give me a break.  Simple..... you want great steak at low prices in a simple place then this isn't a bad choice.....you want to cry about booths and baby slings and loud kids, ummm stay home."
"2","We went in because we noticed it wasn't very busy and we wanted to grab a quick bite to eat.  The waitress acknowledged us, brought us 2 out of the 3 drinks we ordered and then she never came back to our table.  After 15 mins we got up and left.  I would leave a 1 star but I reserve that for blatantly rude or disgusting places."
"1","If your not a local dont come here.  From wgat I could see if the bartender or waitress new you they would hang out and talk to you, but we were new to the area and the bar looked interesting. \nTo start the night we sat outside. Asked that the tv channel be changed. Waitress said ok we'll see if we can get that changed.  After an additional 3 times asking she doesn say they can change the channel she says the bartender has been \"" backed up\"". I go inside and the bartender is  talking to the ame group she had been talking to for a while. Later we went in to watch the fight which was on the tvs inside.  I ordered a drink and the bartender told me she was going to make it on the other end of the bar. Expecting me to move to the other end to get it.  Just a sub par place. Has a lot of potential but not going to draw in any new businesses with this type of service."
"2","Sun and Ski is a decent all around Outdoor Sports store.  I have wandered around here many a time looking at various clothing for running and winter sports.  I will say that they lack seriously in the cycling apparel department.  They have 2 racks (1 clearance) for women and it was mostly shorts.  If you are looking for cycling apparel then stick to Bike stores that concentrate on this or buy online.  Their hiking supplies are a little limited as well and pricey but you can find some small items in abundance.  They do however, have helpful staff especially when dealing with their Yakima selection.  All in all, Sun and ski is so general that if you want a good selection in one area of activity then it's best to find a store that specializes in that."
"1","Cannot believe how unhelpful and extremely rude the ladies were to me and other women here. They treat you like you're scum until you go to buy an expensive dress. Would never recommend this place to anyone looking for a nice dress shopping experience."
"1","Tried it and they were out of everything we tried to order. Gave them another try and same thing. We gave up and wont be going back"
"2","Pizza is average.  One step above Cici's as another reviewer commented.  They don't refill the pizzas often enough also....so if someone hordes the only topping combination you would eat...good luck.  Salad bar crappy, small setup means lack of salad topping possibilities.  No marinara on the buffet to dip crust, breadstick, or anything else into.  \n\nSandwiches ordered off the menu (non buffet) are very decent.  Chicken parm and meatball are both a lot of food for the money.  Comes with a sad little bag of Ruffles as I recall =/   ...buffalo wings are very decent for the money.  Only 2 sauce choices for wings but you get a lot for the money.   My GF doesn't like going there, when I suggest it as I'm quickly reminded of a dead roach she found on the booth cushion.  Waiters/waitresses are super friendly, I've never had bad service there."
"4","I've only been in Charlotte for a couple years and this is the first auto garage I've used down here. It's owned and operated by two brothers I believe. They did a great job and worked with me on the price. In the end I feel like they are a very reputable company that won't rip you off. I actually need to have some work done on my wife's car and plan on calling them to do the work."
"1","For a place that just opens pre-made packages and plops them on a salad-bar, I would think that this effort might not have been to challenging. Perhaps I had my hopes up too high.\n\nI went here for a quick bite as I had business in the neighborhood. I must say, I would have done better anywhere else. The salad selection was less than fresh to say the least. A person kept barging out of the back to refill things, and was super surley. Just get in her way and get an elbow.\n\nAfter the salad selection are random canned things. I guess those were ok. I am not sure.\n\nThey also have a \""hot bar\"". This is where things get really depressing. They had a kind-of taco set-up thing going with what appeared to be ground beef. Except it wasn't! It was straight-up textured vegetable protein! Who even does that? I got a baked sweet potato, and that thing had been sitting under a heat lamp for what seemed weeks and was inedible. The soups were just blah. Who serves french onion soup without the topping? The pizzas they had on the platter were less than what you would expect from the cheapest of frozen pizzas.\n\nJust all in all horrible. I left having drank and unsweetened ice tea and left a plate from the all-you-can-eat salad bar totally full.\n\nWhat a waste of time and money. This place is gross."
"3","Yesterday for lunch my friend really wanted to eat here, so in an act of almost unfathomable generosity I said OK!  I know I'm selfish!!!\n\nThe Wait staff seemed like they did not want to be there, though that has no effect on my review!  The seats were very soft and comfortable, though that will not effect the outcome of my rating it is nice to be physically comfortable.\n\nThe food:  Chips, plain, little or no salt, 3 stars!  Salsa, good flavor (better than many), too watered down 3.5 stars.  Steak Fajitas good flavor, better than some, 3.5 stars.  Flour Tortillas 4 stars.  The Pico was better than most 4 stars.   Vegetables, good quality 3.65 stars.  My overall rating of this place is compared to similar Mexican Restaurants.\n\nI can NOT say that I am a fan (so I do not give them four stars) they get 3.25 for me = A -OK!  Though I would not chose to return here  would come back if I really wanted to join my group of friends who chose to.  Many places I would not, so that says something good about this place!"
"4","This Subway has come a long way. It used to have pretty poor, unfriendly service. The teenage gals working there seemed to rather chit-chat than work but I think a manager with a somewhat ironfist may have read them the riot act because service has improved (at least this trip!).\n\nWhere the sandwiches used to be put together half-@$$ed, this time they were made with a little more love. The gals were more interested in greeting us, taking our orders properly, and being fast and efficient with getting everything prepared and paid for. The restaurant itself is very clean and the food very fresh, so it's safe to say there's new management involved.\n\nI have to say that Subway has the best tuna sub on the planet. That is no lie. I'm not sure what it is they do, but that's about the only thing I can ever order here. I have a nephew who worked at one years ago, but he said there was no secret to it.  Adding bacon to it might have something to do with it. You can't go wrong with bacon! I've even seen chocolate-covered bacon but have yet to try it. I'm not big on the lettuce at these joints but I always go with the fresh spinach instead if there's not an ecoli scare happening. The sandwich makers can go a little extreme with the mayo so I have to tell them \""just a little bit\"" and not make the mistake of just saying \""light mayo\"", because they will indeed get the bottle of \""light mayonnaise\"" and slop too much on my sandwich, not realizing I just meant \"" a little bit\"" of mayo. Comprende?\n\nThe breads are all good but I always stick with their wheat, never toasted. I swear I scrape the hell out of my lips on any sub that gets toasted.\n\nNice selection of chips. Nothing like putting them on your sandwich for that extra crunch. They also carry one of the best iced-teas for these type of restaurants called \""Fuze\"". I wish more stores would carry it. Tastier than Lipton's!\n\nFair prices but it gets weird how they judge the prices of a footlong. They can go anywhere from $5 to $9 depending on what's inside. Is there a tuna shortage?\n\nYour pal,\nWalter"
"4","This is one of our go-to inexpensive dinner places. Their margarita's are good and very large if you get anything but the small. The food is good, I'm a fan of the La Mejor and my hubby always gets Pollo con Crema.  Take home boxes are standard for us at Monterrey having left overs for the next day.\n\nThe service can be hit of miss, but typically they are very attentive and food comes out quickly.  The dining room is a bit of a dive and sad.  The booths and tables have seen better days.  It could certainly use a face-lift."
"3","I'm a big Mexican food fan! This Monterrey location in Matthews always seems to hit the spot. Stopped by recently on a Saturday evening for dinner. Got right in! I ordered the chimichangas w/ shredded beef, fried. I know, I know, they do offer an non fried option, too. Great flavors w/ the guac & sour cream & side of refried beans. Topped it off w/ an ice cold Dos Equis. Can you really ever go wrong w/ an ice cold Dos Equis? The wife tried the Taco Salad w/ chicken. I enjoyed that dish as well. Is this my go to Mexican restaurant? No, but on a Saturday night when I'm hungry and not in the mood to wait too long, this is a great option."
"1","Just awful, although I may have given this place two stars if so many people didn't rave about it. Where should i start ....\n\nIn the four months since I've move to South Charlotte I've had more meals at franchises that I did my whole life. It's kind of sad really. The place was packed , which strangely enough that's been a bad omen here in Charlotte.  I found a place at the bar and started off with Jameson neat, that mellows me out ... usually.\n\nI'll skip the usual whining about the service. Italian bread with olive oil and rosemary to dunk it in, fan-tas-tic, I'm starved! But only a supermarket would try to pass that bread as \""eyetalian\"" and the olive oil was 100% tasteless. Throwing in even a drop of balsamic would have overpowered it. One down.\n\nThe Caesar salad arrives, it's just iceberg lettuce with some shaved Wisconsin processed parmesan and a couple of bread croutons. No dressing no nothing. Caesar what???\n\nI ordered pork chops in Marsala sauce and I finally understand why people gave good ratings to Fontanella ... believe or not the sauce here is actually WORSE, little porcini mushrooms totally overpowered by the salt shaker that was emptied in the sauce. And the Marsala forget it, there was NONE to be tasted, what's this prohibition era wine sauce. I wanted to just eat it and put an end to this ordeal, but the salt overdose made it impossible. The executive chef came out and met me. They served another pork chop (although the plate called for two of them) without the salt overdose but again without marsala or any significant seasoning. \n\nBack in the 90s I used to do go to bike week in Daytona quite often. The food was universally complete crap and the so called best restaurants in town (The Olive Garden and the Outback) had people lined up around the block, \nThat's what tonight reminded me of,  A huge crowd feasting on crappy food.\n\nedit: I forgot to mention the \""mashed potato with garlic\"" because there's absolutely nothing to say about it."
"3","We order our food from their carside service.  We found the food to be great, but patience trying to get your food from the carside pickup!!  (over 15 minutes past the time promised and ignored until the manager brought it out!!)"
"2","Waited a really long time to be seated for a mediocre birthday dinner. I ordered some sort of shrimp pasta plate.  Our meal was a long time coming after being seated. My shrimp had gone bad...really bad, so I ordered something meatless. The replacement dish took so long to arrive that I ended up eating part of my wife's  I only had a limited amount of time before an event I had to be at and couldn't wait any longer for my meal. My daughter didn't finish her plate & my wife was underwhelmed by hers (same thing I had).  It just tasted bland to me.\n\nThere are too many alternatives in this town to wait 40 minutes on \""meh\"" entrees that are not inexpensive! That's what makes the world go round though. Some people swear by this chain. Just not my thing."
"5","Queen Nails 7/25/2013\n1819 Matthews Township Pkwy Ste 300\nMatthews, NC 28105\nI have been going to Queen Nails for over a 10 years and will not go anywhere else. They are very clean and sanitary. The attention to detail is wonderful. They are very personable and caring. I am there about every 3 weeks getting a pedicure, gel nails and artwork hand drawn on my nails. Taylor, Rachel, Kathy, Annie and Lana are wonderful. Annie does state of the art brow shaping for $8."
"4","YUM!!!  The boyfriend took me here last night for dinner and what a delight!  My favorite things - beer and burgers!  A great old school spot with a hoppin bar area.  They brew their own beer here and I tried the Lightening Bold Gold and it was perfection!  \n\nThe dinner starts with these complimentary pieces of heaven - I don't know what they are called but there is a picture here someone took.  I have iron will when it comes down to resisting bread before dinner but one bite of these and you will be beggin for more.  They taste like criossants, super light and covered in a sticky warm honey-ish sauce.  Holy Cow - love it!\n\nThey have 16 and 22 oz beer specials Fridays where the 22 oz is $2.50!!!  What!!!  Love it!  And they offer growlers to go for just $9 bucks.  \n\nI got the California burger and it was huge.  Fresh ingredients, carefully made to order.  I swapped out the fries for Chicken and Wild Rice soup and it was fantastic.  There was a little bit of heat in the soup which i LOVE!  Super reasonable prices.\n\nWill definitely be back!  :-D"
"2","How bad is it when you don't want to go to Target?\n\nThe issue I have with this Target location is the crowd capacity. Every weekend it's like Christmas shopping season. You can see the packed parking lot from 51. I personally would rather go to 3 different stores in less crowded areas then go to this target on a weekend. In fact I have driven out of my way to go to Wal-Mart in Indian Trail just so that I don't have to go to this Target. The designers should have doubled or expanded this location a long time ago and now with the addition of the fresh food department to the store I'm sure even more people will be shopping here."
"2","The IHOP is another one of those places that I just don't get, and I don't really understand why, because I make pancakes frequently enough at home.  They have a decent menu and all - in fact it's pretty hefty.  But I can sit there and page through it time and time again without being able to really find something that I crave.  So I end up ordering something that I don't care for, then I get something I don't care for, and eat something I don't really want, and end up unhappy.\n\nThe good news about this particular location is that the staff is nice, but the bad news is that the service can be really, really bad.  Most IHOP locations will have a line at the popular times - usually on Sundays after breakfast.  But this one has a line all the time, even when the restaurant isn't full.  Even if you should get a table, you'll end up waiting.\n\nServers will often keep your glasses full, but that's about it - and don't plan on talking to a manager about it, because they will do everything they can to avoid you.  We watched the table across the divider from us ask - over and over again - if they could speak to the manager.  This went on for probably half an hour, and as soon as they gave up and left, the manager came out.  It was pretty bad.\n\nThe quality of the food is good enough (if you can find something you like), it's just that the service here is pretty bad."
"4","Here on 4/28/12\n\nDecent food for breakfast . Colorado Omelettes was better than anticipated . Had potroast, bacon ,ham ,sausage , and cheese stuffed into and on top of the omlette. Coffee was ground and brewed here and served in the gold pot kept on our table. Syrup served warm in a clean, non sticky caraf. Very good !"
"2","This place is always packed. Why? Am I missing something? Someone please tell me! I have only been for Breakfast and it's moderate at best. That morning I had scrambled eggs which I truly believe were a week old, turkey bacon which was grossly undercooked and pancakes which were light, fluffy and very tasty.\n\nThe service was good. Our waiter was a little shy, probably his first gig but still very nice, polite and attentive.\n\nThe opinion at the table was the pancakes ruled and everything else was unacceptable. With that said, I honestly can't see myself frequenting this place often just for pancakes. I need more to choose from. That's why I ask you to please tell me what I'm missing. Why do so many people frequent this place? Is there a secret menu I don't know about? Am I visiting at the wrong time? What? Tell me!"
"3","The service was awful. It was probably 15 minutes to get menus; three hours to get thru entrees and dessert. We were in absolutely no hurry but geez that is ridiculous. The patio is totally non descript and overlooks a parking lot.  My husband's dinner looked very good, my scallops were fine, served with beet risotto, tasty but there was some sort of puke green sauce that was really weird. The bread pudding was delicious. We walked to music in Stumptown Park after which was nice. A pleasant enough meal but kind of doubt we'll be back."
"5","Excellent food with an intimate feel. I prefer the back patio area. The menu changes almost daily and veggies come from local growers."
"1","Every time we have been here we have been disappointed. We are done. No more chances. There are much better pizza places around here."
"1","I will not shop at this store again.  While they do carry what I need - a prescription dog food needed for my dogs' digestion problems - they refused to sell it to me without a \""prescription card,\"" which I did not have because I just moved to Charlotte and my new vet had not yet mentioned any such thing to me.  It was a Sunday and my vet's office, like just about every other professional practice in Charlotte, is closed on Sundays.  The kicker is that they sold it to my father two weeks earlier without a prescription so the problem isn't that they won't make an exception to their silly policy, but apparently that they just didn't want to make an exception for me.  Either way, it's dog food...and expensive dog food at that.  Do they think my dogs are going to become addicts or something?  No thanks, I won't be returning and giving them my money for all of the expensive dog food that I purchase on a regular basis.  I will find another supplier."
"3","I never thought much of this place but tried it again recently and it was alright.  Nice that they have Old Meck on tap, the beer is bitchin.  I had their chili cheese fries and they were a fail.  It was like that liquid cheese like the jar stuff by frito lay.  The chili was like real chili and made the fries slimey and wet.  I had wings as the main course and they were good, no complaints with them."
"1","Expensive (more than dealership), not fast, and they REALLY do some up-selling."
"4","\""Is it yucky?\"" a friend asked me of the Movies 10 in Matthews. Many discount theaters get a reputation for having sticky seats, funky smells, and screaming children, but the Matthews 10 is an exception to the $2 theater rule. I've had only good experiences there.\n\nOn Mondays, there's a bonus discount. Tickets are only $.50, which is absolutely awesome. While they've got cheap tickets, their concessions are still pretty prices, so you might want to bring along your big purse and stop at the gas station on the way there (if you know what I'm sayin'). \n\nI tend to hit this spot up about once a week, as I'm just not willing to spend what the mainstream theaters are charging for movies. If you wait a month or so after the new stuff comes out, it finds its way almost always to the Matthews 10. \n\nIt's nearby a few fun chain restaurants as well. I have made a whole date night out of Cici's pizza and a Matthews 10 movie for less than $20. It can be done!"
"3","Remember  the days when you could watch a movie for $1?  I don't, but I hear folks reminiscing about them.  Old timer or not, Cinemark is the pretty decent place if you want to watch movies just out of rotation at the major theaters.Admission on the weekends is $2.25!  During the week its only $2 and $1 on Tuesdays.  Located behind the Krispy Kreme in Matthews (just look for the 'Hot' sign), the place looks like Pee Wee Herman's playhouse on the inside.  But I can forgive that.  \n\nThey show movies generally two months after their original release date.  Its your typical movie-fare, but   occasionally they throw in an indie or foreign film.  Look for the CineArts logo on the Showtimes page of the website. \n\nPlease be forewarned however: the concession stand is NOT discount price.  A large popcorn and drink runs $9.  Also, if you're going on a Fri or Sat., there will be a lot of teens.  They have cracked down on teen loitering in recent years, but certain teen-friendly movies might not be fun to watch on the weekend.  However, Cinemark Matthews Movies makes a good cheap date or fills a boring weeknight.  Netflix and Redbox watch out!"
"1","MEAN people.. Our dog is a customer, called at 11:00AM on a Saturday, with our dog howling so loud that you could hear him a block away.  We knew it was his time to put him down.  However, Matthews refused because they were closing at noon.  Can you believe that?  They said to take him to an emergency clinic and we told them we could not afford that.  We had already checked prices weeks before, because we knew it was getting close. We had already been sedating him and giving him pain meds. So,I called again at 11:30 to beg them to take him.  While I was on the phone they mistook me for another customer and said that it was okay, Dr. Pritchett would wait to see their dog, which they were putting down.  Now, that was biased! It was okay for them, but not for us.  Obviously, Dr. Pritchard was already waiting.. I think this was absolutely MEAN, not do take him in.  Where is the passion when you need it??"
"4","Well, not that anyone can properly place doughnuts in the food pyramid, let alone work them into any meal with justification, but Krispy Kreme is a gift from the sweet tooth heavens. If you're passing by and happen to catch that beauteous glowing Hot & Now sign illuminated in your peripheral, it might has well be your birthday. \n\nI've experienced many a doughnut endeavor and never once have I been let down by this little shop of warm, melty, glazed dreams. The staff is always fast and can pull a dozen melt-in-your-mouth glazed in no time. \n\nThe inside is great, too. Fun for little kids to watch the conveyor belt churning out doughnuts. This is a place of happiness. Not just breakfast or snacktime, but pure happiness. \n\nMy only gripe is the accessibility. Located on Independence, it is hard to pull in and then come in through the back, pull in to the drive thru or find a spot  in the adjacent parking lot. All of Charlotte knows how 74 is the bane of motor vehicle existence, so just be prepared. \n\nAbsolutely love Krispy Kreme and all they stand for. Except for maybe their odd choice of spelling, of course! Now, onward for Hot & Now doughnuts!"
"2","I have been to this location many times, and let me say that Einstein's is vastly superior as far as bagels are concerned. That stated, Bruegger's does serve good softwiches...however, I could get better bread and bagels elsewhere."
"3","On a mission to find the wife bagels and this was the closest place around. Well the service was a bit slow but it was to be expected on a holiday saturday around 10am. One of their employees was a bit slow making bagels too but it seemed like he was new. \n\nAnyway we ordered three bagels with cream cheese and a Naked fruit drink and a small coffee, total was $14 dollars, ouch. Wasn't expecting that but maybe the bagels would be amazing...\n\nAh no, the bagels were ok. I've had better ones at Panera or Grinds & Glazes in Blairsville, GA. They were just decent bagels, and the toasting wasn't long enough. I prefer a light char on my bagels and Brueggers just does a light toast. The coffee was good but I probably won't be back just based on the price:food ratio. They do have 'last nights' bagels in a bin just infront of the register that would be a way better deal than what I ordered. I didn't notice it until I was sitting down, oh well. Maybe you can snag those up if your there."
"1","It was terrible, terrible, terrible. The lady preparing the bagel for my daughter  couldn't even make a straight cut, the peanut-butter and jelly was all over the place. How hard is it to prepare an appealing peanut-butter and jelly bagel???? The end result looked like she just threw up all over it. My bagel wasn't fresh and when she pulled out the humus, it had a crust on it like an old product would have. It was one of the most terrible Sunday breakfasts I've ever had. I will never ever return!"
"4","Came here frequently in college. Fell in love with the green curry. I had the chance to go to Thailand for myself and eat some of the dishes I learned to love at Thai Taste - and Thai Taste's versions of the dishes are amazing."
"3","After a day at the park I was really hungry and not in the mood for the usual fare on East blvd. so I trekked up to Thai Taste. Walking inside it was the usual traditional Thai decor. The restaurant was small and cozy, but I imagine if I had went at a busier time it might have just felt crowded.\n\nThe menu is laid out so you pick your entr\u00e9e and combo it with choice of meat. I went for the green curry with chicken. Usually when I have green curry it has a decent kick to it due to the paste being made from green chilies and balances out the sweetness of the coconut. This green curry while pretty aromatic seriously lacked some much needed heat. After reading some reviews on here though I'll probably try it again and request it extra hot.\n\nThe prices are pretty reasonable and the service is attentive enough to keep my water glass full which is much appreciated! My meal arrived in a very timely manner and I left full and happy. Probably one of the better Thai places I've been to in Charlotte, I'll have to come back and try out their Pad Thai along with a hopefully spicier green curry."
"4","Solid. Not out of this world, but Thai Taste is solid.  The prices are reasonable, and whenever I need my Pad See Ew fix, I'll head to TT.  There are restaurants light years better in Boston and Chicago, but for now, TT will do. \n\nThe ambiance is kind of old school, tables with plastic covers the random wood-carving, and a hammock hanging from the ceiling with a fake person napping inside.  It's not my favorite, but hey, it adds to the charm. \n\nSince this place has been reviewed so many times, I'll just give my 2-cent tip. Lunch specials are a great value.  For about $6 or $7 bucks, depending on the protein you pick, you'll get an entree (some with rice), a spring roll, soup and iced tea.  (Iced tea and soup not included if you get lunch special take out.) \n\nI've gotten the squash special, which is stir-fried yellow squash and protein of choice...that was an insane $12.95 by comparison.  (The dish itself was OK, not as flavorful as the Pad See Ew and the squash for some reason had a squeaky sound whenever I bit into them.) \n\nOverall, it's a nice neighborhood joint where the service is good, and you will have a good meal.  Maybe not stellar, out-of-this-world great (like Paula Deen would say) but you'll leave happy and very full."
"3","Seeking fried goodness and cheap beer? Belly on up to Vinnie's. And maybe bring some stretchy pants. \n\nI've been to Vinnie's a few times and I'm always intrigued by their super cheap brew specials (as Michael E. points out). This is a great little spot to grab a beer and some grub and watch the game. The waitresses here are always friendly and sport teeny little tanks - which I'm sure is a big hit with the guys. \n\nI'm really happy that smoking is outlawed indoors, as this place used to be almost unbearable in the evenings. No one likes to have a big side of smoke with their shrimp po' boy. And by the way, although a ton of their menu is fried (and well made), they do offer a great crab leg special on Monday nights that I am just itching to try. \n\nPer hubs, this is an amazing place to score oysters, too! \n\nNow...which Monday am I going to plant myself for unlimited crab legs...?"
"1","Nicole...... this place may have cheap beer  I guess if cheap beer is all your going after if you even can get one! I thought I would try this place out while  waiting on some friends that where at the Sugarland Concert   it was   7 pm not very busy 15 minutes no server what do  they do when its busy? Come on a million bleach blondes in this city that want to make big tips ... ..Then why do you not hire them? Terrible service with a   brain like Walmart people will always come in ! \n          To many places in Charlotte for a cold beer . Sitting in the parking lot  watching people sitting on a bench looking in space not saying a word making love to a Bud not saying a word. \n            GREAT PLACE.     NOT!"
"4","Yes, this place is a little rough with lots of blue collar customers. Great beer specials and wonderful oysters on the half shell, only 35 cents each M- F from 5til 7 pm. Fresh seafood baskets of shrimp, fish scallops and sides.\nExcellent waitress, Ashley, very attentive to service. Other location in Matthews closed thank God, what a dump.....great place if you wanted a fight.\nSouth Blvd is good stuff"
"1","This restaurant closed on 12/16/2012."
"1","Time for an update.  I will say we had no problems with this company when renting, paying our rent, and living peacefully with no contact as we had no problems with the rental property.  However, this company is very shady.\n\nWe knew our lease was expiring at the end of April, and had a feeling they would go up on rent as they always do each year.  Luckily we were smart and decided to look for a new place early on in the event the rent did go up.  \n\nThis is where the shady part comes in.  You have to give Talley a 30 day notice (March 31 for us) your intention of how you would like to continue your lease by either extending another year (at a higher rate) or extending month to month (yet an even higher rate).  Or you have to give Talley a 45 day notice if you intend to vacate (March 16 for us (a weekend date which they are not open)).  They did not send us the letter of their intention on how or if they were going to increase the rate until the week of March 10, so we actually did not receive it in the mail until Wednesday, March 12.  So if you wanted to move out, whether you could afford the new rate or just did not want to pay their new rate (later for us), you had 2 days to make a decision.  Like I said, since it is their thing to increase rent each time, we were ahead of the ball and knew if they increased, we would leave.  If they expect renters to give them proper notice, they should be a good company and give us proper notice to make our decision.\n\nWe left and now the property is listed for rent at the price we were paying (so they couldn't give us that price as good tenants, instead they would rather let it sit and wait to be rented), they could have had us for another year, plus.  The only positive I can say from this is that we moved out and received our deposit back in a timely manner.  \n\nOut of all the rental properties and companies I have dealt with, Talley is my least favorite and I would steer clear from them."
"2","my roomie and i have been trying out all the east blvd. restaurants since we moved in the neighborhood about 2 months ago. this place is my least favorite so far. the service took forever- it was about 10 minutes before we even got our drinks. the food was just meh. our waiter was not very attentive. with all the other great options on the block, i doubt we'll be going back anytime soon."
"3","While I've actually never been skiing or snowboarding, I checked this place out. Located on East, the building is an old, stand alone building between large trees. There are 2 sections to the store, the shop section & the rental section.\n\nI checked out the shop area & they have a lot of ski & snowboard options. They also have a lot of cold weather clothing, from your major brands, from light fleece jackets to thick ski/snowboard jackets. If you could wear it on the slope, they have it for you in lots of styles.The prices seemed pretty reasonable too, but what do I know about ski prices?\n\nIf I spent a lot of time on the slopes, I would probably visit Alpine Ski Center a lot more often. They have a good selection of seemingly everything you would need at what seems like reasonable prices."
"5","This is one of the better places in Charlotte for good food and nice atmosphere.  The food is above average to great depending on what you get.  I like the Salmon.  There is also a nice outdoor space during the warmer months."
"4","You have to try the Seared Ahi Tuna Salad. It's light for dinner, put some of the wasabi dressing on the soy sauce and put it over your salad. \n\nThe portobello burger is also great. I really like the place, good service, good location and always something new to try.\n\n** Please fix the espresso machine, every time I go there .... \""we are waiting for this piece that come from Italy bla bla bla\"""
"3","Cute little spot! Nice ambiance, ok food. The BF & I ate here for our birthday dinner over the summer. Honestly the only reason why I wanted to come here was because I was curious about the Matilda Wong.. it was even better than I imagined.. seriously drop what you're doing & get. it. NOW\n\nWe started off with the Sweet Potato Ravioli with the Gorgonzola Cream sauce. Four pieces of delicious ravioli, but I didn't really care for the creamy sauce- it was a little too rich & salty for my taste. LOVED the ravioli itself though. It was topped with walnuts & served with some bread. \n\nFor entrees, BF got the Hanger Steak & I tried the Muffuletta Pizza without meat. BF liked the steak, but my pizza, while it looked good, was so damn salty! Must be because of the olive spread but jeez.. Nothing that another Matilda Wong couldn't remedy though :)\n\nWe split a dessert, but I don't remember what it was.. it had been a few months since we ate here. Guess that means it wasn't horrible, but also wasn't memorable :(\n\nI would come here again & try a different entree.. perhaps the Farro Saute? I found the prices to be pretty reasonable: $12 for ravioli, $12 for the pizza, & I think around $20 for the steak, probably under $10 for the dessert .. & $11 for each mini pitcher of the Wong.. hell yeah"
"4","A very nice place. I thoroughly enjoyed my lunch, my salad was nice and fresh and my guess enjoyed their meals also. The view is very nice if you get a window seat and the service is very efficient and I would recommend it to a friend. Anytime you're in Charlotte stop by and have a nice meal there."
"1","My boyfriend and I came here for one of our very first dates and since then have come back to 300 East often for special occassions. We request the same booth each time, and have yet to have a bad experience... until last night. \n\nWe had dinner at 300 East yesterday evening to celebrate my birthday. After being seated, we ordered drinks and my boyfriend let our waiter, Michael, know it was my birthday as he was looking at my ID. The point here is that he knew it was a special occassion.\n\nOur appetizer came and was great, however when our meal came my gorgonzola filet was so undercooked that it was actually unappetizing. We waited for Michael to return, however after about ten minutes finally had to walk up to the bar to flag down a waiter to send him over. He did not apologize for the steak coming out raw, but did take it back to the kitchen. Another ten minutes later he returned with my meal. The steak, which was the original one served to me, was now a mangled piece of unedible meat. Tough to cut or chew, and needless to say less than enjoyable. After a bite or two, I had lost my appetitie. \n\nWhen he came back to our table, he asked if I was still working on my meal or if I'd like a box. I said no, and before I could even get out that the meal was not up to par and quite frankly inedible, he had walked away with the dish, again with no apology.\n\nSadly, we were still charged the $23 for the meal which was the most frustrating part. It's one thing to be served a horrible meal, but another to feel as though the restaurant/waiter does nothing to make it right either by returning with a meal that is as ordered, or after a second attempt removing the item from the bill.. or really even just a simple apology and some sensitivity to the fact that we were here for a special occassion, of which he was fully aware. \n\nNeedless to say, the message was received from 300 East that they do not want our business, so we will no longer return to 300 East for our special occassions."
"4","This place never disappoints.  I have never had a bad meal here.  There are always plenty of vegetarian selections to choose from.  I recommend making a reservation as they are always busy!"
"5","I love the atmosphere at 300 East. It is very cozy and intimate, great for a date night. The food is always really good, as is the service. I especially love the baked goat cheese appetizer and the filet. So good!"
"5","This is the best place for burritos in Charlotte.  Particularly recommend the vegetarian burrito.  Great atmosphere, cool staff and music, easily accessible from downtown, Dilworth, and South End.  As good as any burritos I've had in cities known for their burrito- like food, including LA."
"2","This place has everything I could want in a rad burrito joint, but good burritos: hard beans (with watery bean juice); mushy flavorless rice; skimpy on the meat innards. Get anything but...      (the burrito)\n\nI do like the other menu items, but a burrito joint MUST have good burritos."
"5","I've heard legends and tall tales about Phat Burrito for years now.  I feel like every time someone brings up Johnny Burrito or Chipotle in Best Burrito Conversations, someone inevitably chimes in with a vote for Phat Burrito.  But just like the talk of legends such as Big Foot and the Loch Nest Monster, I thought Phat Burrito was just that;  talk. \n\nWith that being said, I went to Phat Burrito (PB) this afternoon for lunch.  This was my first and only time going to Phat Burrito and beyond what was contained in the menu online (http://www.phatburrito.com/home/phatburrito-menu.php), I really didn't know what to expect.  First thing that stood out to me was the tricky parking situation at PB.  Just like the mafia, its easy to get in, but hard to get out.  \n\nUpon parking, and going inside, I noticed the inside felt tight and and bit cramped.  There were plenty of people already sitting at tables and a few peeps standing in line placing orders.  My friend ordered the steak burrito (w/black beans, sour cream, but no guac).  I ordered the BBQ Steak burrito (w/ refried beans and both sour cream and guac).  While we waited for our burritos to be made, we went to the little salsa bar in the back and fixed ourselves a few cups of the different salsas.  I heard someone yell, \""TREY!\"" from behind the counter and I knew our burritos were ready to be devoured.  \n\nThe BBQ STEAK Burrito I ordered was splendid.  There seemed to be plenty of steak (they didn't short me on the meats as others have stated).  The BBQ flavor was slow to hit me, but after a few moments of chewing...THERE it is!  That sweet BBQ sauce amalgamated well with the guac, cheese, sour cream, refried beans and the freshly made salsa.  Just like a colony of ants, all of the ingredients worked as one.  It was unlike any other taste I've ever experienced, and instantly had me wanting to come back again!  I tasted my friend's steak burrito and can say it was not nearly as good as the BBQ STEAK burrito.  I also think you have to add both GUAC and SOUR CREAM to maximize your taste experience.  Nonetheless, it was still well above par.  \n\nThe service was great.  The bro who took our order was cool, and very personable.  I can concur with other reviews which mentioned that the inside was a little grimy.  While I appreciated that aspect of PB, my date was a bit turned off by it.  \n\nToday, Phat Burrito made me a believer.  Today I found out that legends of magical burritos aren't the stuff of legends at all - they are indeed real...Real good and tasty, that is...and just like Arnold, \""I'll BE BACK.\"""
"2","Oh Phat Burrito...where do I even start?  Well, being a southern California native and a Blatina (that's black Latina for those of you who don't know lol,,,it's okay, you can use it too), I have pretty high expectations for burritos. I've been running all over Charlotte looking for Mexican food that is at least comparable to the restaurants and taco shops posted on every corner of San Diego, and I'm sad to say that Phat Burrito fell short of my expectations. Funny thing is, I decided to check it out based on a good review posted by another former California resident. Now that you know a little bit about my background allow me to detail my experience at this place for you.\n\nThe Food: If my review were based solely on the food, I probably would have given Phat Burrito 3 stars. The burritos are served on really big tortillas that are stuffed to the max (if you need a comparison, think Chipotle). I ordered a chicken burrito which came packed with black beans, rice, chicken, cheese, and sour cream. Sounds really yummy right!? It was Aight. The rice was kind of undercooked and although there was plenty to nibble at, it was seriously lacking in flavor. The one plus was the fresh salsa bar (which usually comes standard at taco shops in Cali). I tried the green tomatillo salsa and it saved my burrito's life! It was mild and had an awesome combination of lime and cilantro that excited me. \n\nThe Place: Please be warned that if you read any further and you are a fan of Phat Burrito, your feelings may be hurt because I am about to be brutally honest. \nThe parking lot was cramped (already been said), but there was plenty of parking when I went so I had no problem with that. The guy at the counter is responsible for the second star. He was super friendly and enthusiastic. Gave me a minute to explore the menu before asking if I needed help and offering his suggestions which I appreciated. I sat down to indulge in what I expected to be a mind-blowing burrito, and two women sat in the booth next to mine. Halfway through my PB, one of the ladies started making a discrete fuss about something. That's when I saw it! The roach crawling up the side of the counter! The awesome guy at the register was able to SPLAT it before it got too far, but I was still in shock. If there is one thing I abhor more than bad customer service when dining out, it's bug eyed bugs! C'mon now, even if you have a bug or two here and there (let's be real ppl, it happens more often than you'd think), at least keep it concealed while I'm eating lol. It did appear to be running in from the front door area so I  gave them the benefit of the doubt and decided he came from outside and that he was the only one. Needless to say, I was full. But THEN, on my way to my car I ran into a cockroach of a different sort. The old kind that likes to pick up and hit on seemingly innocent young ladies in the parking lot. Ironically he said he knew the owner and that he knew my experience had to have been top notch...I didn't have the heart (or the time) to tell him about what had just taken place. \n\nI realize that this is long, but I imagine it will help someone somewhere make an informed decision. I hate doing reviews like this because I know this place has a faithful customer base and a lot of potential, but until someone can assure me that they are pest free I don't think I can make my way back to give the burrito a second chance :("
"5","Fish tacos,  how could you go wrong with these!"
"2","well it was the best we found in charlotte in the first 4 hours. we met the hot guy at the bar and his hot d.j. fella. they didn't go home wth us. which pissed us off. \n\nso far charlette is making me angry and bored."
"2","OK, what is everyone else seeing here that I didn't?  Yeah, I went for a weekday lunch instead of for Sunday brunch but shouldn't it still be at least a good experience?\n\nOn the plus side, the physical space is special - lots of exposed brick, high ceilings, worn wood floors, lots of windows for natural light.  The restaurant was only about 1/3 full at 12:30 pm on a Wednesday.  It is definitely NOT handicapped accessible.  The only access to the space is a very long, very steep flight of stairs.  (Even the server told us that cases of food, wine and beer kegs have to be lugged up those stairs, there isn't even a freight elevator in the building.)\n\nI ordered the potato bisque (a menu staple) and the chef salad special.  Our server forgot my soup and brought it out after she'd served my entree salad.  The meats in the salad seemed like cold cuts - in fact, rather than being served julienned or chopped in the salad, they were simply layered on - rounds pieces of cold cuts in the salad!  The ranch dressing was likely homemade but was runny in texture and bland in flavor.  My chocolate cake dessert was okay - but not $7 worth of okay.\n\nMy companion enjoyed the crab cake on top of an otherwise ordinary looking salad and she raved about the tiramisu.\n\nOur server does get points for assisting my companion with a wine selection.  She brought out two bottles, let my aunt try both and make a selection.  She even let the unchosed sample stay on the table instead of quickly whisking it back to the bar.\n\nParking is a private lot off of South Blvd - but it's very easy to miss the entrance to the parking lot - and once you miss it, you can't access it from any of the neighboring parking lots either!\n\nMaybe I'll try again with a Sunday brunch - but the experience will have to be world class amazing to erase my memory of this lunch."
"2","My friend and I used the recent $25 for $50 Groupon to check out Pewter Rose on a Saturday night. \n\nHonestly, I thought it was a little bit on the pricey side for what it was so I'm glad that we had the coupon. The atmosphere was pleasant but a little kitschy and I kind of felt that plastic tablecloths were inappropriate when you're charging $20+ a plate. \n\nThat said, it was absolutely packed in there. We had reservations for 8pm and arrived right on time and the hostess was able to find us a seat within about 5 minutes. However the first thing out waiter said was essentially \""We're really busy tonight so I hope you're prepared to wait a while for your food\"". We weren't in any rush and agreed that was fine. The service was good, our waiter was very attentive and kept our water glasses filled but even though we ordered as soon as we were able to, it was after 8:30 before we got our appetizer and 9:20, and honestly that was more waiting than I had expected to do. While the restaurant was full, it is not *that* large. \n\nI had the seafood risotto and it was pretty delicious and I would eat it again. My friend had the herb encrusted lamb and while it was good, we both found it to be overly salty. \n\nI might come back and try the brunch but I don't think I'd pay full price for the dinner."
"2","We had brunch here this morning and while the food was great, the service was horrible.  Also, it was great to find a steak knife on top of the toilet paper dispenser in the ladies room, glad no one's lottle girl found this.  I'm soo disappointed, now I'm gonna have to find a new place for brunch!  This place needs to get their s**t together, not pro!"
"1","I went to Pewter Rose this morning with my girlfriend for Saturday brunch, very much looking forward to experiencing first-hand a menu that seemed incredibly promising. \n\nIf only we'd left Pewter Rose as a lovely idea, rather than experiencing it in person. \n\nAs of today, the sanitation rating at Pewter Rose was 93.5% - Problem #1.\nAfter being seated, we began to discover potential reasons that 93.5 was the best they could do - even in a mostly empty dining room, the glasses and silverware on our table looked as though it had been picked out of a bin of dirty dishes - Problem #2.\nWhile perhaps stellar service or amazing food could have compensated for either the low sanitation rating or dirty dishes, we decided after sitting at our table - again, in a mostly empty dining room - for more than 10 minutes without seeing a waitperson to leave before wasting any more time.\n\nSo. Low sanitation rating, dirty dishes, and NO service. Maybe there are days where service is perfect, dishes are spotless, and they actually want to serve food. Today was apparently not one of those days - and it's not worth gambling that it will be a day for actual service in the future."
"4","I've been going here since they were in the old location up on East Blvd.  The staff is friendly and knowledgeable, and their hours are convenient for me."
"4","I went out to Outback for a light snack. I was seated promptly without any delays. My server was very attentive and helpful with the menu. I ordered the side salad along with the soup for the day. The salad was fresh and crisp and I promise they have the best garlic croutons. The soup was better than I expected it was a creamy onion and cheese soup. And of course they brought out their famous bread and butter!"
"4","I'm so glad that I was introduced to this place!  First off, it's host to the second Not Just Coffee in the area.  I'd visit again for the coffee alone!  It's nice to grab a cup of coffee and check out the rest of the vendors.  Bakeries with sweets and bread to sample, a fresh pickle vendor with samples, farmers market selections, fresh fish....wow.\n\nSaturday is the best day of the week to go because that's when you're likely to experience all of the vendors.  The trick is to get there early.  Several of the vendors only bring a limited supply of their offerings.  If you get there too late the best things are gone!  I only wish that they were open on Sundays!\n\nHit them up for some of the best pimento cheese, freshest bread and largest sweet potatoes around!  Invite me over when you're serving any of the above!"
"2","I really wanted to like Bonterra. I really REALLY wanted to enjoy it...but it was just disappointing. My husband and I ordered a variety of items off the menu - an array of appetizers, entrees and wine and nothing really \""wowed\"" us. The worst part of it all, though, was the service. Maybe the server was just having an off night, but he was very short with us, only checked on us twice during the entire time (once was to greet and the second was to drop off the check with no thank you whatsoever). Other servers dropped off our food (which is completely fine)...but the whole experience was a let down. When you spend that kind of money on a meal ($200+) you really want to be taken care of - and it seemed like no one cared at all."
"3","It's a restaurant in a church!  What a unique twist in fine dining. \n\n1) BBQ Duck Spring Roll- this is not my favorite dish.  The BBQ overpowered the duck and made this dish into a salty mess.  Also, the portion is ity bity- one spring roll cut into 4 mini pieces.  On the contrary, the menu indicates that this dish was featured in the Taste of the NFL.\n\n2) Maple Leaf Farms Duck Breast- now we're talking!  Thought I'd give duck another chance and Bonterra proved itself.  This dish is simply phenomenal!  My duck was juicy, flavorful, and the portion was decent.  The quinoa and corn slaw added a tasteful zing to the dish making it unforgettable!\n\n3) Veal Porterhouse- The meat was prepared with the right amount of flavor and tenderness as evidenced by my fiance finishing the entire plate in record time!  My one bite of his plate also led me to believe that the cook did a wonderful job with the veal.\n\nJust a side note, the restaurant has valet parking available but parking could be limited, especially on weekends.  We had to park in the shopping center next door.  Enjoy!"
"2","I've adopted from local city humane societies before and it was Fantastic! This was unfortunately NOT THE CASE here.\n \nIf you are going to work with this organization on adopting a new family member. Please make sure you have enough patience to handle their process.\n \nThey really need to tweak their adoption process. It takes days for them to approve you for adoption, which means it's better to get approved before you fall in love with any of their visiting members.\n \nUnfortunately we had fallen in love already, so we had another feeling of loss. Which is hard, but there were other dogs that caught our eye, but even that was a mess. We waited for the group of dogs to get fed and 30 minutes later the dog we had waited for was visiting with another family that had just walked in. We were asked to wait again for the dog to have a break from visiting and when the dog came out again we fell in love.\n \nWe went to the front to complete the adoption and what we were told only 35 minutes prior had all of sudden changed. Originally we were told that we could come in the next day with our dog for a meet/greet and complete the adoption then. Instead, we were told that they will file our adoption request with our approved adoption application and \""let us know\"".\n \nI was confused, why everything was coming to a halt again, but I never found out the answer, nor did I ever get a return phone call from them.\n \nMy family and I moved on and had a FANTASTIC adoption experience with a organization that I feel has more heart and compassion and is definitely always going to be a part of my life from now on. Please look at the NORTH MECKLENBURG ANIMAL RESCUE and help these people give a great home to animals."
"3","Lots of really neat, unique stuff - but I kind of expected more.  Interesting location and good space and layout.  I've definitely bought a few cards there!"
"4","When you don't know what to get for someone, you should stop by Paper Skyscraper. \n\nI have to agree with the other reviewers...this store has such fun and unique gifts. They have a wonderful variety of cards as well. While you are shopping for someone else, you can definitely entertain yourself in the process. \n\nThey have a great variety of notepads, jewelry accessories, key chains, home decor, music, books...just a little of everything fun and whimsical."
"5","Paper Skyscraper is a fantastic and fun store. They have a little bit of everything. Everyone that works there are always so helpful and nice. This is a store that when my friends come from out of town, we always take them to shop here. Everyone loves it!"
"3","Man this place is so overrated. The gas station on south and east has way better chicken!!  I'm also not a big fan of their potato rounds(the gas station has wedges).  I also feel like I'm in 1950 as the two cashiers are white old ladies and the 7 people sweating in the kitchen are all black.  There is also no dining-in.  Not thats a problem with me, just giving the heads up."
"3","While I don't agree with those that say it's the best fried chicken in the world, I do agree that it's a great local find in Charlotte with really good fried food. It fits perfectly well into the Southend scene and offers locals and out-of-towners an equally god experience. The place is packed by 11am and does not slow down until it closes or the food runs out for the day. They only take cash, so make sure you check the wallet before hand and don't be scared off by the people standing around the sidewalk as it's normal. You'll order quick, get your food quick and be expected to leave quick so the next person in line can get their order on. They have fried chicken and fish...for me, chicken all day long. Add some hush puppies and slaw and it's a good day. Go see for yourself!"
"4","I had to try this chicken! It was good! I got the 1/4 white dinner.\nThe wing was ok, but the breast was really good! Not too greasy, not overcooked, seasoned well.\nI picked at the potato rounds, cole slaw and hushpuppies; they were not bad.\n\nI should have brought cash with me, but since there was an ATM inside, I figured it would be ok....BUT...the ATM inside failed for me; it did not read my card. I went to a BofA ATM and came back.\n\nI did not have a long wait since the dinner was already prepared and boxed.\n\nPrice's is worth trying again...just bring cash...don't let the ATM inside fail you as it did for me!"
"5","Simply put, the best fried chicken I have ever had! Mind you, I'm no connoisseur, but this was 110% legit; crunchy, juicy & ripe with flavor."
"4","as far as fried chicken goes, this place is great!!!! Beware of the hours and they only take cash. Deffinetly worth a visit."
"5","Hands down the best fried chicken in the south!!! It's the perfect balance of crispy outside, juicy inside! \n\nThe place is very unique as it doesn't have seating. You order up and there are a dozen employees working the fryers! \n\nThey charge 85 cents for canned soda and 5 cents for hot sauce, but you have to have hot sauce on this chicken.  They are cash only so be prepared!\n\nI was put into a solid 30 minute food coma after eating this chicken as it's very greasy! But completely worth it and will return soon! ...just not for lunch during a work day! \n\nI suggest eating there on a Saturday or Sunday when it's nice outside so you can just hang outside of the building."
"4","Price's may just be the best lunch value in Charlotte. Eight bucks bought me a lunch plate piled with a juicy pair of chicken wings, hush puppies and fries. Is it the best fried chicken in the South? How the hell should I know? But it's damn good food, and a local institution that'll kept you coming back again and again."
"4","Best fried chicken anywhere... The only reason for the 4 stars is because their side options are lacking quite a bit... I have gotten used to having mashed potatoes and gravy and a biscuit with my fried chicken... maybe some mac and cheese.  Here you have picnic sides (potato salad, tater tots, etc...)  But the chicken is well worth the trip alone and it's extremely affordable and not processed cheap chicken.  I recommend just getting a \""whole bird\"" and have at it with a friend or 2.. more than that and you are going to fight over the last pieces for sure! \n\nThe place is an older building that looks like a front for a crack house or drug smuggling operation but if it ain't broke.....   the people are extremely friendly and service is pretty fast depending on the time of day that you go.  Saturdays a great time to try it for the first time and take it for a picnic or just lunch... \n\nWith that being said...  \n\nNOTE: NOT OPEN ON SUNDAY OR MONDAY!!!  You don't want the same disappointment I had when I tried to go for lunch one Monday to be denied at the door."
"3","The place is fine, but a bit loud when crowded. Plenty of people with laptops and couples chatting away. The coffee was standard fare, as in sugary and tasty. The two things that I noticed are the number of tables made it feel crowded even when the number of people dwindled, and the bathroom was not the cleanest I have seen in other stores. Although not my favorite place, it's a good place to pop in or stay awhile, just a bit tight if at capacity. I would return."
"3","The place was less crowded this time and the restrooms were a bit cleaner. The restrooms do look and smell like they could use a good bleachy scrubdown, walls and all. The drinks were tasty and service quite friendly."
"5","My family has used Gibson's for many years. I have always been happy with the service I received, and their prices were much lower than dealership quotes. \n\nThe guys there have always taken the time to explain any repairs and give different options with NO PRESSURE! As a female who has no understanding of car repairs, I really appreciate having trustworthy folks to leave my ride with!  They do not have Saturday hours, but that isn't enough for me to take off a star from my review in this case."
"4","Funky, spunky....just give me the soup!!!  Believe it or not, but this place has THE best soup in Charlotte!  Don't be afraid to browse around the eclectic shop with many many organic & natural (genuinely) wares...."
"4","I was honestly just shocked to find Gluten Free pizza`so close to home!  While I can't vouch for the reguar pizza, I would recommend the GF pizza without a doubt.  The only downside is that it takes a much longer time to prepare, but I don't think that's the fault of Fuel.  The people are always friendly and more than happy to keep us entertained while we wait for our pizza!"
"4","We've been to Sullivan's 5 times.  \nThe first time was fantastic and full price.\nThe second time was Restaurant week.\nThe 3rd, 4th, and 5th was for their Sunday Prime Time special for various occasions.\n\nFirst thing I have to say is AVOID RESTAURANT WEEK.  They're way over crowded, the menu is limited, and you're going to wait.\n\nSecond thing... DEFINITELY hit their Sunday Prime Time Special.  For $32, you get twice the selection as restaurant week, and the food is prepared fresh.\n\nThird... get the Bananas Foster Bread Pudding for dessert.  It's awesome.  \n\nFourth... highly recommend Renee as a server.  She was attentive, friendly, helpful, and on top of things.  \n\nSo in conclusion... 5 stars for Renee, the Sunday Prime Time Special & the bread pudding.\n\n2 stars for restaurant week (and take any reviews written during restaurant week with a grain of salt)."
"3","Previously, I have only been to Sullivan's to hang out in the cocktail area & order from the bar menu, but this review is for dinner in the dining room.  \n\nNow, generally, when I get to pick the place, my first choice would NOT be a chain restuarant, even an upscale one.  But, as it turns out, we had a gift card that could be used at either Del Frisco's or Sullivans. So, I went online to research menus ahead of time. Based on the menu (specifically the Ahi Tuna steak entree) I decided that we should go to Sullivans.    \n\nNeedless to say, I was SUPER DISAPPOINTED to learn that they were out of Ahi tuna since that was the whole reason I decided to opt for Sullivans.  BUMMER!!  (I could see a smaller locally owned place running out of a popular menu item, but a huge corporate chain like Sullivans should have a better idea from their POS system about how much of certain items to keep on hand in the restarurant at any given time.)  So, I purused the menu to explore my options...sadly for those who don't eat steak (like me), the rest of the seafood or poultry options were not really exciting.  Oh well, c'est la vie.\n\nBut, as a small consolation prize, they had the Knockout martini on special for $6 (which normally is around $12)... so I started with that.  The knockout is made of clementine vodka that has fresh pineapple steeping in it for at least a week.   It was somewhat sweet, but not cloyingly so. I enjoyed it very much. 4.5 stars. \n\nI decided to opt for one of the Sunday Prime-time specials.  For $34 a person, you can select one item from each of the following categories (however, beware, they have fairly limited options in each category):  (1.) Salad or soup,  (2.) An entree, (3.) A side dish, and  (4.) Dessert.\n\nTo go with my entree, I ordered with a glass of Sauvignon Blanc.  For $8, I got a fairly generous pour of an ok wine. 3 stars. \n\nI started with the wedge salad.  3.5 stars.  The salad was huge and slathered with lots of bleu cheese dressing and a little finely chopped tomato. (At least they aren't one of those restaraurants that feels compelled to automatically throw bacon on everything.  I was glad this salad comes without.)\n\nFor my entree, I went with the salmon w/buerre blanc sauce.  The salmon was a decent size and thankfully was not overcooked. The sauce wouldn't have been my first choice if there were other options, but it tasted fine.  Overall, I would give this item 4 stars. \n\nThe side dishes on the special menu are very limited, and unfortuantely didn't include asparagus.  So, I went with the only other green option, the creamed spinach.  This dish was loaded with parmesan cheese and cream. It was ok, but I couldn't eat much of it because it was way too rich. 3 stars. \n\nThe dessert was fairly disappointing from my standpoint.  I love a good bread pudding, so I was excited about trying the Bannas Foster bread pudding.  This was made in individual ramekins and had a couple of slices of bananas in it.  It was also topped with ice cream, whip cream, and a drizzle of what looked like a carmel sauce.  Sadly, it was not very flavorful and the bread pudding had almost a rubbery texture. 2 stars.  \n\nDavid also got the wedge salad and chose the filet mignon for his entree.  He said the steak was over-salted.  He also chose mushrooms for his side and I tasted them - they were also a little over-salted. I couldn't eat more than a couple of these. For his dessert, he got the cheesecake to take home, since our server told us that we might want to split one dessert in house and take the other one to go (this  was a good suggestion because otherwise, it would be way too much!)  He also ordered a Highland Oatmeal Porter to go with his steak. \n\nOur server was nice, but the service was only ok - not great. One small thing we noticed is that some tables had bread served to them and some (like ours) did not.  Since this was my first time eating in the dining room at Sullivans, I don't know if you were supposed to order the bread, or if the server just forgot to bring it.  (Not a huge deal, but it would have been a nice touch.)   Another small thing I noticed was no manager going around the dining room to greet patrons. \n\nOverall, I was just not impressed given that our total bill came to $94 before tip. \n  \nI would come back here to meet friends for cocktails & casual bites from the bar menu, but I would not come back for a full-fledged dinner.  There are just too many other great restaurants in Charlotte to choose from at this price point."
"3","I took my parents for restaurant week, as they just moved to the area. We waited 45 minutes for a table, even with a reservation. Our meals were good but our waiter was for some reason short and somewhat curt with us (my friend dining with us used the word \""snarky,\"" which is also fitting). It felt like he didn't really want to be there, and certainly not serving us. I wish we had gone to Capital Grille instead, I find they always treat you like royalty."
"5","OMG there's only a couple times in your life when everything just clicks. That was tonight.\n\nI got the price fix (a 42$ meal with 3 courses) with a ceased salad that had great dressing and flavor in every bite. Then I got the filet cooked medium rare (#amazing) wich words cannot explain. Then came our souffl\u00e9 wich is inastagram heaven. (#foodporn)"
"4","A great Starbucks in a great community. The staff is friendly, the music is amazing, and the energy there is just great. My only complaint? Finding parking is kind of a pain."
"2","Not sure what everyone raves about, service was terrible, and the crowd was thin.  I didn't eat, so I can't tell you about the food, I was going to eat, but based on how long it took to get a drink I went to Mac's to eat and you should too."
"3","Finally made it to Tyber Creek for the first time! After all, it's been 2.5 years since I moved to Southend, so what's the rush...ha! Good beer selection with decent bar food in a dark atmosphere with old TV's...enough said."
"2","Pre-renovation I was a huge fan on Tyber, and yes, due to it's proximity to my abode, it still gets more than one star, but taking out the games upstairs and replacing them with booths... not okay. \n\nThe food has always been decent (especially for midnight fare), the bartenders have always been great, but walking upstairs was a disaster. I never noticed a seating problem before, but apparently the owners did... oddly enough, the high tables were still busy as usual, but all of the booths sat empty. Only once the upstairs bathroom line grew too long did people start to occupy the nearest cushion. Also, instead of people being able to gravitate to a high top away from the stairwell like they used to, they were stuck standing right near the stairs (or the bathroom) and walking from one side of the upstairs to the other was more hassle than needed be. \n\nTyber has definitely dropped on my list of near-home stop ins, but on an off night where I think it'll be slow enough I don't have to head upstairs for a seat, I'll probably be back."
"1","I want to like this place so bad because it is across the street and therefore the most convenience place to eat and drink for my entire building.  This place is horrible. The food is awful and the staff are all snotty.  I have tried to eat there so many times.  The grilled chicken tastes like rubber and is always burned, the bread is always stale and when you speak up to staff about it they give you an attitude like you are making it up.  The only thing positive at this place is their spinach dip.  I have seriously never had a worse experience with food, staff, or a Charlotte bar in total.  DO NOT GO HERE."
"3","Seems like your typical neighborhood bar with outdoor games (cornhole, darts, giant jenga) and friendly service.  I liked that you could have a dog outside and the atmosphere was very casual.  Pretty standard fare of drinks and food.  We ordered the dip/pita appetizer.  The pub cheese was cold (womp womp) and the hummus was bland but the server was incredibly nice in bringing us multiple rounds of pitas to dip!"
"4","Unfortunately I had to experience the ER today, but was very happy with the nurses, and doctors, and the rush/assessment for my visit. I was nervous and they were comforting and allowed me to leave satisfied, and with some medicine and instructions, with discharge paperwork.  Overall, great experience, but the wait time was so long."
"5","Anna's is fantastic, and pretty much can alter anything you bring in.\nI have brought multiple pants there (dressy and jeans) and have never had an issue with the final result.  I have also had a few dresses and skirts done as well.  On top of that I brought my wedding dress in to be fitted. I bought my dress as a sample so it needed multiple alterations, as well things I wanted changed (taking off some beading) and they also did the bustle- which was difficult on the dress I had.\nI couldn't have been happier with everything they did! Although with specific employees some of the things I was saying was 'lost in translation' but usually one of the younger girls was around to clarify what I was wanting.\nI will always bring my items to Anna's"
"4","I'm almost embarrassed to say that it took me 2+ years to finally stop in at South End Exchange and I live only a few blocks away! \n\nI popped in here for a few minutes to take a look at their antique treasures - expect furniture of all types and sizes, lovely mirrors, glassware, vintage dishes, paintings and a whole slew of kitschy antique-y fun to decorate a space. While I'm no expert in pricing antique or consigned furniture, the items looked reasonable for the condition and quality. I saw everything for a $5 (adorable) dish to a $1,600 sofa in a matter of minutes. I was especially diggin' some of the really lovely and large antique mirrors - priced between $100-$150. \n\nBe aware that this place is *packed* with goodies and the quarters can be quite tight. Thus, if you really are seeking a treasure, make sure you devote some serious time to your search. Since I've only been in here once, I'm not sure how often the merchandise changes out, but based on the goods I imagine there are new items consigned on a fairly regular basis! If I were decorating a cool country space or simply adding some flair to my own dwelling, South End Exchange is definitely worth a stop!"
"2","If you're in need of specialty sized shoes, I'd suggest going elsewhere.  Husband and I came here thinking it would be a good place to try and fit his Fred Flintstone sized feet (he wears quadruple E wide shoes, so yeah).  They didn't have the size stocked that we needed, but they said that they could order them, no problem.  They had us pre-pay for the shoes and shipping (which was fine at the time), but then, 2 weeks later they called us and told us they couldn't get the shoes we needed.  2 weeks!  And they couldn't refund us the money back to our card over the phone and didn't offer any alternatives, so I had to go back to the store for a refund - so we were sans shoes for 2 weeks, and then we had to go look all over again!  Not cool.  I'm sure for hardcore runners and people with regular sized feet, this place is the jam, but for the casual runner and large-footed people, it's a no-go."
"3","New to running, my uncle recommend that I find a store that specialized in running to have my feet fitted for the right running shoes.\n\nI believe the woman that helped me was named Erin, she was awesome.  She helped me determine where I was putting pressure when running, she talked me through the pros and cons of each shoe, and she explained some good beginner running habits I should start.  I am a little concerned about the pricing, as some of the shoes they have can be found at your local Rack Room for about $40 cheaper.  However, overall a good experience.  The time the salespeople spend with you is nice and beneficial.  Although I don't think that this is necessarily the place to begin your running experience, just based on prices."
"4","I'm a total out of shape, novice runner. That said, the couple of times I've been in run for your life, the guys have been exceedingly polite and helpful. A young fellow recommended unbelievably expensive socks, I thought he was full of it, but he was totally right! He recommended coming back to check my stride but was very understandable that shoes are expensive, no sales pressure. I really respect that. I plan to go here when it's time for a new pair of shoes."
"4","I'm having an affair with Dilworth coffee. My wife asks where I'm going...I usually say \""Dilworth Coffee\"". It's quiet, small and not too loud. Great background music going on, and oh yeah, the coffee is really tasty. Small little gifts; about 40 different coffee's to buy in the bean stage. A quiet afternoon, a coffee and my laptop or iPhone makes Dilworth coffee a 2nd home."
"3","Their decor and atmosphere is amazing. Their kalbi is amazing as well, cooked perfectly. Everything else, was just a bust. Their shrimp tempura roll left a lot to the imagination to be desired. Their calamari, just tasted so much better before hand. I think more people go for the environment rather than the quality of the food. However, there are better restaurants than this, I would definitely choose CUISINE MALAYA sushi anyday. They seem to have a lot more variety but  more importantly, their food just tastes better."
"4","Good vibe, good food. Too loud on weekend nights. Make a choice, nightclub or dinner."
"4","Excellent selection of well prepared Sushi.  Nice atmosphere that is definitely a bit \""Clubby\"" as somebody previously mentioned."
"4","Best sushi in Charlotte, hands down.  If you've never been to Nikko, prepare yourself to pay accordingly.  Let's face it:  Pappy Van Winkle costs a hell of a lot more than Jim Beam but it tastes a hell of a lot better, too.  And so it goes with Nikko.  You can save money by eating at Sushi 101 but you won't experience the superior quality fish and preparation.  \n\nI'll admit it...it can be a bit of a surprise when the music suddenly becomes louder and Joanna comes out with her tambourine.  You know it's coming, you just don't know when.  Batten down the hatches and prepare yourself for it ahead of time.  Winning a saki bomb throwdown is not one of my finest restaurant moments, but I can mark it off the bucket list.  You should, too.  The atmosphere is extremely clubby and most of the patrons are, well, clubtastic.  \n\nSo, now that you're prepared for the price, the dancing, the tambourine, the cowboy hat and the clientele, you need to prepare your mouth for the most delicious sashimi in town.  The uni is wonderful salty deliciousness.  The blue fin toro will melt in your mouth like butter.  And so on and so forth.  I only wish that I could get a bowl full of fried shrimp heads without having to order the sweet shrimp.  I just can't stomach those snotty little bastards.  Joanna!  Save up your shrimp heads for me so I can have a delicious bowl of them every time I visit!  Please!"
"5","The best!"
"5","Thank you, Nikko, for the best sushi we've had in a while! \n\nWe felt special from the superb valet parking service to...well...the superb valet parking service when we left!\n\nWe sat at the sushi bar and enjoyed a lovely sampler platter last Saturday, including sashimi, nigiri sushi and a tasty slightly spicy tuna roll.  For a couple of hungry people, the Sushi/Sashimi Omakase is a great value at about $36.  We also shared Age Dashi Tofu with Shrimp, served piping hot with an amazingly rich (almost beefy) dashi broth.  House sake is good.\n\nThis place has incredible atmosphere, and is a great 'night out on the town' place to go.  Decor is gorgeous and modern.  We were dressed pretty casual, but didn't feel under-dressed.  The sushi bar is fun and lively - and the prep line is impeccably clean and orderly.  Fish is fresh-fresh-fresh.  The chefs are well-trained and conscientious.  Bravo to the ownership and management.\n\nFriday and Saturday nights, if you are in the restaurant around 7:30 or 8, you will feel a transformation as the lighting changes and the DJ starts mixing.  It gets LOUD.  But it's fun.  Nikko has great energy!  This is one of Charlotte's best."
"2","The employees were very nice and paid good attention to our table.  I do have to say that i didnt like the food.  I eat sushi at least twice a week and have an idea of what its supposed to taste/look like.\n\nI ordered the tuna nachos and I didn't like them."
"1","This gallery has an explicit policy on their website that they will not entertain the art of any local artist.  I hope that the public will avoid them and instead go to galleries that allow Charlotte artists an opportunity to exhibit their work."
"1","The worst collection of art suited for those who know very little about art. This gallery is neither progressive, provocative, or intellectually stimulating. It is perfect for Charlotte."
"3","I tried this place after seeing it in the loafer so many times with rave reviews. I enjoyed my burger and fries although my guest didn't so much. I will note that they DO NOT have air conditioning. I was melting..."
"1","OMG! how is this place still in business? It must be a front for some sort of money laundering scam or something...not going to waste too much time here...been there twice..both times...cramped, rude, horrible service, and last but not least FOOD POISONING! enough said.."
"3","I am not sure why, but the main thing sticking out in my head from my recent visit to the Kabob Grill is the window tint.  I do not believe it was there last time I patronized the restuarant a few years ago.  They may have had wooden blinds.  Either way, from the exterior, you can get no idea of what is to happen on the inside.\nNo idea whatsoever that it houses some of the best Middle Eastern food in Charlotte.\nI went with the grilled lamb kabobs with sides of basmati rice and hummus and I was more than satisfied with my selection.  The lamb was done just right and the portions were ample enough to satisfy my hunger.  \nMaybe its the window tint, but the service is never exactly sunny in there.  Nevertheless, you get the Middle Eastern family feel to the establishment and it makes for a wonderful dining experience."
"4","My girlfriend and I recently visited Kabob Grill while vacationing in Charlotte for the weekend. We ordered a falafel wrap with a piece of baklava to-go for lunch. Both items were good, but the prices seemed very high for dinner and still pricey for lunch. I've definitely had better falafel wraps for less money in larger cities, but Kabob Grill does offer more options than just falafel. There's something counter-intuitive to me about restaurants with high prices located in strip malls, but at least I haven't been disappointed by the food. \n\nI can't speak for the rest of their menu, but I would recommend Kabob Grill for anyone interested in falafel wraps at lunch time. The parking situation seemed a little scarce considering we went on a Sunday, but there is more parking available at other locations along the street."
"2","I tend to judge a Mediterranean restaurant by their shawarma and falafel, since these are pretty standard and easy to make right (or hard to mess up, if you prefer that phrase). I've been to this place three times, all three times I haven't been impressed. Their shawarma doesn't have a very good flavor, and the falafel sandwich is too dry. I understand that falafel is dry in nature, but it shouldn't be this dry. Btw, the shawarma is dry too, but it seemed better after the falafel. The gyro wrap was alright, but still nothing great.\n\nI would consider driving to La Shish Kabob or even Zeitoni all the way in Ballantyne before I go to this place again."
"2","My best friend bought her gorgeous wedding dress here. I wasn't able to be there the weekend she went dress shopping so when I came in town this weekend for her birthday she wanted to take me there so she could try it on for me. It was a Saturday and we weren't sure id they'd be busy so we called to see if they could go ahead and pull it so it would be ready for her to try on once we arrived. After calling three times, someone finally answered the phone and said sure that'd be no problem.\n\nOnce we got there no one greeted us, so we walked to the desk where two people were sitting doing absolutely nothing (one was eating). Even then neither said a word! So I spoke to tell them w had called etc and while I was explaining another employee walked by and heard me talking and asked if we called, I said yes, and she said yeh we have the dress back here, pulled, waiting for you. Great! So she takes my friend back and I sit in a chair to wait to see her in her gown. Well the lady leaves, so I have to go back and help her zip her dress, uhhh, that was a little crazy to me. I zip it, go back to the chair so I can see her walk out. She looked gorgeous in it. I asked her about veils and had she tried any on and she said no, so again I tracked someone down to help us with veils. She brings us two and then leaves.\n\nThey also sale bridesmaid dresses so we went to look at those bc shes back and forth about the color scheme she wants. No one comes to offer help with that either. Theres ANOTHER employee over there literally just straightening out the dresses, does she ask if we need any help? NO! We grabbed a couple just to see the color next to the brides dress, struggling to take pictures while holding dresses up, any help? Nope.\n\nMy gf told me they've had bad customer service throughout her entire process. She said every time they say they're going to call when somethings done, they dont. She leaves messages bc they never answer their phone and they dont call her back. And I got to see first hand how horrible it was. She, nor any of her bridesmaids will be giving them another penny. Horrible customer service. This is a BRIDAL boutique, soon to be brides should be doted on and made to feel special, not ignored."
"2","The food here is great - my problem with the place is around two things:  ok although a minor problem it still is a consistent problem...every time I go I get a milkshake and every time it is not mixed well enough.  This results in huge chunks of ice cream you have to mash or wait for it to melt.  I dont like that.  The second problem I have with this place is the service.  I have gone four times at varying times of the day and always the service is subpar.  I end of flagging down the waiter for refills and begging for the check again and again.  But the food is good so if you are only interested in the food and the cute atmosphere then this is your place...not for me though."
"2","Went for Sunday brunch. Ordered a Western Omelet - it was ok. Others at my table got the all-you-can-eat buffet, and seemed to enjoy it - I think this is a quantity over quality kind of place.\nOne highlight was the hashbrown casserole - very tasty!"
"4","I'm a fan based on two things:  The price for breakfast and the variety of baked goods offered!\n\nIf I read the menu correctly, you have to get there before 10am to get the breakfast price of $8.95 versus the \""brunch\"" price of $13.95.  The buffet was perfect and offered everything I could have wanted so I suggest sticking with the breakfast buffet.\n\nBuffets can go one way or the other.  Either they are disgusting (ie Golden Corrall) with a ton of plastic, boxed food or they are a display of heavenly goodness.  Fortunately for me, Pike's offered the latter!   We're talking fresh fruit salad, biscuits and gravy, grits, cheese/potatoe hash, muffins, scones and pastries, eggs, egg benedict, sausage, bacon, blueberry french toast, etc.  Everything was fresh, what needed to be crispy was crispy, what needed to be fluffy was fluffy, what needed to be moist was moist.  It was all very good and of course the best part is that it is limitless!\n\nThe servers were friendly and by around 10:30 it was starting to get packed.  Obviously the south-end location is key and there really shouldn't be any other reason not to give them a try!\n\nI'll be back!"
"3","I actually went here twice this past weekend while my parents were in town. We first popped in for dinner and then again for the breakfast buffet. It's worth mentioning that there is actually a breakfast and a brunch buffet with varied times, a bit of a varied menu and a few dollars more for brunch.\n\nIn order of how much I appreciated each, I would say the wait-staff deserves the gold, the atmosphere and decor the silver and the food gets the bronze. Now, the same way I wouldn't complain about a bronze medal I really can't complain about the food. However, I truly can't rave about it. So much so that I needed to knock two stars off.\n\nWhat Pike's has effectively proven to be for me is a close-by place to grab a good meal at a good price without much hassle. Nothing stands out and I'm never craving it but a good stand-by none-the-less.\n\nDisclaimer: This can very well be grounds for an updated review in the coming weeks but the most I've experienced in way of desserts here is a SIP of a milkshake. The cakes on display look great and a slice of one with a milkshake on the side could nudge me to add a 4th star."
"4","Just had Sunday brunch here with my young family. Great soda shop atmosphere. Excellent cheesy potatoes and broccoli casserole. Frankly, everything we tried was delicious. Kids got ice cream with their meals and I topped mine off with a perfectly tart key lime pie. Trinette was our waitress and her service was outstanding and exemplified southern charm.  This has been on my Ohio-headed-south hit list for a few years and I'm so glad we stopped. Very reasonably priced.  A little windy today or we would've sat on the patio and watched the trains go by.  Will come back."
"3","Stopped in today for a milkshake on a recommendation of a co-worker.  I opted for the peanut butter milkshake.. since I really like peanut butter and had a hankering for it, but besides that.. It is National Peanut Butter Month, so great choice any way that I looked at it.  The milk shake was good, just wished there was more of it for the price (it came to $5.28 with tax).  I sat at the soda counter which was cool and my server was Kyle who was nice enough.  I signed up for their rewards program, got points for my milkshake purchase and also earned a first-timer award good for a free dessert or appetizer on my next visit!! SCORE!!\n\nOn my next trip, hopefully I'll have more time to enjoy some of their food and of course enjoy my free app or dessert!"
"2","Its been a while since I've been here but the last time I was there the beer was not cold at all and the staff just didn't seem that interested in making sure you had a great experience. I love the location but not sure when I'd go back."
"3","Great little bar to grab a bite before getting your drink on at the Gin Mill.  I love the quaint atmosphere and seriously good bar bites. We had less than stellar service on our last visit, but you know, that's not what brings me into a place like this in the first place."
"5","Their sweet tea is the best in Charlotte, they use Royal Cup and you can taste the difference.  \n\nThe pancakes are definitely their high point.  they are the perfect combination of golden, soft and spongey.  Their omelettes are massive and fully of cheesy yummy goodness.  I ordered an egg and bacon plate and there was more crispy bacon than eggs (which is never a bad thing!)\n\nMake absolute sure you get there early or else there is a huge line, before 9 is better."
"4","Ok my personal breakfast choices in Charlotte are either here, Denny's, or IHOP. This place is always packed on Saturdays and the food and service is great. There are plenty of items on the menu for people to choose from which is great. The omlettes are HUGE! And this is not an understatement either. Two or three people can probably share it and it would be enough. \n\nIf you want to try a great b-fast place other than IHOP or Denny's...come here and you will not be disappointed"
"5","We got there around 10 am on Sunday.   We were seated right away and got a booth.  Our waitress was most delightful.  Her name was Jessica--super sweet and attentive. \n\nFood came out right away.  We got apple pancake and a crape. Portions were large. \n\nWhen we were leaving, the place was quite crowded and there was a wait."
"2","It had been a couple of years since we visited, and the service (and cleanliness) seems to have gone downhill. \n\nWe got there around 8:00 a.m. on a Sunday, and it wasn't crowded at all... however, it took so long for our waiter to come by that we were about to get up and leave. He finally showed up, and I ordered the banana walnut pancakes with bacon while the fella ordered sausage and eggs over-well.\n\nTo be fair, it IS called the Original Pancake House, so sausage and eggs probably aren't the way to go, but the fella got the driest-looking hockey puck sausages I've ever seen. His plate was just sad. My pancakes were good, but they just had a few slices of bananas and walnuts on top - it seemed odd considering most banana pancakes I've had had the bananas already in the batter. The bacon was solid.\n\nAs we left, the place was pretty packed, so maybe the service gets better as they get busier? I won't be in a hurry to go back."
"4","I was in the mood for breakfast and stopped in.\nI was not disappointed.\nI was seated immediately and was able to promptly place my order.\nEverything came out hot and tasty."
"3","One of the stops on the Light Rail Bar Crawl, I felt that the Gin Mill was the most \""dive-y\"" with a lot of dented chrome and scarred wood a bathroom that needed a flamethrower and some seriously loud music. I sat at the bar with my beer and watched the young-uns dancing to the DJ's tunes on the \""stage\"". This vantage point gave me a great opportunity to see the bartenders in operation. Fast, efficient and friendly. Picking up abandoned empties and serving out drinks quickly. Impressive.\n\nBouncer at the door checking ID's. Taxi stand outside ready to take the wobbly folks home, but I was good. It's a very short walk to the Light Rail station that gave me time to sober up (I only had four drinks over five hours) while riding back to my parked car."
"4","I was here the other night for Thirsty Thursday.  You can't beat a cold 14oz beer for $1 and their hot dogs are pretty good too!\n\nWe had great seats right down on the field.  It's been a couple of years since I've been to a game here and I have to say the field looked great but the complex itself needs a little TLC.  Just about everything there that's metal needs to be painted.  \n\nAlready looking forward to my next visit..."
"1","I have tried many times to take my boys here. Today the 21st of August I tried again. It says that the hours are 1pm til 5 pm. This museum is never open!! Can anyone tell me why? My boys are officially done with trying to visit. The last time we were able to go in was 2 years ago when Santa was there. I called and I was sent to a mail box. Great way to make people want to come visit."
"3","I had the Gyro salad in a shell. The salad itself was great. Wasn't a fan of the shell. I would come back for the salad and to try the fish. My friends swear by the place which i dont get but I am willing to try again. My friend had the chicken pita with onion rings. She wasnt a fan of either. The onion rings are pretty bland (or maybe Ive just had much better onion rings)."
"5","The best lunch spot in Charlotte. Friendly, family atmosphere. Great food, exceptional service!"
"2","If you think Brixx is good pizza then you have never had good pizza. The crust is bland and some how manages to be dense and chewy despite being thin. One question has bugged each time I have gone to any a Brixx location; how are they allowed to call themselves \""wood-fired\"" when THERE IS NO WOOD in the place?? Even for the pizza waste land that is Charlotte, Brixx is disappointing.\n\nThe one saving grace may be the drink menu. There is a variety of beer and an om wine list. Specials are not great but prices on the list are reasonable."
"3","The pizza is consistently ok, the beer plentiful, service generally friendly, and they allow dogs on the patio rain or shine. We like the BBQ chicken pizza and the pesto. The quattro formagio and the mushroom pizzas are both fine though a bit bland. I love that pizzas is fairly thin, but would prefer that is have a bit more flavor and less raw flour or cornmeal stuck to the crust. \n\nThe Brixx salad is a winner for lunch if you aren't in the mood for pizza. Also, pizza is BOGO after 10 during the week and 11 on weekends.\n\nThis Brixx is incredibly convenient for those of us living in Dilworth condos. For that reason alone, we are regulars."
"3","As Demetria said, this place is definitely hit and miss. If you want some good eats, get here early. They tend to run out of the real goodies.\n\nFried-chicken, when it isn't too overcooked/dried out, is a home run. I just wish they would perfect cooking it. I swear it alternates every other visit having it cooked perfectly.  Their six-cheese spaghetti is pretty good but can suffer the same fate at the chicken. Sides are plentiful to choose from. Mac-n-Cheese..same case as above. It's a home run if it hasn't been too burnt on top. Love their blackeyed peas and cornbread too. They might just have the best lemonade in Charlotte and I'm too scared to ask if it's just a brand-name mix. I really don't want to know. If you can bypass one of the volunteer's who fills up the drinks, you can make yourself a pretty slammin' Arnold Palmer.\n\nSpeaking of the volunteers, they're always extremely friendly and will even give you an extra dollop of mac-n-cheese if you know how to charm 'em like I do. Be sure to tip at the register.\n\nYour pal,\nWalter"
"3","It's not that I hate Just Fresh, it's that I'm not head over heels in love with it. However, if I do go to a Just Fresh, it's definitely this location. I prefer to go for dinner since there is rarely anyone else in there. It's creepy yet comforting at the same time for somewhere in Dilworth to be dead. They're open to 8pm on the weeknights though so that could be the reason? They have a great selection of \""just fresh\"" sandwiches, soups, salads, etc. Their mozzabella salad is one of my favorites out there and they have a good selection of vegetarian friendly items. Plus they offer a punch card for sandwiches and salads so when you get ten, you get a free one, who doesn't love that??\n\nFree wifi too and quick!"
"1","Worse McDonald's I have ever been to. I live close so I eat here whenever Its late or early. No matter what time you come whether late or early they are always slow. I stand in line for 5 to 10 min just to get my order taken when there's not even a line. You will be standing there waiting while theres groups of employees talking...gossipping....cussing. The drive thru is just as slow except you better expect to go in to get what they forgot to put in bag....whether that be food...creamers and sugars for coffee...I recommend HOLDING UP THE LINE TO MAKE SURE THEY GOT IT RIGHT and maybe eventually these clowns will learn to get it right. Customer service is also horrible ..the kids that work there are feisty young black females who could care less to be there let alone deal with you. Out of all the times I've been there being a regular there maybe once have they said thank you when they hand me my food despite the fact I say it each time I get my food. I was raised with manners though, i recommend bojangles across the street."
"3","Attended a gun show here. Nice facility.  Lots of parking and easy to get in and out of."
"1","DO NOT USE HEARTH AND PATIO!!!! CHIMNEY FIRE NEW YEARS EVE. I have had my logs for less than two years. 1) purchase, glad to take my money 2) installation, two weeks late,and according to responders, improper flue installation, TWO times, causing heat to go up chimney (they didn't even use fire proof sealer) causing fire. When installer was ask about cleaning chimney, he said not necessary. Had them out to inspect for smell, then said i needed it cleaned, and more money. I HAVE NEVER BEEN SO UNSATISFIED just trying to enjoy a fire."
"2","Okay, I'm from San Diego. I love everything Mexican and Fish Tacos are a must. Unfortunately, I've found this place to be more trendy than good. When I received my fish tacos they looked like what I expected except for one thing. If the fish was breaded at the restaurant then why bother breading fish pieces. The fish itself was fine but I received pieces. Typically, if you cut the fish correctly you won't have pieces. The batter was okay but I've fish sticks for Gorton's that were better. The batter had absolutely no flavor. It just seemed that someone took the time to decorate but I felt that I was served leftovers. I'm going to look somewhere else for fish tacos in the future.\n\nIf you ever in San Diego then try Rubio's, which is a fast food fish taco place and they seem to know what to serve the customer and what not to serve the customer. Cabo's didn't feel that way. At I could have received the same dinner for half the price but with a lot more flavor."
"1","This place is awful.  I had heard good things about it before going, and thought from the name that it would be really fresh and authentic.  I couldn't be more wrong.  You get chips and salsa to start - but its not even salsa.  Its a bowl that looks like they threw a handful of canned corn in the bottom, chopped some tomatoes and onions on top and then added in some picked cactus.  It was vinegary and just bad.  I asked if they had some other salsa, and they brought me a ketchup flavored bowl of yuck.... On to the main course... I ordered the beer battered shrimp tacos, thinking the seafood tacos would be their star dish.  The tortillas were fried, the shrimp had no flavor, and it just tasted greasy and bland.  This place probably stays in business because it is one of the onyl restaurants on the block.  Save yourself the money!"
"3","Cabo is a very busy place- even on a Tuesday night! Luckily we were a party of 2 and were seated pretty quick. The food tasted good and fresh, but I had very high expectations based on the reputation they have in Charlotte. I was hoping for a little more flavor.\n\nContrary to some of the other reviews, I didn't feel rushed even though they were jammin'. I went with a friend and we were catching up for quite a while, but our waitress was friendly and didn't rush us, which I appreciated. Parking can be difficult, like most places in NoDa, so plan to cruise around a little. \n\nOverall I think Cabo has a fun atmosphere for grabbing drinks and something to eat, but it isn't a \""go out of your way\"" establishment."
"5","Their fish tacos are the best in Charlotte! SO DELICIOUS! And they always have a great draught selection. I LOVE CABO!"
"3","Having for some reason been here twice now, I've come to the conclusion that Cabo makes it's fried seafood tacos well and everything else is decidedly meh. I've tried two of their specials, which though well seasoned, were just hopelessly overcooked.\n\nStill my fried shrimp tacos were solid and the tecate tall boys are like 3 bucks so it's not too bad."
"2","Great food but service was lacking.  I went with a group of friends months ago.  I asked for my food not spicy at all and a friend asked for it very spicy.  When it came out, they had got it mixed up.  Mine was extremely spicy and his was not spicy at all. No big deal, just send it back and have it remade.  It came out the second time, and same thing, the food was the same.  Mine was still extremely spicy and his had no spiciness at all.  We complained to the waitress again.  My friend and I decided to switch food so I had his and he had mine.  The bill came and they charged us for both.  \n\nWhile the food was amazing, the service was lacking."
"3","Went with two of my girlfriends on a Wed. Night. Seated immediately. Restaurant had a nice feel to it.\n\nI ordered a traditional beer battered fish taco and a Wahoo Fish taco. The latter was simply amazing. The traditional (at least what I consider traditional) was just okay. Perhaps I had super high expectations because, oh I don't know, their name includes the words \""Fish Taco\"". The corn salsa was fresh and very tasty. The guacamole was just okay but my expectations weren't that of the beer battered fish tacos seeing as how it's not \""Cabo Guacamole Dip\"".\n\nThis was my first visit so I asked our \""too cool for school\"" waiter his recommendation. He smugly responded, \""I haven't had a bad taco in 4 years.\"" Dude, I didn't ask how long you've been employed at the establishment, I asked what you recommended from the establishment. \n\nAll in all, food was good, nice environment, waiter was a douche."
"2","I really want to love this place but I really think it's overrated. I've been a number of times over the years and the food is rarely better than ok. The service has always been awesome though."
"5","I ate at CFT for the first time this week with some coworkers. Delish!! I had the chicken quesadilla, and asked for light cheese...it was perfect. Looking forward to going back soon!!"
"2","Sadly, we had a really bad experience. Our guacamole had a really strange texture and unpleasant taste and the tacos were hardly even mediocre. The fish tacos had no cabbage, cilantro, or lime, they were pretty lacking in general and were served with wilted green leaf lettuce. The black beans and rice had no flavor. The party at the table next to us had to send their meal back for being uncooked. It was just not a meal I would ever come back for."
"3","Great location, good service. Just an okay food experience. Chips were cold and salsa had more corn in it then a sauce dip for chips and salsa. I ordered the shrimp tacos they were pretty good."
"5","YES YES!  Do wish they brought back the jalapeno mashed potatoes! But every time they rock my world with the goto FISH TACO!!!!!"
"5","Great service great atmosphere and good food!!!! The mahi tacos and jalape\u00f1o mashed potatoes are good. Will come back and try the tempura tuna tacos"
"2","I have been into Dynasty for a pedicure before and it was a nice experience. Nothing that blew me away, but nice none-the-less. Unfortunately, I made the decision to stop there to get my nails done yesterday and my fingers are still regretting that choice. The nail tech that I had was rough, made me bleed twice without any compassion and just gave me an overall negative feeling. I seemed to be an inconvenience for him. The work was sloppy and not what I am used to. Now, I know getting nails can cause your fingers to be sore, but I've never had my nail beds hurt like they do today. I learned my lesson not to go here again for a nail set. Just wanted you to know my experience."
"2","Guy who did my nails was rude and I got a gel manicure that went into my cuticles and onto the skin on several nails. Very messy. Maybe I had a bad manicurist, but I felt the staff was rude to most people who walked in the door. Won't be back."
"3","I would give them four stars but the nail tech was horrible! The pedicures are amazing. One of the best I've had for only $25. Includes exfoliating scrub and relaxing massage. The only downfall was my nails. The nail tech Janine did such a rush job on my nails. When I mentioned little things I noticed that weren't done incorrectly she gave me excuses and continued on and never really fixed it. I don't usually sweat over little things but these were too obvious!  This is the best place to come for a pedicure but the nails should be done elsewhere.!!"
"1","Halloween is my all time favorite holiday so I tend to go over-board and spend more money than I should.  Every year I have a halloween party.  I am a really good customer at Morris Costumes in this location: 4300 Monroe Rd. Charlotte, however during  my last visit I was very taken aback by the woman (older woman) that owns the store.  You have to ask to try on the wigs behind the counter, so I did and then I proceeded to put the wig on and look at it in the mirror by the dressing room. The owner came over and said to the young girl manning the booth \""Watch her\"" as I was trying on the wig in a tone as if I was going to walk off with it!!!!  First of all I am a grown woman who is a faithful shopper, probably one of their best, I have 2 kids and I am a business owner myself why on earth would she ever get the impression I was going to steal her wig is beyond me!  I would never do that and didn't give her any reason what so ever to think I would!  She said it loud and embarrassed me and made me feel like a criminal.  I said, \""don't worry I am not going to steal your wig\"" and that made her get even more of an attitude and she said \""I don't want someone like you shopping here, leave\""  OMG never in my life has something so surreal like this ever happen to me. The woman sorry to say is delusional.  Not a good vibe with friendly customer service in there, they just eagle eye you thinking the worst which is unfortunate because they had some good items but it makes you not want to give your money to such a crazy person. Although the store is big it's not the \""IT\"" store to go to for costumes, she should be careful because now a days there is a lot of competition out there with Halloween stores opening, so why be treated like that and why support her and give her your hard earned money when you can go somewhere else?  On-line, party city, halloween stores that just open space for the holiday to just name a few!  Get treated with respect when you shop!  I felt very violated."
"4","Awesome bakery but mostly I come for the Hawaiian Macadamia Nut coffee.  They are famous for their cranberry toast which I have to admit that I have never tried.  But other breads and delicious desserts keep me coming back. Nova supplies a lot of coffee shops uptown and I am delighted to support local.  Their campy sitting areas (in and outside) make me feel so mellow and relaxed - it is a great place for a book and a cup-o-joe!"
"4","Nova's is great  if you get their fresh bread.  I particularly like their Focaccia\nand their savory scones.\n\nAs far as sweet treats, I love their gingerbread cookies around the holidays."
"1","Customer service is left to be desired to top a less than average bakery. We have now been there a few times, always wanting to give them another chance, but after they decline to honor a coupon that allegedly expired 11 hrs prior (rather than 13 hrs later, who puts a time on their coupons BTW) and offered no apology of any kind, we definitely just won't be back, not worth it."
"1","Meh. No macaroons. Cold standoffish worker seemed mad about something. Rolled his eyes multiple times and got angrier the more questions we asked him, even after we apologized explaining it was our first time here. It didn't really make sense, but the food, coffee, or hot chocolate wasn't worth going back to possibly receive an attitude with. Just stopped in on our way to Sadu, won't be returning. \n\nWe ordered a lemon bar, a chocolate chip muffin, a small hot coco, and a medium decaf mocha coffee. Which came up to about $10.18 not really worth it.  I really wanted to like this place because it's on my way to school too. Darn."
"4","Hands down the best breakfast in Charlotte, with an entertaining floor show to boot if Jimmy is fussing at his mother (or vice versa). On a good day, I'll start off with a John Biscuit - basically a ham, egg and cheese biscuit....that's an appetizer according to Jimmy (owner and John's son). Their grits are perfect so I rarely get hashbrowns (which are diced/fried potatoes vs. waffle house style). Smoked sausage is great - not your typical generic sausage - order the \""big links\"". The other trick that I learned is to order \""grilled toast\"". One of the No Grease barbers ordered it once, and I was sold...he butters up the bread and grills it on the flat top....ridiculously good. My only complaints are  the average to below-average coffee and the tiny napkins (also no equal...boo). Wait staff has typical diner efficiency. Get their early for breakfast on the weekends!!!! How people can pay double digits at Zada Jane's when this gem is across the street is beyond me."
"5","Awesome beer selection, ok latkes, and surprisingly great coffee. When I wake up a little early, this is my first stop on the way to work."
"4","Always has a good selection of local beers on tap. There deli makes delicious sandwiches fresh and fast. They also have a wide variety of craft beer on sale. They make there own brand of coffee sold by the counter and also carry Zapps chips from Louisiana which are the best brand of kettle chips known to man"
"4","I think i just got 10x cooler and more hipster jut walking in the door! This is a really cool funky little place that has everything from beer and wine, to toys, candy, and quirky gifts. You can hang out there in some small seating areas, and even order food. Worth it just to come in and look around even if you dont need anything!"
"2","I'm not really going to be able to say much different than what everyone else has said.  There are some very clear negatives about the Ovens Auditorium.\n\n- The Lobby is too small and not very inviting.  It could definitely use a facelift.\n- I'm tall but even my shorter friends found the seats to be especially uncomfortable even more so for a rather long musical.\n-The staff did not go out of their way to assist us.  They glanced at our tickets and pointed in a general direction as to where we could find our seats.\n-I thought the sound was pretty poor but it could have been my seat location.\n-Nothing nearby for pre or post theater drinks, dinner, or dessert.\n\nAll in all I was pretty disappointed.  I paid big theater price for my event but got the Ovens instead."
"3","Agree big time with almost everyone.  I am pretty sure this place played movies with a piano in the 20's and only decided to update the front entrance.  I went here to see Tosh and it was actually perfect for that.  I don't mind seeing a comedy show in a venue like this, but to see a band I would probably pass. I dont think the audio can manage, and I hate being at a concert where I have to sit the whole time.  Sure I have seen great shows in NYC, but we usually all flooded the aisles.  I rather hit up somewhere like Amos's for a band, but this place is ok for comedy shows.  The only other good thing this place has is cheap drinks!"
"5","My 6 yr old was ready for her very first piercing!  I was looking for something professional, not the usual mall piercing places.  Because it was for my little girl, safety and sanitation was priority and that I got at Sadu plus much more.\nI called and spoke with Cindy. She was very sweet over the phone and went over the requirements with minors. I ended up calling two more times (to make the apt and then find out parking info) and spoke with a guy named Mike who was equally courteous.  Upon arriving I was greeted and Cindy soon came to help us. She asked my daughter some questions to make sure she was ready and we went on with the process of choosing the earrings, etc.  \nI am beyond satisfied with our experience. Cindy explained all that was to happen as she unwrapped the tools. Oh, big plus here, the cleanliness of Sadu was impeccable. Everything was sterilized and neatly stored.  The room was clean and gloves were changed more than once during our visit to ensure cleanliness. \nUnfortunately, my daughter chickened out after the first lobe piercing and Cindy couldn't have been any more patient and wonderful. She went far and beyond to make her experience less frightening. Even told stories, gave my girl a Popsicle, the works!  She was just an amazing person.  Thankfully, (and after 2 hours) my daughter calmed down enough where Cindy felt comfortable piercing the second lobe.  I was so embarrassed by the delay my daughter cause and honestly I wanted to slap her for backing down after begging for pierced ears and promising she was ready.  \nOverall, the customer service I received exceeded my expectations!  This review is not typical but it goes to show the quality of the business in handling different clients, even children, with respect and patience.  I would give 10 stars if I could. \nOh and my girl's ears look so cute and she loves them!  She can't stop talking about how happy she is to have earrings. :)"
"4","I don't go to Dish for the culinary experience.  I do love the laid-back vibe with some good southern hangover/late night grub.  I like to order a half grilled cheese sandwish with a cup of tomato bisque.  I love that you get a deviled egg as a side to many dishes.  Nice touch.  My favorite is the black bean and rice burrito.  Cool tunes in the juke box.  Just a good local spot w/o the frills."
"4","100% southern comfort food at a great price.  You can't beat it!"
"3","Friends always push me to go to the Dish. I always ask myself, why are you so fond of their \""Southern homestyle cooking?\"" It's a part of that whole Central Ave corridor of restaurants like Penguin and The Diamond. We'll call it great just because of their location. Absolutely not. \n\nEvery time I walk into the place, I laugh. I literally laugh out loud because of how tacky it feels. I know you're on Central Ave and want to get that artsy and we've character unlike everyone else. Please, there isn't a hint of character in the place. You're probably saying, who cares it's an unpretentious place, it's the food you go for and the price. Keep telling yourself that.\n\nThe servers on the other hand are great. I have no complaints with them. They helped us as soon as we started looking at the menu and we received our drinks in a timely manner. The place was probably three-quarters filled and on a holiday. The menu is fairly standard and has your staple southern dishes hinted throughout the appetizers to the entrees. Nothing special. And I almost feel that for the location, the price for the appetizers would be a little more reasonable. What do I know though? \n\nWe all ordered our food and I decided to go for something different this time. I got the Chicken & Dumplings the last time I was here, so I went for the meatloaf hoping for something more enticing than flour and cream of chicken. That's what the C&Ds taste like if you were wondering. Bland and tasteless. Apparently a lot of people like them, but if I had the choice I'd take the Swanson C&Ds. THAT good, my friends. \n\nBack to my meatloaf. This is how it was prepared; mash a bunch of ground beef, add no seasoning, cook in oven, dip and cover in tomato sauce, plop it on a scoop of mashed potatoes, and add a dash of cilantro on top. The meatloaf wasn't at all what I had expected. I was expecting more flavor for them to actually call it Cajun. There was no cajun seasoning, onion, celery, garlic, or cayenne peppers. I'm not even sure if I tasted the essential Worcestershire sauce. Mashed potatoes were decent I'll admit. Potato salad, eh. Deviled egg, eh too. Biscuit I enjoyed, but maybe because my mind hoped it could enjoy something from the meal. I didn't enjoy the price that went along with the food either. \n\nI know this place is locally owned and operated and is a part of Charlotte history and culture. It just feels that they are taking advantage of that and laugh quietly to themselves for each hungry customer that comes in. I honestly expect better because of that history. They are there for a reason, but not for their food lately. Customers need to wake up and realize that the Dish has greater potential."
"3","Really good food! Service is not great, though. The kitchen is typically slow and it takes a while to get your food. I won't make a special trip to eat here, but if I'm in the neighborhood, it's a good place to eat."
"2","With all the hype, I expected better. The fried green tomato appetizer had a lot of potential, but the tomatoes were overripe and mushy. The batter was good and the horseradish dill sauce was fantastic, but nothing could make the mushy tomato great. \n\nSoup of the day was mashed cauliflower, and while it was not refined, it was pretty good. It at least had some cheesy flavor. \n\nThe veggie burger made of chickpeas was also limp and mushy with no flavor in itself. The southwestern toppings (guacamole, salsa, jalape\u00f1os, pepper jack) made it edible, but nothing special. \n\nMashed cauliflower was bland and tasteless and gritty, not creamy at all. Mac and cheese was as generic as possible. Couldn't tell if the green beans were canned or fresh, but they were also bland. Nothing great about the biscuit. \n\nGrilled eggplant pita was unusual but no strong spices or flavoring.\n\nOverall, pretty disappointing."
"5","We were in town for the weekend. We wanted to hit up a local \""Triple D\"" Dive, and we saw that The Dish had well written reviews. They weren't lying. The quality was excellent. It had a fresh and home made feel to every bite. Definitely coming back for dessert...one day."
"3","Order to go!  Definitely authentic and they don't speak much English.  But the service is friendly.  They even let me try the barbacoa when I asked what it tasted like while looking over the menu.  The flavors in their tacos really come through.  Chicken tacos are spicy all by themselves, and the guacamole is very simple, mostly avocado and lime juice.\n\nBut I will throw in a few dings for the table seating which consists of metal fold up chairs, booth seats that are all torn up, and there was even a rusty nail sticking out of the side of one of them.  But the booths are still the best way to go if you insist on dining in.  \n\nThe cuts of meat could be a lot better.  This is not going to become a regular place for me because I'm picky.  But I'll mark it down as an interesting experience and recommend it to anyone who wants to give them a go.  \""You should try it, but it's not for me...\"""
"4","I love the Neighborhood Theatre... it has kept me coming back for years.  From the Indigo Girls to DSO, the Brazilian Girls, North Mississippi Allstars, and Yo Mama's Big Fat Booty Band, to my most recent show-- the Blue Dogs and Drivin N Cryin, this is just a fantastic and friendly venue to see and hear a show.  \n\nIt gets loud and it can get crowded (very crowded) but it is usually a fun and friendly crowd.  On occasion you might want to get there early (bring a yard chair) if you want to grab a general admission seat (just put your name on the paper and pen you brought with you, and use the scotch tape you also remembered to bring) and reserve your seat... now head out to grab a bite while you wait for the show to start!  Seriously, it is that friendly... but, remember your seats won't allow for you to view the show, which is great for say, a husband who got dragged to see the IG.  \n\nThere are seats upstairs that are sometimes open, sometimes included in the GA price and sometimes reserved, just check the show listing.  There is also a VIP seating area that comes with a server.  I am fine to get my own PBR or-- the value cup!-- a big ole, in the case of this past weekend, Sierra Nevada.  Score!\n\nBathrooms surprisingly rarely have much of a wait... probably because you want to get in and out as fast as you can...but, they do have a Dyson hand dryer (the long one that you take your hands in and out of while hearing a sound similar to a jet engine!).  \n\nThis spot is a neighborhood staple and is an anchor to the area.  It is truly local business at its finest.  It also really helped ramp up the music scene in Charlotte..."
"3","Attended here for the yelp summer soire...when you first arrive the outside is a little dated but as you enter it is a huge space, large enough for private events, I really like the feel of the place and would love to come for a scheduled concert event...it is very dim in the place as well. Has a Nice size bar. Since everything was free didn't get a feel of there bar to be able to get an accurate review. Overall the place is very inviting and clean. Would love to plan an event here soon."
"5","We took our one year old dog, Owen, in for neutering.  The staff was wonderful!  The surgery went so well- very impressive.  I would highly recommend this vet- we have been in the area for over 25 years- tried many vets and this is the best without overcharging you."
"3","It's been a very long time since we have eaten at Lupie's.  It was good, but I ordered the chili that is too hot and too thick.  They have others I should have chosen.  My friend's chicken and dumplings were pretty thick, too large of an order, she had to get a to-go box.  I like Lupie's and the funky atmosphere, I would return and order differently."
"4","This is the coolest little coffee shop I've found, they always have cool art and they have a great menu and coffees, love it here."
"3","Am usually not a coffee person... but yest we had some time to while awa and tot vll check out this coffee shop...though the name doesn appeal at all, i must say for a change i enjoyed drinking coffee..ordered a cappuccino without any added flavor...it smelled good..and tasted nice!!\nalso picked up their house made muffins...a craneberry orange muffin..it was delicious...actually pieces of fruit to bite on...i loved it. the ambience is also nice for some one to just sit and read or listen to some music while enjoying a good cup of coffee."
"4","I went to this coffee shop simply bc its name caught my eyes. It's located in the Noda area (which parking can be such a chaos), but it has its own private parking lot  that's a huge plus. Also free wifi too!!!!\n\nThe shop has a very cozy fell to it, and has about 10 small tables inside and outside. It also has its own roasting machine, I guess that's a big plus for HUGE coffee fan. Personally I like my coffee sweet and strong like cuban coffee. However, I made the mistake of ordering a Hazelnut cold brew. I mean don't get me wrong I still like it, but I prefer some sugar to it.\n\nI came here to do a little research, since we haven't install internet at our place yet. After sitting there 3 hours, I decided to order a Chai iced latte and lemon poppy muffin. The latte is pretty good, but didn't stand out to me as a MUST have in my drink list.\n\nI will definitely go back for the extremely friendly staff, and to try the cuban coffee in a colder weather."
"4","Great coffee, fun atmosphere, and the staff were super friendly. We stopped here on our way to an event around the corner, and it was great. Their specialty is the dirty chai (chai tea w/1, 2, or 3 shots of espresso). We really liked it."
"1","Since my previous review about the new corporate version of this once loved establishment was flagged and removed i'll try again. It was removed  \""because it does not contain a new firsthand experience with the business.\"" Now why they think it wasn't based off of an experience is beyond me. (mind readers maybe??) \nAnyways, this is not the \""Original Penguin\"" that gained all the acclaim. Notice the \""TM\"" after the name now. \nIt is a lame, shell of a version of the restaurant that once lived. Wait staff was inattentive, food was greasy, I don't expect it to last long. \n\nIf you are looking for food inspired by the original Penguin, try Pinkys Westside, or The Diamond. Corporate entity's have no business swallowing up a local legend, and demanding the same respect of the community, please support local business."
"1","The \""new\"" Penguin Drive In leaves a lot to be desired. The server got our order wrong twice (on a slow Thursday night) and the food was cold and bland. No more crispy tater tots, greasy buns, or hot, juicy, and delicious burgers. A sad, sad, sad experience."
"3","I think the new Penguin is still pretty good, but it doesn't measure up to the old bird.  I ordered a burger and it was tasty, just not the same as the old Penguin.  They have cheap beer though and I really liked the fried mac n cheese.  The chili cheese fries weren't that great compared to the old ones I used to die for.  They use queso instead of cheddar cheese, hmmm....The staff is much nicer and accomodating which is cool with me, but it seems to have lost it's ambience."
"4","They ran out of their combo glassware and I was really looking forward to getting one with my chicken wrap combo!  Regardless, I appreciate the history behind this hole-in-the wall joint and even with the management change, I think the crowd of people waiting for a seat speak for itself.\n\nThe food was greasy and delicious, just as I remembered it from my previous visits years ago.  Kids running galore and a full house definitely brings a family vibe to the place. \n\nPenguin, you are one star away from perfection.  Clean up the place a little bit and give my my combo mug- then you'd be perfect."
"2","Horrible waited two hours for food with  a party of 5...while two tops were served first.  If I were staying in Charlotte longer I would have left as one table did and my brother told the server to take the food back.  I thought the food was delicious, everyone who ate enjoyed it, but the server had no clue, the cooks seriously had their heads up their asses.  The pulled pork was great, the potato salad with its strange goopy appearance was tangy and went well with the pork.  However, my brother will not be reccomending this diner to any out of town visitors; I might with serious serious warnings to mowe down a bite of protein before you wait a hour to be seated another hour or more for food.  At least the famously delicious fried pickles arrived hot and on time.  Overall,  the food was not over the top, the atmosphere and decor, great, the clientele I wouldn't exactly classify a dudes with their hats on backswards as hipsters, too clean.  More like backwoodsy tryin' to be hipsterish.   Unfortunately for the server though apt...we agreed not to leave any gratuity.  His answers of 30 minutes turned into 2 hours.  Although they were featured on food network...that just might be a slight downgrade."
"1","I could just put a sad face here, and leave it at that, but then you wouldn't know the excruciating time we had at this place. Wow. I am EXTREMELY disappointed and I don't give one star reviews lightly!! \n\nAfter hearing how great this place was over and over and over, and that it was on Diners, drive Ins and dives I HAD to go. I'm a sucker for that sorta thing, and man did this place miss the mark. I can honestly say unless they make some serious changes I may never go back or give it a second glance. \n\nParking was an adventure at this place.. the only spots open were close to a curb, so I decided to take my SUV and pretend it was a Jeep Wrangler. I got so frustrated trying to find a place to park on an empty stomach that I seriously just baja'd over the curb and bounced into the small spot that was waiting. \n\nWhen we came in, I was excited about this place. It had that old divey dinerish feel that I love and I figured there was NO way this place could be a miss. We got the menu and I thought everything sounded amazing! I ended up opting to make my own burger. Egg, mozzarella cheese & mayo. Pretty simple right? Well not for our server, she was apparently still drunk from her binge the night before. I know this because she told us, in her half arsed attempt of an apology. Sigh. I'll get there, don't you worry. \n\nI got my burger with fries. I'd asked for onion rings.... That wasn't that big of a deal, but it was only the beginning to the train wreck that was coming. The burger looked fantastic, and I couldn't wait to try it! Well I took that first bite and there was a taste I wasn't expecting... ONIONS. Really? So you forget the onion rings but you apparently added them to my burger, and went sans mayo. Good thing I like onions I guess. I just ate the burger and didn't say anything at first. \n\nMy boyfriend ordered the BBQ sandwich with the sauce on the side and no coleslaw. She brings him the BBQ with no sauce, and coleslaw slathered on the top of it. He has to remind her that he asked for no coleslaw and the sauce on the side. She brings him two types of sauce to try and the sweeter of the two is a mustard based. How do I know this? Because she mixed the mustard in and a fat layer of yellow was on top the the smokey red. She didn't even mix it up or anything. Normally I'm not this picky of a person, but with every single thing that happened, I had enough. \n\nWe asked her for a box twice, and took home the leftovers. She did apologize about her screw ups, and said, \""I'm so sorry, I think I'm still half drunk. I'll give you a free dessert.\"" I almost didn't get the dessert because by this point I had better things to do than spend any more of my time at the penguin. But she said banana pudding and I thought maybe that would bring them back up a star. She brought it over, I took a few bites and I just wasn't impressed. \n\nWhen we got home my stomach was all torn up, and I ended up throwing away the left overs. I didn't want to feel that way two days in a row. UGH. Sorry for the long winded review, but I warned you. \n\nMy take on this place: :( Save your money, and keep the experience of what you saw on TV in your heart. This place is sure to disappoint."
"1","This place is not the same anymore.... Waited about an hour to get mediocre food... even the atmosphere is pretty lame now."
"1","Very disappointed in this restaurant.\n\nWhen we moved to Charlotte, The Penguin came highly recommended by locals so we wanted to check it out. We stopped in around 2pm on a Saturday hoping to have a good time. The waitress (I hesitate to give her this title because her apathetic attitude hardly lived up to anything resembling that of a waitress) was slow, inattentive and rude. I ordered the chicken tenders and 25 minutes later she stopped by the table and stated \""what else do you want besides the chicken tenders\"" rather than apologizing that they were out of chicken tenders and offering to show me a menu so I could choose another option. I reluctantly  chose the mac and cheese and over the next 25 minutes was actually looking forward to them, but maybe that was just the intense hunger I was feeling after the long wait. When the food arrived, a basket of chicken tenders were placed in front of me as the waitress mumbled \""oh, guess there were chicken tenders\""  The entire order was incorrect and and the food was almost inedible. I don't complain about waiting a little longer  food if the food and service is worth it. Unfortunately, the food fell short of mediocre. Our food showed up cold and was not good."
"1","Let me start out by saying that I USED to love the Penguin- before it switched management. (If you want the old Penguin awesomeness, see The Diamond.)\n\nThe new Penguin is not great. Used to be crowded and jovial and loud- now it's virtually empty and so, so quiet. \n\nThey were out of a handful of things that our group ordered (some of the sodas, chicken wings, etc.). Our waiter would take orders, come back, tell us they were out, take a new order, come back. This happened 2 or 3 times.\n\nI also requested a veggie burger with no bun, but iceberg lettuce in place of a bun. Like a veggie burger between 2 pieces of lettuce. This request absolutely blew our waiters mind and, while he treated me like a culinary genius from that point on, it really isn't an innovative enough idea that a waiter should be surprised by it. Or need a 5 minute explanation about it. \n\nWhen the food came (it took a while), most of us were missing toppings or sides. None of the veggies that should have come on my burger were there. The onions that my husband requested were not there. \n\nI actually feel bad for the staff. I have a sneaking suspicion that our waiter hadn't gotten proper training and maybe communication between staff and management is poor. I blame management, not the wait staff.  It's such a shame- The Penguin used to be so awesome."
"4","I dare you to think about The Diamond without also thinking of The Penguin. Seriously, go on, try. You can't. The situation that went down at the end of The Penguin's last life turned into that big hubbub which rolled nicely over into hype, hope and hyperbole of how The Diamond would save us all, forever - or at least for lunch and dinner. Time passed, The Diamond doors and shutters stayed frustratingly closed even though we KNEW something was going on. I think by the time they posted on their Facebook page on Valentine's Day the hint that this would, at long last, be THE week of arrival for our blue-hued savior, the line was forming from the front doors down to Elizabeth. \n\nI was lucky enough to be one of the chosen few to attend a preview night before the opening so I could go forth and spread the word of Brian & Jimmy. We were the first in the door on Wednesday night and I got that nervous feeling like I'd had too much coffee and snuck into a movie. I ordered the legendary Full Hemi and fried pickles - is there any way to start this food affair without a burger? - and I was reasonably pleased. The burger was a bit different, most noticeably that it held together. Everything else about the food was just like I remembered The Penguin. I snuck in again on Friday on the official opening day and had an experience much like I used to get midday at that legendary dive; sitting up at the bar counter and chatting aimlessly with someone from a much different walk of life from us Plaza-Midwood hipsters while I noshed on (yes, another) burger. I caught a glimpse into the kitchen in back and made eye contact with my neighbor, one of the cooks - he gave me a perfect look of exasperation and mimed pulling out his hair. Opening day (and week, and month) at the Diamond was in no way a walk in the park.\n\nI heard and read quite a few reviews of really bad service in those first few weeks. Honestly, I'm not too surprised - the place was in such a panic in the beginning there that I'm sure the staff had absolutely no clue how to keep up. That doesn't excuse the bad service, which there probably is, but I can understand being overloaded operationally. It's rough and I really do hope that they can get it under control. There's so many new things on the menu that the staff, though experienced from the bird, has to learn how to manage a whole new level of complexity in the kitchen. They will get it, eventually. The hype didn't give them much time to get up to speed before they became The New Place To Have Lunch and Dinner for everyone.\n\nI've branched out a bit on the last few visits, and I've found many things on the menu that were decent to great. The meatloaf was okay, a little crunchy for my tastes; the sides were awesome (especially a killer mac 'n cheese) and the fries were a heck of a lot better than the Penguin's bag potatoes. \n\nSee, there I go again. Talking about the Penguin. How can you not?\n\nThe real \""a-ha\"" moment I had was my visit last night with Danielle - I got a Small Block with bacon & cheese (old habits die hard) and she ended up with the Po' Greek Boy platter. My burger was the best I'd had there yet (I think they're starting to get the hang of the new recipe) and the fried pickles were exactly as crisp as I hoped for. But then I took a bite of the Po' Greek Boy and it was like a switch flipped in my head. This was an awesome new flavor to me: lamb patty with tzatziki sauce and some fixins on a bun. Maybe you have had it, but I definitely never had, and my taste buds did that little happy dance you'd see in cartoons. I suddenly could not wait to try the new ideas that Brian & Jimmy mixed up for The Diamond's menu. Service is rough right now, yeah, but this is an experienced crew that took a crummy dive and turned it into a legend. I wouldn't be surprised if we see more five-star reviews months or years down the road. So as I chewed and savored the Po' Greek Boy aftertaste, I reached my thesis statement for this review, words with which I hope you will swirl around in your mind as you contemplate The Diamond:\n\nThe greatness of The Diamond lies not in the nostalgia and revival of its past; the greatness of The Diamond lies in the promise and potential of its future.\n\nSo chew on that! I'll be back."
"2","I hate to be the bad news bear, but 3rd visit last night for dinner, and the food & service were both not the best.  I had the 3 veggies plate with mac & cheese, collard greens, and cream squash.  I also had a few bites of the fried pickles.  Fried pickles were good.  Mac & cheese was moist and cheesy and acceptable.  Collard greens was under cooked in my opinion and I have had better home cooked greens than that.  Cream squash was OMG kinda not good.  It was so watery, for a moment I thought I had ordered cream OF squash soup.  Waitress wasn't too friendly at all.  I doubt it's a surprise that it's going to be busy at dinner time, so why not put that frowny face away and put a freaking smile on!\n\nSeriously, I'm getting tired of all the hypes floating around town about these hip new places.  So far I've been disappointed by most of them."
"3","Both my brother and I went there for our first time after hearing all the hype. We both had the single block burger. I wanted to try the big block but not going to pay $8.00 for a double cheese burger and no side included. So we both ordered the single block ($4.75) with cheese which is extra 50 cents. So total $5.25 for a single cheese burger in my mind thats a pretty expensive burger to not come with anything at all. And an order of fries to split. It took about 15 min for the burgers to come out and the place was not busy at all. Once we finally got the burgers, they were pretty good but I will say it was not worth the money to me. Fries were soggy. I also noticed online there menu prices are lower then what they are in the restaurant so I guess they up'ed there prices recently. \n\nOverall I will say the burger was good, had good flavor, and came out correct. I just feel that the food is a little over priced for being a \""diner\""."
"2","I really, really want to like The Diamond. It's cheap, convenient to my house, and my friends like it. Maybe I'm ordering the wrong things, but I'm just not even impressed enough to want to go without being decently drunk first. The first two times I went, I got breakfast food. Breakfast is kind of why I go to diners, I love it. Unfortunately, the Diamond can't manage cooking scrambled eggs. They came out rubbery and overdone both times. \n\nMy friends agreed that their breakfast is terrible and said I just had to try their lunch/dinner menu instead. Well, I gave it a shot with one of their signature sandwiches, a pork burger with onions, bacon, and cheddar. Three bone shards later, I decided I couldn't finish my pork burger and moved on to the sweet potato fries I had paid an upcharge to get. Mushy. My friend's regular fries tasted great, but they didn't get the sweet potato ones right. \n\nThe $20-for-2 dinner bill would have been a consolation if only the service had been quick enough to bring us our bill and the extra meal we had ordered. Unfortunately, just like some of our party's drinks and silverware, the server had forgotten and we had to wait another 15 minutes while they hustled it out of the kitchen. Meh."
"4","My boyfriend and I came to Charlotte from LA, and were looking for a good bar to grab some drinks, some food, and some fun, and we were not disappointed at all. We found the back patio, and had a great time drinking well priced beer and playing ping pong. Dinner was also great. I had the crab cake sandwich on a croissant, and it was delicious. \n\nSounds like when it's super busy the service get bad, but we were there early on Friday, and had no trouble getting drinks and service with a smile."
"3","Thomas Street Tavern has a great atmosphere and is really a very cool place to go to but the prices are definitely NOT cool. I went on my birthday a few weeks ago and was pretty disappointed in the drink prices and the bartenders. They were really not very friendly and wouldn't even recommend any drinks to us. Definitely a great atmosphere but not worth the $$"
"1","Walked in and ignored by both the bar tender and the server. When we got the server's attention and asked to be seated it seemed like we were interrupting her. \n\nWe walked...."
"4","seems to be a great little venue.  Large selection of beer, could use a few more bathroom stalls, but can't really knock that.  sound is good, acts are fresh, enjoy that that they bring in local's to open.  would love if i could get a slice of pizza or something to nosh on before the show starts.  but those are all minor complaints.  will be back soon, wish more people in charlotte saw live music."
"4","I love The Evening Muse. Such an intimate venue in the heart of NoDa. \n\nGreat place to catch a duo on tour or head over on Mondays for open mic. Seen many a show here and have never been disappointed. You can't go wrong with the bar either. A few local options and all come in venue-friendly bottles. Beware: there is a tab limit if you're using a card. I think its $6, unless it has changed recently. \n\nIt's a great place to stop in and take a load off. Listen to the local talent and take in the arts district. There are typically seats put out for all but its even better when it's standing room only. You can pack a surprisingly large group of people in this little place. \n\nYou can buy tickets ahead of time on their website, too. Don't always have to pay at the door. \n\nYou can't go wrong with The Evening Muse. What a great place for music, poetry and general assembly of beer-craving locals!"
"5","An independently owned and operated local music venue!\nSupport your local music scene!!\n\nWent here for the first time to see James Lastra perform his first professional gig.\n\nThis is a great venue for local artist to perform. It seats about 80 and they have enough room for about 40 additional SRO.\n\nMost of the staff are performers themselves so they are ready to assist with your equipment set up.\n\nThe acoustics are great, the atmosphere has a very funky vibe to it.\nThey have a full service bar as well."
"5","I am a big fan of live music and have heard it played in many venues. But, the Evening Muse is my favorite venue anywhere for a pure music experience. The owner, Joe, is also the sound man and he is a perfectionist. The setting is intimate but transitions well from solo acoustic to more hard rocking grooves. They book bands and people who you have heard of and who you have not heard of, but regardless, it will be good. I like to go see someone I have not heard of and usually I walk away a fan. I remember one time I thought Don Dixon was playing and I went but it turns out it was the next night. Instead, it was Sally Jaye, a singer songwriter based in L.A. She was great and I left with her CD which bears repeated listening."
"3","This place is like an art gallery and clothing store in one.  You walk in and it's like a museum with all the wall hangings they have for sale.  They also have wooden sculptures, carved furniture and all kinds of decorations for your home.  \n\nThen at the back of the store they have the clothes.  Both men's and women's styles both traditional inspired and very modern looking.  They also have lots of unique jewelry and accessories as well."
"4","Wow, I'm really surprised by the negative reviews. \n\nI'm not a \""car person\"" and I tend to be a bit of a \""slob\"" in my car. My dogs tend to shed all over the car also. Being far too lazy to attempt to clean the car myself I love Autobell's basic car wash. \n\nThe guys do a quick vacuum, send it through the auto wash and then do the detail work - windows, wipe down and generally for my dog hair riddled car- a 2nd vacuum. \n\nIt's not the equivalent of a real detail job but the results for the price are more than adequate and make me feel like I have a respectable car... at least for a few days!"
"3","This is a fun place and a cool place, but I'll have to visit it again to hopefully up the star rating in the future.  I have the misfortune of working out this direction and was pleasantly surprised to see South 21 Drive-in sticking out in a neighborhood of dilapidated buildings and BLAH-chain restaurants/stores.  I originally was worried that the place had closed down since it was never open when I drove by (after 10pm or on Sundays).  Some research online produced the food network visit and a menu and the date was set for my GF and I to drive out here for a visit.\n\nMy dire poverty makes this roughly the one time I ate at a restaurant in many months, so we went into this with pretty high expectations and an equivalent level of excitement.  We got there a little bit later than we had hoped and although the staff didn't rush us, I felt rushed because I knew they'd be closing soon.  We got a super-boy, a cheeseburger, onion rings, and two milk shakes.  I really made a huge splurge and spent about $16.  The burgers were ok, but nothing like I had imagined, they were pretty run of the mill and not nearly as good as I had hoped. I had been craving a non-chain, off the griddle, greasy burger and this one was slightly dry and without a whole lot of taste.  We didn't realize that to get the specialty with \""slaw\"" and other \""fixin's\""you need to ask for it \""Carolina Style.\""  The onion rings were OK, but not that fresh, so I'd like to try them again earlier in the evening.   The milkshakes were also just OK.  The people were nice and the owner seemed like a nice guy and he asked us how things went.  (my GF randomly ran into him on his day off and he was also pleasant... I like to buy food/things from good people so this is a plus in my book).  \n\nAll-in-all not bad, but not right on the mark.  I'd love to go back again though and do it right, especially if I could go on a nice summer day (are there any in Charlotte that aren't too hot though!?!).  It's a place with history and fun in a city that has converted most of it's history into parking lots, so it's worth a try!"
"1","My last interaction at this branch was beyond frustrating. In an attempt to finalize a few matters dealing with my late husband's finances, I requested assistance at this branch.\n\nI understand why they did not help. It wasn't that they could not. It was at the (acting) manager's discretion, as explained to me by Wells Fargo customer service when I called their toll free number.\n\nWhat I can't appreciate is the manner in which the (acting) manager chose not to help, which included lying about \""federal regulations\"", refusing to honor checks written on a Wells Fargo account by a government agency, and refusing to honor documentation from the Mecklenburg county courthouse.\n\nThe customer service I received at this branch was the proverbial straw.\n\nI finalized my business with Wells Fargo yesterday.\n\nGood riddance..."
"2","Called a to-go order in last night around 12:30 am. I thought I would make it easy so I ordered two of the exact same breakfast. 2 eggs over medium, sausage patties and french toast. Eggs cooked perfect. French toast some battered and some not. Sausage patties? They gave me one order and they were way overcooked. Sausage probable sat all day and they only had one order so instead of cooking fresh order they gave me only one order. \nThe food is good for what it is but check your to-go orders carefully"
"1","Food Network Fail. Horrible service, had to ask server FOUR times for SILVERWARE. Meal took an hour and fifteen minutes after being seated. Requested cocktail sauce, received barbecue sauce. Fries were served cold. Fish sandwich was full of bones and served on a stale bun. Very disappointing."
"4","I love having this place so close to home.  You can depend on them for all the basics when you're feeling a little Asian inspiration in the kitchen.\n\nI especially like the people who work there.  They're always friendly and will help you out if you can't find what you need.\n\nThe fresh produce/meat/fish components of this shop are a little . . . well, kinda dicey, but otherwise, thumbs up all the way."
"4","One of my favorite lunch spots in the city.  \n\nI've heard other say \""stay away from the sushi,\"" so, I have, however, their hibachi is delicious and incredibly inexpensive for the quantity & quality of food you receive.  ~$8 for a small basic salad (nothing special), cup of soup (ok), and a GIANT platter of hibachi meat, veggies and rice.  Really really good.  Never too crowded in my experiences during normal lunch hours.  Staff are pleasant but not overly talkative.\n\nAnother reviewer gave parking 2 stars.  Not sure why - I've never had any problem with parking a few spots away from the front door.\n\n2 things bother me, but neither enough to get me to not come back once a month:  1)  It's an old gutted Pizza Hut that is long overdue for a re-haul of the interior.  2) It's on Independence.  Making a U-Turn on Independence, at least in certain stretches, is nearly impossible for miles on end.  Just not very easy for me to get to regularly."
"5","One of Charlotte's best kept secrets on Eastway?  Maybe so, I never would have ever went into this place if my cousin told me how great it was. I did not know that they were affiliated with the other Charlotte locations. I love how they have some of the best \""New York Style Pizza\"" in Charlotte. Most places that claim they have the best have garbage in my opinion. \n\n\nThe service is really great as well, our server would come by every few minutes to check on us and we would chat with him for a good bit too. Dining in makes me feel I am in a Romano's to some extent. The subs are good, I generally would get the meatball one."
"5","Being half-Asian growing up in Gastonia I never had my hair cut by an Asian stylist for 22 years. After the FIRST haircut I was addicted! The staff is welcoming and give the best head massages during shampooing. The stylist really studied my hair beforehand to know how it would lay after being cut and styled. I enjoyed my experience so much I returned every 2 months! I've lived overseas for the last year and a half and can't wait to go back!"
"1","I called to make an appointment here and for my hair length they said it was $25 for shampoo and blow dry. For my brother $13. The salon is located in a pretty run down area. The lady who washed my hair gave the best head massage. I got my hair cut from Jean. I asked for long side bangs and ended up with fringes, I asked for long layers in my hair and to thin it out a little (cause I have pretty thick hair for an Asian) and ended up with choppy long layers that aren't even. On the right side of my head, I have short pieces of hair from getting thinned out so much and on the left I have long layers not thinned out. You can imagine the horror I felt. When I went to go pay they told me my haircut was $28 and my brothers $16. Will not return."
"5","The only bad thing about this place is the que! Other than that the service is efficient the results are delicious and you can see them making it, pretty cool!! What a way to cool down after a day of walking around the city!"
"5","I Love this place they have the best Burgers!! I find myself here on random Sundays and the ladies working here are great they have definitely been here for a long time and know everything on the menu!! The food is always great - i seriously always get a burger but we start with the wings with the sauce on the side and they are really good nice and crispy!!  The BF gets the Fried Oysters Appetizer its a HUGE portion and plenty on there that he cant even finish himself!! The only thing I would say negative was we went when it was 100 out and it was pretty warm in there but they cant help it with an open kitchen. Its a great place in a great area!"
"3","I planned an event here with some girlfriends for an early dinner. The place is easy to miss, because it's a small building so if you blink or aren't paying attention you will get lost (trust me...I know). Also, just a head's up with the place being so small parking is a bit of a pain. In fact it's pretty non-existent. There's a few spaces in the front and if you're lucky they have a few in the back...if all those are full....good luck! \n\nThat being said, the menu is pretty simple. I think they are going for down home favorites. There are your staple dishes like meatloaf, burgers, fish and salads. But I just wasn't overly impressed with the menu. I opted for the Veggie Burger and fries. It's your typical Morning Star veggie burger so nothing to be amazed about there and the fries were just okay. \n\nThe service was great but I'm just not sure I'd make it a priority to give them another try. Based on the reviews, their brunch might be worth another visit. We'll see!"
"3","I thought Taipei express was pretty damn good.  The shrimp in the Shrimp Lo Mien were plump and nicely browned, and there were plenty in my order.  The Sesame Chicken was juicy and the sauce was sweet and tangy.  I did not eat too much of the browned rice, but the chicken wings were crunchy, salty, meaty and tasty, especially with a splash of mustard and duck sauce.  The dumplings were massive, the biggest I've ever seen.  They were a little doughy, but the pork inside was nicely seasoned, and the sauce was delicious.  \n\nThe orders were large as well.  I ate my fill last night, and still had enough Lo Mien left to have a nice sized lunch today.  For the money I'd say Taipei Express is a great deal, true its not gourmet, but it is good... the portions are large and the prices are reasonable.  I have to disagree with Jason L. on this one and give Taipei Express a thumbs up, try it for yourself, and let us know what you think."
"2","It was okay. The server at the counter was more concerned with the call-in orders, which I guess is more common at this location due to the small amount of tables, but disappointing. It took me over 5 minutes to place my order. After being seated, with no one else there, I retrieved my order and was satisfied, but not impressed. The meal was very greasy & the rice and egg roll were so over-cooked. Won't bother again."
"3","If you're a work from homer, then sometimes you just need to get out of your crib and find a quiet spot to be all kinds of productive. Sometimes this \""productive place\"" outside the home is a local coffee shop, a cafe or even (gasp) a library. Yes, folks, a library. Where it's supposed to be all sorts of quiet and somber. I decided to pack up my laptop and bring her to the Myers Park library branch yesterday to focus and be productive outside of my house.\n\nHere's the thing about the major changes with the Char/Meck library systems as of late, because of the budget squeezes, funding cuts and closings around the county, the libraries are really full at really odd times. Like a Tuesday afternoon. I figured this out yesterday as I tried to grab a cubby and get some work done. No such luck. No open tables, either. And really though, I can't blame them. This particular branch is pretty small and doesn't have a ton of \""working\"" space. Plus, because many of the other (larger) branches are closed on Tuesdays, the Myers Park branch gets a ton of their overflow. \n\nThus, the library was chock full of kids, Internet surfers and folks coming in and out to use their services. I take no issue with the crowded factor, as this branch is clearly serving its community and its needs. Yay for that! Just keep it in mind that this may not be as quiet as you think!\n\nThe folks who work here are very, very sweet and helpful. Not only did they help me find a few books for an upcoming beach trip, but I also overhead them helping anyone and everyone with a question or issue. As previously mentioned, there is a bank of individual cubbies for the working bees and a few tables near the back if you're lucky enough to score one. Literature wise, this is a small branch. But I highly recommend searching for your books online and you can request that the be put on hold at whichever branch you like. Thus, whichever library that has said book(s) will send them over to the Myers Park branch (or whichever branch you designate online) and they will notify you when they are ready to be picked up. Stroll on over to the branch, pick up your books, hit up the self-checkout and poof! Instant literature bliss.\n\nA few other things to note about this particular location: the parking is easy but can be tight when they are busy. They offer free WiFi and have a small, but diverse, selection of magazines and media at your disposal. Here's hoping that the county figures it out and supports our library structure as a whole. They should be open every day, folks."
"3","A Charlotte staple in need of a makeover. Generally solid food but sometimes inconsistent - biggest challenge is the atmosphere which is stale and hasn't kept up with the rest of the Charlotte restaurant scene. You can't go wrong by a visit to PC - especially if the weather is nice and you get to sit on the excellent patio. Salads are great here."
"2","Went for dinner the other night, the place was pretty empty (not usually a good sign).  The place looked pretty nice but the food was very average.  Except for some mandarin oranges we were served which had turned, pretty drastically rancid.  Service was good, I don't know maybe we came on an off night, but I kind of doubt it..."
"3","I made a VERY LAST SECOND appointment here and the staff was so accommodating and terrific.  It was my first time, and when I checked in, they gave me a free pen, pamphlet of services, and a sample of hair products.  My waxer, Kim was really nice, but at nearly $100 for a bikini and underarm wax, I was surprised when she used strips, and not hard wax.  My underarm wax has grown in less than a week later, which is disappointing.\n\nIf the prices came down a lot (like maybe to $60 for both services) I might have thought it was worth it.  However, in my opinion, it was just too expensive for the quality.  But the staff and people are great.\n\nI was a bit annoyed, however, after the fact, they texted me and emailed me.  The texting feels a little personal, and maybe a little violating from a place I only visited once."
"1","Any Northerener who says this place is good is an idiot.  It is average pizza doused with olive oil.  It is so horrible.  Try Luigi's in South Charlotte.  Try Sabarro's downtown.  Wolfman sucks.  This place is like a southerner ordering barbaque in NYC .  SUUUUUCCCCKKKKKSSSSS"
"1","The pizza is decent, but delivery is an epic failure.  Put an order online at 6:50 PM.  Estimated delivery was 7:50 PM, which is long to begin with considering that Wolfman is only 2 miles away from my address.  At 8:00 PM called and was told the order went out the door.  At 8:20 PM called and was told general manager was now delivering the pizza.  At 8:50 PM (2 hours after ordering) called again and found out the order was never pulled from online.  Bad process and bad employees who lied twice times.\n\nPizza maybe, technology no.  Don't order from Wolfman unless you are going to sit there or pick it up yourself.\n\nEpic fail!"
"5","This little garden is a beautiful Charlotte treasure. The website does a good job of setting the romantic scene, but nothing can prepare you for how special this place really is.\n\nNot only is it a great place to walk with a loved one and enjoy the birds or to go find some clear mental space in your alone time, they have a fabulous plant sale a few times a year. The fall one is coming up, and I'm planning on attending to get all my essentials for the garden this season. They've got some great options, and one of the best selections in our area. \n\nThey've also got some interesting lectures occasionally to help would-be gardeners figure out the ins and outs of the plant world, and often the price of the lectures include a fresh lunch, usually made up of local food. You feed your brain, your belly, and your soul!"
"4","Probably one of the \""hidden gems\"" in Charlotte, I discovered Wing Haven during a Bike!Charlotte Bingo Bike Ride on a nice Saturday afternoon.  The bike loop started at SouthEnd and cut through downtown/Noda/Plaza Midwood/the greenway and led us to Wing Haven.  \n\nI have lived in Charlotte for 17 years now and this was the first time I had ever heard of Wing Haven.  It's really tucked inside the middle of a neighborhood street - almost inbetween the Dilworth and Sewlyn areas.  I'm sure the houses that surround Wing Haven are used to the business being there but the \""NO WING HAVEN\"" parking signs our in front of people's yards give me a good sense that this place can draw a crowd when it wants to.\n\nIf you are a bird lover, outdoor lover, or unique place lover... this is definitely a good spot.  I think you can rent out the space for small events and there are plenty of activities for small children to do and see."
"5","We just took our maltipoo here for the first time today and they did a wonderful job. He not only looks great, but he was very happy and loved the employees (rare since they had just groomed him). We are definitely going back!"
"1","Our waitress would disappear randomly from time to time. Ordered the fried pickles and they were so salty no one in my group could eat them. Told the waitress about it and her response was \""Yeah, we get that complaint all the time\"". She took it off our bill, but the food being so horrible and the bad waitressing our experience was pretty bad.  Not to mention the quesadilla's were not edible. Pizza was mediocre at best. If you go there, go for the beer only!"
"3","If grandma's creative brain exploded on a Sunday afternoon, this is what it would look like.  They have paints, glues for any surface or material, brushes, picture frames all shapes and sizes, seasonal arts and crafts, beads and bedazzlers, candles galore, styrofoam in weird shapes and blocks, construction paper, wood shelving that you can stain or color any way you like, fake flowers, glass containers, etc.  Also, if you're into scrap-booking Michael's is probably a dream come true."
"3","I spent many summers practically living at Michael's...and now I have plenty of scrapbooks to show for it! \n\nI love craft stuff! Michael's is a great place for most of your craft making needs. They have a good selection of scrapbooking supplies, silk floral supplies, and baking stuff...you'll stay very busy once you spend an afternoon in here. \n\nThey do not have a fabric section and I've found that there are other craft stores with a larger selection (e.g., Hobby Lobby). However, this Michael's is in a great location and is a pretty good size."
"3","Thank goodness for Michaels!\n\nWhere the \""semi-creative\"" can actually pull something together and create a masterpiece. Haha! \n\nI was \""tasked\"" (ugh) to pick up supplies for our pumpkin contest at work. We had a \""theme\"" (kinda)...but no clue of how to make that happen. Thank goodness the staff was helpful! Walking into Michaels can be a bit overwhelming...ok, extremely overwhelming, especially with a not well thought out vision. However, I'm pleased to say I managed to leave with some good stuff and my co-workers were happy.  \n\nSo then why just three stars??? Simply put this store is just way too cluttered. It's not necessarily the fault of the staff, they really have no control of people leaving stuff just anywhere but it can make it hard finding what you need when you have to dig through cards, glitter ornaments, plastic flowers and stickers. \n\nBut if you are every tasks out for work projects, I definitely recommend stopping here to get the creative juices flowing."
"5","When I lived nearby, I would eat here at least once a week.  You can't go wrong here.  The menu is centered on roasted chicken.   You can get it with Jaco sauce, black beans, whole chicken etc.  They have a large variety of sides that are just as good as the entrees.  It is a very fast-order at the counter type of place.  It is cheap, filling, and very tasty."
"5","The value here is outstanding.  They have the tastiest chicken and I'm really baffled by some of the reviewer's who didn't like it.  I lived in Charlotte the past three years and ate here frequently.   The squash casserole and buttered spinach are my favorite sides and the cornbread - YUM!"
"2","Hadn't been in years. Now there is a bar. Food is frozen in time - same exact stuff as ten years ago. Mediocre."
"2","I was a little disappointed with Omega Sports to be honest. I'm not a big fan of the large chain sporting good stores (Sports Authority, Dick's) & thought this place might be a nice change from those. But I was wrong, this is basically the same type of place, just smaller with bigger prices.\n\nThey didn't seem to have a vast selection of anything, because they try to sell everything, if that makes sense. They have footwear, college apparel, tennis rackets, fitness apparel, baseball goods, so on & so on. But by their store being limited in size, trying to sell goods for every single sport leaves you with less room to have a big selection within each category. So the items are watered down & they can't specialize in having unique items for every sport, just your basic goods. But I will say the service here seems friendly & willing to help, even though I wasn't in the buying mood.\n\nOmega Sports seems like a locally owned sporting goods store trying to directly compete with the big chain sporting good stores. I hate to say it, but they just seem like a smaller, more run down version of these stores with nothing really intriguing to entice customers away from the big chains. If you're looking for a basic sporting good item they'll probably have what you're looking for, but don't expect a vast selection of things."
"3","I went here with a group of friends one night after we got out of a seminar. This place is opened 24 hours I believe so if you're looking for a late night dine in restaurant besides your Ihop and Denny's this would be the place to go. I had their homemade lasanga dish and it was delicious! \n\nThe service is not as great at night (after midnight) and you'll start to see a whole bunch of drunk/dramatic people coming in around 1-2am. I think the experience would've been better if I went during the day. But overall they have a good choice of food on their menu."
"3","I've had night and day experiences at this location - seriously, during lunch and then late night.  During the day, their staff is super friendly (dare I say too much friendly sometimes?) and their service is fast. I might almost give them 4 stars. But this past weekend, I got sucked in by marketing for their Smothered Burrito and drove through around midnight. They had no non-sweet-tea (I go half-and-half usually, sorry I am not from the South!) and in spite of ordering a beef burrito, having the manager who was running the drivethru then ask me beef, chicken or steak (beef!) and my receipt saying beef... I ended up with Chicken. Guess I should stick to the day shift for my nacho cheese addition!"
"3","Pretty good pizza, not the best I've ever had but if you like good basic sauce and brick fired pizza this is a nice place.\n\nWe frequent here because they have good sauce and the sauce does not have garlic in it so if you know someone with a garlic allergy you'd understand that to find good pizza where the sauce does not have garlic in it is unusual.\n\nThe decor is a little outdated so don't expect to be overwhelmed with a trendy look. I think by my count there are 2 TVs in the place, not real big TVs but they have them. \n\nGood pizza place off the beaten path, it is on top of a small shopping center. There is no elevator (that I saw) so not sure if accessible."
"5","Luisa's claims that for years they tried to get the authentic taste of pizza they remembered from \""the old country\"". Nothing they tried seemed to produce the flavorful pizzas they remembered in Italy. In an effort to reproduce the pizzas from their homeland, they went so far as to install a wood fired brick oven. Well, for them, this was the key to much success ! The pizzas here do have that extra something that puts them ahead of the competition. My wife's favorite food is pizza, and she has gone to some effort to hunt down by word of mouth the best here in Charlotte, and this tops the list. I can only take the word of the cooks, but the oven is the key. You can see right into the oven from the counter, and sure 'nuf, you can see the wood afire inside. We haven't tried the entire menu, but everything we've ordered here is excellent. Its just a little hard to find, but thats OK with me, otherwise it probably would be so crowded you couldn't get a table. I'd give it six stars if I could !"
"1","Was excited to come here. Brought kids. Awful service. Nasty. Got sick. Do not recommend."
"5","I trust Almar's to fix our three cars. They have been honest and upfront about repair options and costs. I called today when my Honda Pilot wouldn't not start. Andy was so helpful and gave me some ideas about what may be wrong. He was able to fit me in and replaced my battery quickly while I waited"
"2","I stopped here out of annoyance of having to wait at another salon & wanting to get the ordeal over with. I wanted a trim, I didn't need a trim. \nI walked in and was told 10 minutes, I was okay with that considering the place before offered a 45 min wait. \nI was promptly greeted and seated after the 10 min wait. I explained I need a trim because I was getting my hair done in twists the next day. The stylist offered to do a protein treatment and I agreed because I understood its benefits. Prior to beginning the treatment I stated I wanted to retain length versus being even!!\nWe proceeded with the conditioning process and everything was okay until the trimming process started.  Somewhere in my spirit it felt wrong as I watched the ends fall to my shirt. I made a comment about it being too much and she assured me it was just 2 ringlets nothing more. Once she got to the front my heart begin to panic as I realized that her method for cutting was so wrong...at that point it was too late. \nI paid and I left, due to me having a delayed response with things I didn't truly see that her trim equaled more than 1 & 1/2 inches of my hair being cut off due to her IMAGINARY split ends until later!!! I'm beyond distraught as I went from 3 inches to almost bra strap length in less than 3 years with no trim, to be knocked back a bit. I went in hoping to increase my efforts in achieving a solid bra strap length before the year was over. Her CUT vs TRIM set me back to the length of my hair in the winter time. -sigh- ughhh I hate it!!\nThey got 2 stars for being nice and readily available but I despise this trim, regret it. Enough to make me finally sit down and write a review. I've done a lot that needed a Yelp response but playing with my hair just set me off completely!"
"3","Located in Park Road Shopping Center, Ski Country Sports is a skinny store with a lot of stuff packed into it. The store goes back a good ways & they have everything you need for the slopes.\n\nFrom snowboards to clothing, this lodge themed store has it all. I checked out their cold weather gear & they had a good selection of jackets. The store is a little cluttered, but I guess they get as much into the small store as they can. \n\nOne odd thing about the store was a wall filled with tennis rackets. Uh, pretty sure tennis isn't a widely played sport along the slopes, but I checked them out anyway considering it's the only thing I have some knowledge about in a ski store.\n\nSki Country has a lot of ski related apparel & gear, obviously, so if I were a slope fan, I might head back here for some stuff."
"4","The Mecklenburg ABC store here is decent.\n\nSelections - They have all your spirits and liquids that you need.  They don't have my favorite cognac here, but that is okay. \n\nService - nice. I know you were eyeing at me, because of my age!! But rest assured, I am beyond old enough to drink. I will take that as a compliment.\n\nPrice - as any other ABC stores, just a tad bit pricier than I am used to. Just a 'tad' bit."
"2","Good service, pretty quick - but a total ripoff if you're looking for anything but a top - to - tails oil, fluid, filter change and detail experience. I'm a do-it-yerselfer on a lot of car stuff, so I wanted to come here for a simple oil change, and was told that that was not an option. I ended up spending 90 bucks for the whole shebang, and although the car looked great when they were finished (had an hour to wait that day, but Pappa's was withing walking distance, win!!) the fact that I wasn't given more options as to the level of service I required pissed me off."
"2","Short wait, and they did change my oil, so that was good.  But I won't go here again and this is why: They \""inflated\"" all my tires to 34 psi, even though they are rated for a higher pressure, and were in fact inflated to the proper, fuel saving pressure before the oil change.  By the time the guy came in the waiting room and told me that they had inflated all my tires to 34 psi, they had already rolled my car out, so it was too late.\n\nOn top of all that, they're not cheap, and they do that annoying thing where they try to sell you new air filters, trans service, yadda yadda yadda."
"3","This small place is not easy to find.  They have a good menu, I ordered the fried beef flat noodle to go.  It was just okay.  \nThe owner speaks Cantonese and I was able to chat with them a bit.  I think I need to order something else next time just so I can provide a better review for this place.  But the first dish didn't pass my test. \nI will go back to try other things."
"2","I really hate to jump on the bandwagon here, but this is not my favorite HT at all. \n\nI'm not a fan of the setup, for me it's really confusing layout. I didn't care for having to search for a sales person to help me and the lack of merchandise was not appealing either. \n\nI guess, if I was ever in a bind (like last night) this place is fine but it wouldn't be my first choice."
"3","Nice store... probably the largest Hallmark store I have ever walked into.  I'm used to the ones in the malls that are super tiny and have enough room for you to squeeze by people frantically looking for the card that \""says it all\"" for the occasion.\n\nOriginally I came here to get a box and bow for a present, but I ended up getting a gift bag instead.  The lady working gave me a ton of suggestions.  I don't know why I was dead-set on a box... I guess I need to be more creative in my gift giving practices.\n\nI couldn't really spend too much time here since I was in a rush, but I did enjoy what I saw and the selection."
"1","Worst customer service ever back in mid-January.  I'm a pretty chill, easy-going dude, but by the end of this visit I wanted to put every McD worker in a Ric Flair figure-four leglock. \n\nCashier was terrible.  Middle-aged dude looked like he was hating life (no comment here) and didn't greet patrons with anything more than a lazy nod.  He had to have been thinking, \""What the hell do you want?\""  A simple \""Hey, what can I get for you?\"" would have sufficed.\n\nI'm an optimist, but my orange juice was half-empty.  I hemmed and hawed about pointing it out, but did so.  Chick on duty returned with my juice filled with ice.  Really?  You don't think I can tell that its ice and not juice?  Later, chick said that the orange juice was not ready yet.  Might I suggest a solution?  GET IT READY - ICE IS NOT A SUBSTITUTE.\n\nBacon, Cheese & Egg Biscuit with no bacon, please.  It took them TWENTY minutes, FOUR different McD workers, and THREE breakfast sandwiches to get my friend's order right.  Not that difficult of an order - it doesn't mean a Sausage McMuffin without sausage; it doesn't mean a Bacon, Cheese & Egg Biscuit with egg; and it definitely doesn't mean a Sausage McMuffin without sausage, even the second time around.  \n\nDuring the BCE Biscuit incident, they still never gave me my coffee.  I politely informed the cashier, and the dude tells me he didn't forget it.  Let me guess, coffee beans aren't harvested yet and there wasn't even ice to try and trick me.  He then proceeded to pour me a cup.\n\nWhat a Mickey Mouse operation.  I will not come to this location again.\n\ndmo out."
"4","Our dinner was delicious and our waiter, Christopher, was the BEST! He made us feel special and took GREAT care of us! We definitely want to go back."
"4","Intimate ambiance with loads of old school, steak house charm.  This restaurant is a diamond in the rough on a busy stretch of South Blvd.  Go and enjoy your favorite cut of steak and rest assured that the service will be impeccable."
"2","If you like the early 1960s you will love this place if not stay away!  Food was average minus, walls were very dirty, service decent.  Would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.  I was told this restaurant was like Ruth Chris, don't believe it! Stay away."
"1","Over rated.Drinks and Food are over price."
"2","I've been to this establishment twice.  The first time we did not have a reservation.  We bellied up to the bar and waited, and waited and waited...eventually a table opened.  I had no complaints that night.  The food was lovely as was the atmosphere.\n\nFast forward to tonight.  We had a 5:30 reservation for a birthday celebration.  At 7:09 we were told that we needed to leave as the table was spoken for.  Now granted we were winding down anyways, but A) this was a terrible business practice and B) yes the table was spoken for, BY US.  They knew we were celebrating a birthday and did bring out a very lovely birthday surprise for the birthday girl.  But for 60 bucks a plate I do not expect to be rushed out the door.\n\nSo now that we've gotten the service outta the way - onto the food, this is a restaurant after all.  Well, my meal of tenderloin tips was super salty but still pleasant.  The dessert (key lime pie) was really good.  My dining companions had the special - a prime rib/ shrimp combo.  They said the shrimp scampi was really good, but they've had better prime rib.\n\nI'm just flummoxed, why would Beef and Bottle risk alienating customers?  I sure as heck won't be back.  Oh and I got sick from my meal - not sure if it was me or them, but after being rushed out the door I'm gonna say it was them!  I will not be back."
"2","Celebrated my mother-in-law 70th birthday dinner, the food was ok...some of the vegetables were cold, lobster tail was a bit salty; however the servers were nice."
"1","It amazes me that this store is still in business. I have been keeping saltwater fish and corals for 19 years and have never seen prices this high. I spoke with the owner Greg Sauers and it became crystal clear that he is out for your money. Also after speaking with an employee I was informed that the fish are not quarantined like they say and they lose a lot of fish to ick. Beware the positive reviews on Yelp and other sites as employees are also asked to give good reviews to boost up the stars. Fintastic is selling inferior livestock at a premium price. Greg told me the dry goods are so expensive because the Internet is his biggest competitor and after shipping his products will be cheaper. This is a flat out lie. He might have been able to get these prices when there was no competition in Charlotte, but that has changed. I hope this helps some people protect their tanks from crashing due to disease or poor information. STAY AWAY FROM FINTASTIC!!!"
"4","Love Sir Ed's!  They have the best veggie burger in town.  It reminds me of Cheers....once you visit a few times, they know your name and your drink.  I like their eclectic menu and love that they serve it late night.  Overall, great relaxed bar atmosphere complete with darts and good tunes in the juke box.  Great \""locals\"" spot!  Even better now that it's non-smoking.  That was only thing that bothered me about the place before."
"4","Awesome place to chill out away from the hustle and bustle of downtown.\n\nI usually go to Montford, but like to change it up at Sir Ed's from time to time.\n\n\nGotta get a Guiness when I go, how could you not?"
"1","I had the absolute worst experience here yesterday when I came here for my friend's birthday dinner. The waitress could not have been any more rude. I really don't think I've ever had such a rude waitress. \n\nOne of the many instances where she was rude was when she messed up my order. I politely asked about the missing cheese in my order of cheese fries. After she picked up the plate, my friend asked for his appetizer (she brought my order but hadn't taken his). She cut him off y sternly saying, \""How about I fix his fries first before they get cold?!\"" Then walked away. When she brought them back, she said, \""Next time you want cheese, tell me!\"" Our entire group was speechless.\n\nI have never had a worse experience at any restaurant in my life. I highly recommend you avoid the place."
"4","The food offerings are above and beyond normal pub fair, more interesting than the typical burgers and fries and also deliciously made. I especially enjoyed the tomato soup made with goat cheese, the goat cheese fritters, and the butternut squash croquettes. They have many local quality beers on draft and the atmosphere is a cozy dark would expect and enjoy from a pub."
"1","Just awful, the service is horrendous and I come here at least twice a week, well not any more .. If they are busy or not they don't acknowledge you, and they screw up the simplest order \""Everytime\"" I'm patient I have been in the service industry... Sometimes was they just put your food in their toaster and forget about you... Never again ... I'm finding an Einstein bagel..  This place sucks!"
"3","If this is a golf club, I'm the abominable snowman.  Looks like a pleasant place, but there sure as heck aren't any *golf* holes getting balled here."
"5","We found Portofinos a few months ago and have been back many times since.  The food is delicious, the service is wonderful with knowledgeable servers who can help point you in the right direction if you are caught in that enviable position where you can't decide between the three items on the menu that sound incredible.  \n\nThe music is just right and the cold, crunchy salad and the warm bread just give you an idea of the wonderful things to come.  \n\nThe chicken parm is out of this world and is a steady favorite for me while my wife tries something different each time all with the same end result that Portofino's on Park Road in one of our favorite restaurants in Charlotte."
"1","I came here abt two years ago to get my fix of ink. (they are addictive)\nWell, I drew my \""Tat\"" out so I figured how hard could it be to copy and paste right... RIGHTTTTT!!!!\n\nwell after Mr. What-Ever-The-Hell-His-Name is finished smoking (why do they have to smoke before work?) and started on my tat... when I looked at the clock go round and round and round (damn near 3 hrs) for a tat that was maybe 3inch by 3inch. \n\nNOTE... MY TATTOO was a Ying/Yang, with the two lil circles representing 2 clocks in the inside. (can you picture that.. right.. that ain't too hard right.?)\n\ni told buddy he did a \""great job\"" tipped the dude a few more bucks because i KNOW he needed it and wld probably be his last. \n\nWELP.. IT WAS.. a friend went (even after I told them where to go for good work) and wanted me to come with... and that person was NOT there anymore. \n\nalso.. i HATE when an \""artist\"" tells me what to get.. even when I tell them what I want and where i want it. THE NERVE of another artist to tell me NO, you should get it put ______ instead. GTHOH. \n\nI'M PAYING.. RIGHT?????........................... RIGHTTTT!!!!!!!!!"
"5","I love this chick fil a. The customer service is awesome. There are always employees asking if I need anything and making sure I am satisfied. Obviously a great place for kids. The outdoor space and playground is nice and well kept."
"2","-Cozy atmosphere in a nice building with great outdoor seating \n-Server (heavyset black woman) was bad and behaved inappropriately\n-Food is slightly pricey for some dishes. Flank steak was amazing. Pizza was okay. Nachos were standard fare. Nothing special here.\n-Girlfriend saw server (slender black lady) use restroom, pick her teeth, and leave restroom without washing hands! This was before we left. Awful!"
"5","Went back to VT last night to meet a friend, and the food, service and atmosphere was just as good if not better than my first trip here! \n\nFirst important tip: Wednesday is HALF OFF WINE night! Ya HOO! There are some exceptions on their \""higher end\"" stash, but I can live with the other choices. So I ordered a Meomi Pinot Noir, and for half off, the bottle only came to like $20 or so! GREAT Deal since that's about what it is in the stores (yes I know, but I've come to grips with the dreaded price doubling of wine in restaurants). \n\nSo to start, my friend recommended the freshly made chips with ranch sauce. Perfectly crispy, a little salt, and yummy ranch dressing. Spot on. Personally I would have liked a TAD more salt on them, but no major complaints.\n\nSo I've seen their steak menu and after a LONG, HARD workout, I convinced my body that I need PROTEIN to feed those muscles of mine.......my brain fought back but the muscles won! So I ordered the 10oz Filet, cooked medium rare (of course - I'm not a fan of shoe leather), and opted for their cognac cream sauce. I make a killer Au Poivre with Congna Cream sauce at home, so I admit to being a little snobby when it comes to this sauce. Quite frankly mine IS better, but this one was pretty good. I'd recommend the Bernaise Butter over the Filet though.....that will be my next choice. \n\nFor my side I chose the Gourmet Mac and Cheese and the Spinach. Both were excellent! The Mac & Cheese was very good as the outside was crispy (i.e., slightly burned) and I LOVE THAT! My only addition would be to add a dash of Truffle Oil. But that's just me......I'm a Truffle Oil fool. The spinach was cooked perfectly as it was sauteed in olive oil and garlic, with the requisite amount of wilting yet maintained a good firm texture. \n\nOK so I've talked about the sauce, but have been remiss to describe the FILET! One word: PERFECTION! The quality of the beef was excellent (Prime???) but it's the way it was prepared that was awesome. The outside was crispy due to the apparent high heat oven yet the inside was literally MELT IN YOUR MOUTH tender! And as you can see in the photos, it WAS cooked perfectly to Medium Rare. All this really needed was a little butter on top (again recommend the Bernaise Butter) and it was truly superb! Coming from a Beef town like Chicago, I am singing this restaurants high and well-deserved praise!\n\nAll in all this was a GREAT meal! Very reasonably priced for the quality of food served, and the service is always very, very good. \n\nKudos to the Management Team at VT! Don't know if that's recently changed or what given some of the pooer reviews from the past. But this is my thrid time here and all three times, each has been FIVE STAR EXPERIENCE!\n\nBravo!"
"2","I am new to the Charlotte area so I don't know if the sushi in this area is similar to Sushi 101 in quality, taste or size.  I do know that the menus I've reviewed online talk about sushi in different terms (i.e. \""crunch\"" instead of panko flakes).  The prices here are comparable to other sushi places I've eaten around the country.  I was unimpressed by the taste of the rolls, finding them rather bland.  I'm wondering if the fish was previously frozen instead of fresh but I'm really not sure.    The \""hot lava sauce\"" seems to be merely a puddle of sriracha sauce put on the side instead of being mixed in with Q-P mayo or some other ingrediant.  The rolls were rather loosely rolled, falling apart easily.   I thought the size of the rolls were rather small for the price though this may be standard for the area.\n\nAmbience and service were good but I hoped for better quality.  I doubt I would go back.  The sushi was in general mediocre."
"4","Love the dark bar look of this sushi place, among other things ;). They are consistent with the quality of food and service. Lunch time is usually hectic and it can sometimes take long. The staff is so helpful and know their menu. They have great, fresh sushi and reasonable prices. \n\nTry the edamame, seaweed salad and the Professor Vu."
"4","Had dinner here tonight. It was great! I enjoyed the ballantyne roll, surf n turf roll and the spicy katsu chicken roll.I ordered a side of miso soup and had kikkokomen plum wine. Yummy! Check out their menu for the roll ingredients. I was so hungry I forgot to take pics.If you are a sushi connoisseur like myself you might think the menu is a little commercial, but it's a great place to take a newbie sushi eater. There is something good to eat for everyone, no matter what their taste buds desire,even vegans. Check it out you wont be disappointed. Since it's Friday I expected them to be packed, but they weren't and i got my food in less than 15 minutes. My server Allison was great and she knew the menu and best tasty choices. The men who prepared my meal also greeted me and asked how I liked every thing."
"3","It's been a while since I've had my eyes checked, and even when I did, it was probably either to get my drivers license or just to look in a little machine and tell them what I saw.  I don't know if I've ever had a full-blown eye exam.  That's no longer the case.\n\nSince Denise has been jumping through hoops to have her eyes checked, it meant I needed to have mine done too, so I signed up so that they could see what's happening.\n\nThe Christenbury Eye Center is very professional, and they have quite the setup - you check in, and they shuffle you from room to room, where they (presumably) do all sorts of things to determine if your eyes are working or not.  Maybe they just pretend.  I don't really know.\n\nThey seem to know what they are talking about, and they have lots of famous people on the walls who say they know what they are doing, so that must make them experts, right?\n\nYou can also get laser eye surgery here, but after giving me drops to dilate my eyes (which screwed up my eyesight for the better part of the day - go figure), they told me that my eyes were just fine.  Hopefully I don't have to go back for a while."
"3","I know I said that they were professional and all, but the other day we received a bill for what the insurance wouldn't pay.  It came in a decent envelope, but then we opened it.\n\nPlain sheet of paper with printing.  No tear-off portion, no return envelope (not to mention return postage - I wouldn't expect that from anyone).  Just a sheet, badly folded, printed out on a cheap printer.\n\nSo much for professional.  I guess that only extends to examinations - and presumably procedures.  Definitely not to the billing department.  We get a lot of medical bills since we started buying our own insurance, and this is definitely the cheapest of the bunch.\n\nI get that it's only a few cents for an envelope and all - but it can't cost them much more to have some reasonably pre-printed invoices with tear-off return portions, much less a return envelope.  It would just make for a nicer experience, you know?"
"3","Typical mediocre American food. Menu covers a lot of bases. Food wasn't bad, but it was nothing exceptional and I would only recommend this place if you lived nearby and didn't want to drive further. Prices were fine - neither high or low. Service was friendly but at times the waiter dissapeared. I think he also forgot about my soup until I reminded him.\n\nThe she-crab soup was very rich and as another reviewed commented, decadent.\n\nWe ate at M5 the previous night and I'd go there again and again, but I would not go here again and again."
"5","Don't mess with entering off of Fairview or Sharon. Park in the back. Much easier in and out."
"4","Four stars for service and three stars for the food. I was in need of a very quick bite to eat Friday on my way to catch a movie. I always drive by Hotel Charlotte yet I never stop - well tonight was the night. \n\nMy friend and I were greeted promptly at the door and we asked to grab a few seats at the bar since we were in a rush...no problem. The bartender was sweet and chatty and recommend a few menu items that could be made quickly....for an appetizer pimento cheese fritters after all how could you go wrong with fried cheese. Here is an interesting tidbit they use cream cheese to make their pimento cheese here for those of you who don't know its traditionally a mix of mayo, shredded cheese, and pimentos. Well to be honest they were a bit disappointing I was waiting for that crisp fried shell and hot gooey cheese - these were just luke warm the tomato sauce on the side was boring and didn't compliment the cheese at all....next up a huge bowl of Gumbo and I mean huge - I really liked the Gumbo my friend and I shared the bowl believe me its enough to share...I thought it was spicy and delicious. \n\nIf your in need of a quick meal I would definitely recommend Hotel Charlotte they also had a great selection of beers."
"3","Here are the facts:\n\n1) Husband goes through button down shirts faster than I go through a pan of brownies (well, not really, but close)\n2) I don't really like to iron, nor do I do it well, ditto husband\n3) Jos A Bank runs more sales than any store imaginable.\n\nConsidering these three facts, it's understandable that I find myself in Jos A Bank once every quarter or so to pick up some button downs for dear husband. The shirts are nice - especially the Traveler's Collection - no iron required! They also have a solid variety of suits, accessories, sweaters, etc. A few points to note for shoppers...\n\n-Sales folks *can* be pushy and a bit overbearing. This completely depends on the day and the person helping you. Sometimes I've had to politely ask for some time and space to just look around a bit. \n\n-It seems like they have a fire sale every week. You can catch these over hyped promotions on the radio and on local cable. I'm still waiting for the moment where the commercial says \""Buy one sweater, get the entire store for FREE!\""\n\nSo, I will continue to go here because hubs likes some of the wares, it can be affordable with the right sale and it's easy."
"3","I came here to get my Global Knives and I left with a recipe book, a cutting board, crystal decanter (gem!), and a oil fragrance dispenser.  They have almost everything you could ever want.  I am extremely happy with my knives and will be coming back for more.  Only down-side is that everything is crazy expensive."
"5","I have to say that the ambiance itself makes this one of the most pleasurable grocery shopping experiences I have ever had. \n\nIt reminds my wife and I so much of shopping in that little grocery you saw Cameron Diaz shopping in while she was in England in THE HOLIDAY. And the music is just so relaxing. The various aromas combine to make an extremely pleasurable experience. \n\nAnd you have to love the candy aisle. All the old timey jars and various candy that you remember from when you were a kid. \n\nThe bread is fresh, the bakery has extremely wonderful things and even the flowers that I bring home as often as I can seem to last a little longer than they do from other places. \n\nBut this is the only location that seems to have this feel so I will continue to shop only in the store on Providence Road."
"2","Food was OK (food temps could be hotter). Clean restaurant. Upholstery was outdated. Service was slowwwwww! There was very few people eating here and only one waitress and what could of been a 30 min experience turned into an hour because of her slow response time. I would come back only if the service was quicker (Which is customary for a Chinese restaurant) and my rice and music soup was hotter!"
"2","not sure whats going on,, the place seems very tattered now,  and the food quality has seem to gone way down,, Michael is doing his best I know but sometimes you need to step back and figure out whats wrong :("
"2","I feel like the quality of this place has gone downhill slightly over the years. More globbed on sauces and general blandness. Meh."
"4","Customer service!  Someone still has it this day in age!  After waiting for several minutes for someone to help me over at Dillard's, I simply gave up, walked into Nordstrom, and purchased the same pair of shoes in no time flat!  To the employee who helped me:  Hats off to you good sir!"
"3","It is alright.\n\nOrdered a chicken pita sandwich. The pita bread itself was good, wished more of the cucumber sauce, and the chicken was thick and enough - to make your money's worth. Just needed something else to give it a 4 or 5.\n\nOf course there are plenty of other options to go to, if not feeling for chicken pita sandwich."
"3","I wanted to love this place, really love this place, but it just wouldn't let me. There was something off, not too bad, but just off. People were nice, food was as good as other Italian places (except Portofino's of course). The service was good, the line wasn't too long. Anyway,it's in a nice spot, around the corner from Williams and Sonoma. So a little shopping and a little dinner. Maybe more shopping than dinner."
"2","Made reservation a day in advance; they didn't have our table, only option was to sit outside.  Are you kidding me?  Anyway, took the table;  service was extremely slow.  Took them a while for the server to come take the order.  Bread was served after repeated requests; sides were served COLD, when asked, they were served reheated not fresh.  PRICEY by any standard, it's not New York.. \nTheir lucky day, my wife and daughter loved their food and Tiramisu - 2 stars.  Yay!!!!"
"3","It seems that we've been on a whirlwind tour of Dairy Queen locations recently, and this is no exception.  While the Plaza Midwood store looks like it might be one of the originals, and the - possibly closed - counter in Eastland Mall probably opened not too longer after, this Cotswald outlet is of the newer variety, and as such, makes me wonder if it will be more like the similar style that's near Wal-Mart on Albemarle Road (a bad experience all around).\n\nFor whatever reason, I have to say that it wasn't - the staff is generally quite nice, and service is good.  The only downside to the whole thing is that the store doesn't have much seating inside, so you should typically prepare to get your goodies to go."
"2","Admittedly I have a bit of a weak-stomach especially when it comes to my olfactory sensory system. I honestly had a hard time visiting this grocery store and as embarrassing as it is to admit, I  actually had to jump ship at the end. \n\nThat being said, they have  fabulous aloe juice ranging from $1.99-2.99 for a large bottle ( $2.99 is the price for a small bottle at Common Mkt/Trader Joe's). They have everything you could possibly need or want for Asian cooking. My boyfriend marveled at the cost of the shrimp (much cheaper than HT). I had the hardest time with the meat dept because of the scent combined with looking at pig intestine started to make me gag a bit...but if you aren't a big baby like me check it out!"
"4","Avoid the pot holes when getting here. There's an entrance that you can try to avoid, that is closer to the stores.\n\nSelections - they have a somewhat of an abundance of different ethnic foods (Vietnamese - plenty, Chinese, Thai, Philippines, Korean...).  The prices here are a lot cheaper than what you can find compared to other Asian grocery stores. When I do come here, I try to load up a lot of Vietnamese produce, fresh shrimp, rice paper rolls, vermicelli noodles, bag of rice.. Because, it is just cheaper!  I kind of wish the quality of the meat is a tad bit better.. Love how they have Vietnamese pre-packaged desserts and food snacks :)\n\nPrice - as mentioned, decently priced. Not as great of a price like in Houston TX and or DC.\n\nService - at the seafood place, great! The cashiers on the other hand, not nice.."
"4","Pooool! Not a bad place. Last time I came to this University area pool hall, it was completely full with smoke. Now, since the ban on smoking has went through I throughly enjoy it a lot more. I came here on a weekday, and there was basically no one here. I played a couple games, I believe they were pretty cheap ($5 an hour?) I can't be so sure because someone else payed for it.\n\nI highly recommend to come play here if you have the free time and you like billiards!"
"2","Must be a good place at night. The espresso was collecting a social security check."
"2","I would given Jackson Java 5 stars 2 months ago, but today I'm only giving 2 stars purely on their coffee.  Great selection of coffee and can't go wrong with Noel.  \n\nLately there has been an influx in some great staff members leaving and a very large rotation of new people.  I really enjoyed going somewhere where the staff already knew what I wanted.  Now I can't even count on the place being open.  Showed up one morning and they weren't even open.  I really hope they can pull it together."
"3","So in my search to create a Japanese Steakhouse list, we stopped into Kabuto last night in the University Area. Sushi bar up front and the cook-tops in the back. It was a slow night, so I was curious to see the quality of the staff. Typical menu of soup, salad, rice, veggies, noodles and choice of meat around $18 for single, and $21 for combo. \n\nWhen we arrived, the soup came out just as we sat down, then the waitress took our drink order. A little odd and rushed, but I moved on and enjoyed the soup. Next was the salad which came with a choice of ginger dressing or ranch. Unfortunately, it seemed like the salad w/dressing was sitting around for pre-made with dressing on top. Ginger dressing was chunky and watery...had one bite and set it to the side. \n\nNext came the rice and veggies. To my surprise, the chef cooked everything at once and it wasn't done with the same excitement and precision as other steakhouses I've been to. After the rice, veggies and meat came the noodles...all piled on the same plate. I prefer the rice to be in a separate bowl, but well. \n\nOverall...just OK. The chef was OK and the food was OK...gots of leftovers as always. They also get you in and out in less than an hour...some might feel rushed, but it felt OK to me as I wasn't able to eat that much because I didn't have a break in between the cooking of other items...it was all piled on."
"3","My sister took us to lunch here yesterday, Friday 4/23.  On our way to AC, she mentioned that she and her coworkers have lunched here on several occasions, and her favorite is the chicken pita with tzadziki sauce and a side salad.  I asked if it was called chicken shawarma, and she replied no, so I gathered that she was speaking of grilled chicken pita with tzatziki sauce with the usual salad stuffing (lettuce, tomatoes, pickle).  We arrived and found a couple of people waiting to order, as well as a few waiting for their take-out orders.  I spied an elderly couple cooking in the kitchen, and I assumed their son or a relative was manning the counter and register.  Based on the food I had here, I'd readily give 4 stars, but long wait times, which could've been easily rectified by adding another cook (or two) plus another person to help the slow order-taker/cashier/server/busser, warrant 2 stars or even less!\n\nSister ordered two #31's (marinated chicken breast sandwich; $5.50) and two Greek side salads ($1.95 each).  All sandwiches come with tomato, onions, and lettuce with tzadziki sauce and wrapped in a grilled pita.  I ordered the Greek gyro salad ($6.95), minus the cucumbers and salad dressing, but add more feta crumbles, please.  (I've included photos of a sandwich.)\n\nI wish I could remark on the chicken sandwiches, but sadly for me, the tzatziki sauce was all over them.  They looked scrumptious, though!  My sis said that AC's cucumber sauce is the best she's ever tried.  Mom says she's had better- we've eaten at many mediterranean restaurants over the years.  I LOVED the gyro!  Awesome grill tan, and the flavors were spectacular, not in the least bit greasy, and I looked forward to and relished every bite!  The salad bed on which the gyro was resting on was equally tasty, even though the dressing, which I had requested to be omitted, was included; It added the perfect tang and spices to the dish- definitely worth a few hours of discomfort.  Really liked the salty feta.  \n\nI'd definitely return on my next visit to the Queen City... I'd go back in a heartbeat on this visit if there weren't so many other places I'd like to check out (and yelp about) first!\n\nOne small complaint- the kitchen had run out of \""yellow\"" rice, which I assumed to be seasoned with saffron.  Shame, since I love saffron rice, and it would've been nice to try their version of it.  Funny that the kitchen staff was lacking on a Friday during lunch hours (we ordered at 1pm and received our food 25 minutes later), was already short on pantry items, and it wasn't busy at all.  No wonder Eric K. left before ordering any food..."
"2","Meh is the only way to describe my experience here yesterday. As other reviews have noted, definitely family owned. Now I don't know about anyone else, but I usually get excited when I hear family owned. It is usually a great welcoming, friendly, comforting experience. This visit was anything but.\nWalked in, about 5 tables were full, we stepped up to the counter to place our order. The one guy working was refilling another tables drinks, and didn't even look up, acknowledged our presence, or anything. A \""hey guys, i'll be right with you\"" would have been sufficient. \nHe makes his way up to the counter and just stands in front of us waiting for us to order, no hello, no how ya doin today. Just a blank unfriendly stare. \nI tried to order the #15, the koobideh. He slowly looked at the menu, then back to me, and just says  \""that takes a long time\"". Ok......I wasn't in a rush, but felt like he was pushing me to order something else, out of frustration I ordered a burger. I was excited to try something new and this experience left me never to try Greek food again if this is how the \""family owned\"" restaurants are run. \nWife had been here before, many years ago while a student at UNCC, and she commented on how downhill the place has gone over  the years. Service and food wise. Very, very,  dry falafel. Too bad,  I was looking for a good, new, dining experience. Should have just gone to Amalfis."
"4","We went to Hanaya Garden today for lunch.  You walk in (past the jewelry, sword, and lucky bamboo sale displays?), order at the counter, and then pick up your entrees once their done.  \n\nWe tried the teriyaki chicken and hibachi shrimp.  Both were made to order, flavorful, came with rice and veggies, and included a side of shrimp sauce for dipping.  Although the entrees were $5.95 and $7.95 respectively, their drinks were cheap ($1.25 with refills) and you don't have to leave a tip because it's self-serve once you order and pick-up your meal.  \n\nWe sat by the makeshift waterfall (I guess that's where the \""garden\"" comes in), watched a little of the news on their big screen TV, and wondered whether anyone ever bought any jewelry, swords, or lucky bamboo.  You wouldn't know that it's a retail shop, too, until you walk in; there's nothing outside advertising it.  \n\nSure, it's not high-class Japanese food, but it was fresh made and was enjoyable for a quick lunch."
"2","Coming from Santa Cruz, I was sorely disappointed with Monterrey. I ordered the lunch special #4 (taco, chile relleno, beans, and rice) and there was nothing special about it. The bean were mush. I've had canned beans with more texture and better flavor. The rice was salty. The chile relleno was profoundly sub-par having very little chile to it. I also couldn't tell if it had been fried or not. The sauce that went with it was okay, but not close to the chile relleno at Las Palmas in Santa Cruz. The taco looked like it needed a lot of love. The meat was oddly seasoned and had gross, mushy texture to it. The taco shell itself was probably store bought. Ick.\n\nOverall, if I do go back I'm trying something else."
"4","This was one of the very first places that I was introduced to upon moving to Charlotte, and it quickly became a staple in my life. There are so many great memories tied to this place and gotta love mariachi night! Yeah, the parking lot stinks, but why does it matter where you park once you get inside and get filled with delicious chips, salsa, queso, and, my personal favorite, pollo fundido. So much food for your money, and great, personable service too."
"1","I came here to check out a New Mexican spot I was seated quickly but it took a while for the server to take my order. I ordered the supreme nacho special and made it vegetarian by taking off the chorizo. I thought it came with refried beans but it came with black beans instead I asked my server kindly if she could put refried beans on top of my nachos she acted like she didn't understand and for what I presumed was the manager I apologized about misreading the menu asked him the same thing he had an un pleasant demeanor the server brought out the refried beans the server never checked back on me during my meal the nachos were good but the service was poor. And on top of all that they rang me up for the wrong price..."
"2","Dim Sum is not good at all.  This restaurant is better than Dim Sum on Central.  That is not really saying much.  The dishes seem frozen and not fresh.  The dim sum was bland and not much variety.  I do not expect Charlotte to have the quality dim sum of large cities.  However, I do expect the staple dim sums such as chicken feet, shrimp rice noodles and other to be at least good.  However, they are not.  Recommendations for dim sum is to drive to Atlanta."
"4","We stopped based on other reviews on Yelp.  While it is not fine dining, the food was hot and tasty.  I can't wait to try breakfast.  The staff makes the place.  They are polite, caring people taking great care of their customers."
"2","4.5 stars????  If you like Denny's, they have a similar breakfast but the bathrooms and decor are horrifying.  No doubt the people are nice but nothing especially good about the food to give such a high rating.  Asked for sugar free syrup for pancakes, no dice.  Coffee is as pain as can be...and no urgency to refill by staff.  I use yelp to determine a true score.  In my opinion Deno has been posting all of his own reviews because no-one would rate this Resturant anything above a 3. I a person rated above this place above a 3, they probable don't use Yelp.  Sorry Deno but put some money into your Resturant because cheep only goes so far!"
"4","If you are in the mood for old school ribs, this is the place to be. Everything is original there. Everything. Well, minus the TVs, which are on the Carolina News channel and not blaringly loud. Everything is quite tasty, but the hush puppies are crazy good. The sweet tea is sugar coma inducing and one of my favorites in the Queen City. You do not leave hungry. I ate all the ribs on my plate, the hush puppies, and a half gallon of tea. I took home the chicken and fries for another filling meal at a later date. It's a shame the place is such a drive for me. Will be back."
"4","I would have given this Marshall's 5 stars however I felt like the clothes department was fairly small...\n\nBut the home section is great!"
"4","All I can say is that it's the Disneyland of beauty supplies....Or maybe Mall of America...."
"1","I hate to leave a negative review because I love getting hair here but I realized today they're ripping people off. I bought hair and it was $99 on the price sticker. When I got home I noticed the sticker had been placed over another. I peeled back the sticker and the other price was $45 and they tried to sharpie through it. Over a 50% markup?!?! I believe I'll start shopping elsewhere!"
"1","This place is straight up ghetto! Parking is horrible, cracks and bumps everywhere. Homeless people on the corners asking for money. Stores are smelly and cold and dirty and old and creepy looking. This is not even close to a mall. Nearly half empty. \n\nLove the bahn mi shop inside (the best sandwiches ever!) Love the fresh steamed pork buns and other baked goods!),..love the varity and prices of products..worth the drive out there...\n\nPho restaurants are nasty,..as in the decor (covered in thick thick dust), ceilings have stains, dark and just make me loose my appetite. How can this place be opened? Imagine the kitchen..inspectors need to shut this strip down and remodel and update!!! \n\nThe store that sells kitchen ware has good selection and prices. Shop owners and workers are shady...they follow you around and stalk and stare you down as you in walk and browse around the aisles to make sure you don't steal anything!"
"3","I'm not a big fan of this area of town anymore. Regardless, this is the closest Office Max to my workplace and I was in desperate need of labels. You can tell the building is old and it really feels that way when you walk in. They are in serious need of revamping or relocating. I was greeted within a few seconds of walking in the door. I normally enjoy a decent greeting and check-in sometime during my visit, however I was greeted 7 times in the span of 5 minutes. I'm pretty sure a couple people asked me if I was finding everything twice. Were they even paying attention to who they were asking?\n\nAfter finding the labels I needed, I realized Sharpies were necessary. While perusing the extensive Sharpie selection, I took a phone call from my husband. While clearly talking on the phone, I was interrupted 3 more times by people that had already asked me if i was finding everything ok. I am all for customer service, but this was far beyond normal customer service. \n\nOverly aggressive customer service folks aside, the store had the selection I needed and overall, my goal was accomplished. Ironically, the cashier did *not* ask me if I found everything I needed. So odd."
"1","This was my first experience at a dive sushi bar.  I saw the parking lot was full, which is normally a good sign.  All the cars were for the gym next door.  There were a group of sorority girls for me to look at, but otherwise shotty decor.  Bathroom was nasty.  Miso soup was edible but the rice in my main dish tasted like it was a few days old.  I didn't try the sushi, there are other places similar but better very close by."
"2","OK sushi. Tried it several times. When I'm shopping at Home Depot, Target or Pet Smart. I get a thing for sushi and cold Japanese beer. Conveniently located in the same parking lot of Home Depot. Every time, disappointed."
"4","I think Ishi is an unnoticed gem in the Charlotte sushi scene; I go there a lot and the food is always of consistent quality and they have a BIG variety of rolls. They're also one of the few restaurant in Charlotte that serves simple but quality hibachi entrees at fair prices, and fast!\n\nI have to rave about their sushi because Ishi does not come off as a fancy, high-end sushi bar, but their rolls are fantastic! They must have a good chef because the special rolls are well put together and delicious, plus they are always tightly packed with perfectly cooked rice. Cold ingredients are cold and fried rolls have just the right amount of tempura. ALSO the presentation is great, the plates are always beautifully arranged and decorated! If you get hibachi, the shrimp sauce is not too runny and the meat is cooked to order and cut into small pieces rather than huge chunks. The meat and vegetables always taste fresh.\n\nTheir prices are extremely fair--maybe even a little low--for the quality and quantity of food they serve. The building they're in now seems a little too big for them and is poorly decorated; but like I said, this is not a high-end Asian steakhouse so maybe you should expect as much. The facility is usually pretty clean and the booths/tables are in good repair.\n\nMy only complaint is that the service is generally AWFUL. Their servers are obviously untrained and can get very obnoxious; when they hand you the menus (which, by the way, are paper ad sometimes re-used a few too many times before they are tossed) they expect you to know what you want right away, then come back too soon and repeatedly to nag you about your order. Usually the food is ready promptly, but once I waited 40 minutes for a simple sushi order while my boyfriend's hibachi meal arrived quickly--he was done eating before my food even got there. A few of the employees are very friendly, but most of them don't seem to care about the customers at all and it shows.\n\nSo: great food, lots of variety in the sushi, but get it to go if you don't want to deal with the shitty waiters!"
"3","Japanese that isn't cooked in front of you...it's pretty good but that's it. Nothing spectacular. I prefer the cook in front of you places. Take out portions are larger than if you are eating in. \nAfter eating here for the past 9 years I had never tried their sushi. My coworker wanted to go and so I decided to give it a try. Sushi was great! Many rolls to choose from and you can customize. The Green Mountain roll does it for me. Spicy tuna (my fav) and avocado on top. Yes!! \nPeople are always nice and friendly too, esp the sushi maker (??) girl. Sometimes the music they play is oddly depressing though. \nAlso need to update the inside. Booths are worn out and the server station in middle of rest looks sketchy."
"2","Wow did this place suck. I came here for lunch with a work collesfur. I am from out of town but this was the closest place and it did nothing for me. Dirty interior, poor service. I just got a chicken salad and it was not memorable."
"1","If I could rate them 0 stars I would. Called to schedule my cab an hour early because I was taking the bus to the pickup location. I got to the pickup location 10 minutes early and and waited. 15 minutes after the scheduled pickup time I still have no cab. I called and they said that there were no cabs available and they would let the dispatcher know that I've been waiting. An hour passes and I still have no cab. Called again and they said still no cabs available. TWO HOURS after my pickup time I still have no cab and was told they still didnt have a driver available. I called Diamond cab and they had a cab to me within 5 minutes. Avoid these guys at all costs. Thanks Diamond cab."
"1","Course is in terrible condition - would not go back nor recommend anyone play this course - not worth playing for free"
"1","Customer beware; I have just learned one of the most rip off and stupid rule that Bank of America is using for crediting refund. On 3/16 I used my debit card to pay for my prescriptions. I knew before hand that it was going to cost quite a bit of money. The clerk charged my account for 1,200 dollars which was the mistake. She immediately electronically refunded the money to my account. I did not pay any attention to my balance thinking that the refund would went back in to my account immediately. This morning 3/19 I received an alert telling me that my fund is below my set limit. I immediately logged into my account ; I found the charge and did not see the credit. I called Boca customer service she told me it is their rule that the refund would not be credit back for 5 days. I complained that they took my fund immediately but yet 15 minutes after noticed the mistake the credit was made; I have to wait for 5 days it does not make sense. \""Well this is the rule. \""; she replied. You be the judge is this a rip off practice and a stupid rule or what?"
"4","Wooooo. What's Charlotte without huge warehouses full of stuff to buy? I come here sometimes with my parents when they decide to come strolling around after a Sunday Brunch or shopping. This Costco store is not the usual one I go to (I go to the other one in Matthews). The reason why I don't like this Costco is because 1. it's super far compared to where I live, and 2. The service here isn't that great because everyone here is a little more let's say \""upper class.\""\n\nBut, other than that, Costco always delivers... on everything. Electronics, food (tons of food), dried food, candy, pharmacy, pills, and whatever your heart desires this place probably has it. Note, when you shop here, the goal is to shop everything in bulk because they don't have that many choices like Wally World and other Grocery stores. Unless, you're buying something expensive like a television or a safe (did you know on their website they sell coffins?!)\n\nA good tip here is that whatever you grab just account it as $10. It usually ends up that every item averages around to $10 for usual shopping and it's a lot easier to keep up with how much you're going to spend. So when you get up to the cashier, you'll have an estimate in your head on how much you're about to drop for the week's grocery, in my case several weeks.\n\nIf you do get the chance, apply for their American Express card. Note, I applied here but the service was so bad I was supposed to be under my parent's account they made a totally new account for me. Which then I had to go to my normal Costco to fix, which completely did. \n\nSo, all in all, keep your eye out for those coupons and watch out for their customer service is probably the only two suggestions I can make about this Costco. And lastly, go crazy with bulk!"
"4","My boss and I go here every week. This place is clean fast and consistent they know us by name... \n\nBeyond that, they have the best club sandwich in Charlotte."
"3","Whoa, look at all those drums! The space really opens up as soon as you walk in the drum department. They even have a lamp rotating different colors on their mountain of drum sets...gives off the concert feel, I guess. \n\nIf you are into drums, you can be set free to play on every set they have as long as it's 5 minutes if others are waiting, which when I went there wasn't anyone around so my husband could play to his heart's content. There are lots of bongos and other instruments too so if your kid is at that age that he or she needs to pick an instrument, take them here to have them try them all out. Seriously, it's better than a hands on museum!!\n\nI also checked out the violin section. Decent prices, especially if you are shopping for a used one. \n\nLike others mentioned, customer service is lacking. I spent the first 30 minutes hanging out without any acknowledgement, however, when all you want to do is play, you don't need anyone interrupting. \n\nOthers said their stuff is more expensive than competitors, but they have signs all over the place saying, \""The guaranteed lowest price!\"" Also, they may have concerts or something every once and a while since the middle of the showroom has a giant stage with rows of seats facing it."
"4","My husband is a professional Bass player and he gets everything he needs from Sam Ash. Today, we traveled 2 hours (from Asheville NC) to come here. We like this place! Decent customer service and they are willing to match prices!"
"3","This is a good local bar.  The wings were average and they had a good beer special with 3 dollar Coronas on Wednesday."
"4","I have always passed my this place and had never stopped in until and ex was wanted to try them and boy was i glad we did. As you walk in you are taken away from the hustle and bustle of being on South Blvd, and is kinda taken to a different place. The decor is very nice and upscale. I must admit they were a little pricey but in my opinion they were will worth it, The portions are huge and they are enough to feed two people. The staff is amazing and are willing to go the extra mile to make sure your happy and that everything is going great. The night we went the owner was there and offered free drinks and I'm down for a free drink anytime.. lol but over all i would rate this a 4 out of 5"
"4","I'm a total fan of the lunch buffet at Villa Antonio! For $9 you get a great meal and of course as much as you want because it's a buffet. One of the best lunch buffets I've been to for a quick lunch during the work day. They have baked chicken, roasted vegetables, salad, mashed potatos, cheese ravioli, and other Italian specialities. You really get your money's worth and more for lunch!"
"2","A very tight parking lot for this Walgreens and I would seriously recommend that you monitor your surroundings when you're going from the store to your car. It is a very tight parking lot.\n\nI didn't go in on this particular visit - we used the drive-through and had a great clerk taking care of our prescription. Top notch and just for her, she gets a star. Otherwise it would have been a one star visit."
"3","The hotel was ok with pleasant staff.  Just stayed one night as we had an early flight.  Our room was average overall and was clean.  I would recommend the North location as it is closer to the airport if you are taking a flight."
"1","Hotel and room were fine but I was very disappointed that they wouldn't let the shuttle take us to or pick us at the light rail station. The other hotels in the area had their shuttles running without trouble. Probably won't stay here again."
"3","We stayed here the night before my girlfriend's flight and didn't really know what to expect.  We were pleasantly surprised that it was a pretty good business hotel!  I'll list the good and bad separately.\n\nGood:  The sheets were clean, the room was clean, the water was hot, the amenities were good for the price point and the beds were fairly comfortable.  Wifi was easy to connect to and signal was strong.\n\nBad:  We saw dozens of dogs in this hotel...I know people love their pets, but allowing pets in a hotel without proper fogging is just asking for flea problems, especially since most people let their pets on the bed.  Fortunately, we didn't have any problems with fleas. We DID have a problem with the night staff, though.  The clerk was nice enough, but the second lady (who did the cleaning, I suppose) has a SERIOUS attitude problem.  She was very rude to my Chinese girlfriend, who doesn't always pick up rapid English when it's not spoken directly to her.  We also heard this unpleasant woman tell our neighboring room that \""YOU DO NOT TELL ME TO GET YOU ANYTHING.  YOU TELL THE FRONT DESK AND SHE TELLS ME TO GET THEM.  THAT IS HOW IT WORKS. \""  All in a loud, echoing voice.  \n\nI suppose the breakfast was just OK.  Very light on meat and heavy on cheap carbs, but it was enough to get us out of the door in the morning.  We liked this hotel, but might avoid this particular La Quinta because of that lady.  After hours of driving, we want smiles and not rude barking from a staff member that rivals the dogs that bring fleas into the rooms....\n\nAlso of note:  You can reserve a room with a card, but you must ALSO let them put a hold on your card for the full room amount until checkout.  You can pay cash at checkout.  This wasn't explained to us until we were at the counter."
"3","My go to store for all things entertaining!  I was recently let down at the lack of Octoberfest items but that doesn't stop me.  \n\nThere are ballons galore and costumes for days.  No matter what type of party you are throwing you can really go all out with the theme with the help of Party City.\n\nThe stores stay clean and the staff is normally pretty upbeat and happy to help.  Probably b/c they work in a pretty cool environment."
"3","Not the hotel of my choice, but definitely fit the bill for sleeping accommodations. The desk staff was pleasant and very helpful in helping us find food at 9:30pm on a Monday night."
"2","Stayed here while in Charlotte for a meeting.  First impressions were not good.  The desk clerk was busy on the phone taking a reservation and didn't bother to acknowledge me standing there.   \n\nThe lobby and breakfast room are being renovated and are a mess.  The workers had left bottles of water and various equipment in the hallway/stairwell.  Not professional at all.  I passed on the breakfast as I didn't really want to eat it while surrounded by construction debris and dust.\n\nI really wish that their web site had alerted me to the renovations.\n\nThe room was clean, nice sized and in pretty good shape.  The bed was comfortable."
"3","Something hilarious about this Azteca outpost being attached to a slightly retro Day's Inn. Love the weird, ad hoc additions to the architecture - thatched roof beverage station awkwardly built into a corner, odd wood and glass entry hallway made more cramped by the quarter-for-a-bronco-ride thingy. \n\nEverything here is slightly more compressed than the Matthews location - booths narrower, tables closer. Service more harried because they do a LOT more business here - even at a slightly off time for dinner, the place was hoppin'. \n\nI could be imagining things, but I feel like prices were 50 cents higher than the other location, hmm. Servings were a tad smaller, for sure, but you don't need to finish that arm-sized burrito, anyway. \n\nOnto the food: I got the Macho Burrito, he got the usual (fajitas). Now, I've had the Macho at Don Pedro, the other Azteca location, and here - it's a nopales burrito, so it's full of pickled cactus. This was by far the best version I'd had - because the jalapenos were fresh, so it wasn't almost too salty to eat (which, admittedly, has never stopped me from ordering it before). Goooood. A mild, almost mozzarella queso was used instead of the monterey jack I'm used to, continuing the low-sodium thing (except for the nopales). Awesome.\n\nFajitas were, well, Azteca Fajitas - smothered in sweet teriyaki-style flavors. Weird.\n\nI'd come back if I were in the nabe and had a serious burrito craving, but I'd probably be thinking about the taco trucks and taquerias down the street the whole time."
"4","The arroz pon collo was a great dish! The plates full of chicken and veggies to fill you up! Make sure to ask for the soft shells to go with it!"
"2","So I have to update my previous review from a 4 to a 2 and echo what a lot of other reviewers are experiencing - what the hell happened, Azteca?  While they have updated and spruced up the interior, quite honestly the food is not as good as it used to be and the newer staff needs some more training.\n\nI know I am a fatty, but if I come in at 11:30 am, I expect lunch portions and lunch prices.  On a Thursday visit, I did get an extra flauta (I thought the menu changed, I didn't realize the waitress had done a dinner order), however that was not a good thing.  The flautas used to be crispy with well flavored meat.  The shell for mine was mushy instead of crunchy and the beef was dry, tough and flavorless.  For $7.25 I would have been irritated enough - for $10, I was kind of pissed.  The rice and beans are the same eh, fine, they have always been, cheese dip was good.  The chips tasted different and not in a good way.  I don't eat the salsa, so I can't speak to that.\n\nI did see a several people that have been there forever, but I did see a lot of new faces too.  From the other \""meh\"" reviews and my past two experiences, I do believe I will be heading to 1900 for Mexican lunches and Monterrey for dinner - Azteca just isn't cutting it anymore."
"1","I have to move on a Saturday. So I schedule to pick up the truck (26ft.) at 7am two weeks in a advance. I get a call on the way down to this office saying they didn't have the truck I request but they could give me a 14ft!\nNow I had a team of movers at my house waiting on a truck to load, so I had no choice but to take it. I wasn't given any sort of discount or any real apology. It was a situation of if I wanted it I had to pay full price otherwise it was going to someone else.\nOn top of all that and having to make numerous trips with the smaller truck, I had to wait almost 40min to give the truck back! \nNot worth the hassle. Go with a different company!...or at least a different location."
"4","Maybe I prefer my clothes a little more urban than the average white guy but, I liked this spot and love the idea of being able to look fly on a budget.\n\nIts HUGE!  Lots of variety.  Urban wear to suits and everything in between.  Accessories too.  My only complaint is that there wasn't much service outside of the fitting rooms.  But at these prices, that was expected."
"5","This place totally gets customer service!  Awesome experience - my car was rear ended last spring and my insurance company recommended Keffer Collision.  It was a great experience - J.Q. was terrific in insuring everything was done to my satisfaction and kept me totally up to date on the status.  My daughter then had an accident with the car a few months later and I took it to them again.  Same great experience. When the car was ready, it was cleaned and spotless.  Great service!"
"5","Fresh tasty North Carolina style barbecue. Good sweet tea as well. Only thing missing was honey which is tastes great with hush puppies. But when I paid my tab met Steve Spoon introduced himself. Very friendly guy. He is the grandson of Bill who started the business. He said next time just ask him and he will give me some. He showed me they have honey behind the counter. I'd recommend this place any day to barbecue lovers."
"2","This is below average carolina barbeque. I made a special trip for a quick lunch and was very disappointed. The pork lacked flavor, the slaw was yellow from mustard, and the fries were food supply sourced. I had hoped for much better."
"1","One of the worst BBQ I've ever had! Old and very dry! Service was okay. Wouldnt go back if you payed me $100!"
"3","I usually take my car to the Wal-Mart Tire and Lube center, but I was in this neighborhood and thought I'd give it a try. The technicians were prompt and efficient, taking my information as soon as I pulled in. They promised a 15 minute turnaround and were pretty darned close. After I paid for it (a little more expensive than Wal-Mart at $30), I noticed that they did a great job vacuuming out the crap from the floors. Good work, I would return."
"1","Please note: i am rating the MINI GOLF COURSE at the Leatherman Golf Learning Center and this review in no way has anything to do with this place as a golf learning institute.\n\nThe highlight of the course was that every hole did in fact have a hole to shoot for and that's how it got at least one star. \n\nRather than talk this out, i may have to bullet point my thoughts:\n-the turfs were torn up\n-none of the water traps were filled with water, although one of the holes was indeed waterlogged \n-one of the lights on the course had been smashed out, with the glass shards still just lying around it\n-some of the hole designs made no sense\n-no windmills or laughing clowns (not a real complaint)\n\nNow, i (just like any other reasonably decent human being) have nothing against making everything handicap accessible, however, when it comes to mini golf, there has to be a better system then simply removing two of the brick pieces from the walls of each hole. i am only assuming that is the reason that every hole had two equidistant holes in the walls. Does it count as a one stroke penalty if your ball goes through the handicap exit? Mini golf courses need walls.\n\ni can imagine that in it's prime, this course was not too shabby, but these days it's nothing but shabby. \n\nHowever, i do recommend the driving range. There is a coupon in the Entertainment Book for a free bucket of balls when you buy one, so that was fun. Not being an actual golfer, i don't know if there is a way to make a driving range bad? Maybe if there was a wall in front of you that sent the balls right back?"
"5","Want to learn how to play golf? This is the place.\n\nI started last summer with the 101 lesson with Chris Leatherman, who is a great instructor for a beginner like me, or people who have been playing casually like some other people in the class.\n\nClasses are very intimate, only 4-8 people per group, and very moderately priced. One-on-one lessons are also available, as well as intermediate and all-women classes.\n\nThe people who work there are laid-back and accommodating. I'm on a first name and joking basis with all of them, as they just tend to put you at ease, give you the occasional tip, or just shoot the breeze. \n\nThe driving range is great. Options range from private booths for both lefties and righties, off the group, and also up on the deck. The chipping range is large, and has a sand pit to practice out of. There are also two large and well-kept putting greens. \n\nEn short, schedule some lessons, grab a bucket of beers and enjoy the range and good conversation. The place is open late with good lighting, in a convenient location."
"4","Excellent prices. Decent food. Nice staff. Clean and friendly."
"3","While your first thought may not be food when you hear Embassy Suites, it ought to be at least your second, especially if you have kids, and even more so if you have kids who can't agree on what they want to eat.\n\nWe have one who likes the big breakfast.  Eggs, bacon, sausage, grits, biscuits, everything he can get his hands on.  Then we have one who likes the not-so-big breakfast, which consists of cereals, breads, fruits and the like.  Note that this doesn't mean he doesn't eat a lot of it.  Just that it's not called the big breakfast in our family.\n\nSo the Embassy Suites holds a special place in our hearts when it comes to food, because both kids are happy when it comes to breakfast.  And they can go back again and again.  Will it win any awards?  Probably not.  But it just fills a need, and it does so really well.  Sometimes, that's all you need."
"3","I have to start out by saying this hotel is very nice, the rooms were nice, location was awesome but....Yes there is a but, the Breakfast Buffy is Terribly handled and you have this huge line only to find out I waited in line for pancakes and did not have too, could have slithered up and asked for them instead of waiting in the omlet lines for 20 mins and the wife ordered an omlet and it was wrong.\n\nLAME LAME LAME setup.\n\nOther than that the Front Desk to the Room were very good.."
"3","I'd never heard of this place. We took the car to the mechanic right next door and had a few hours to kill before the car was ready. Becky and I spotted this restaurant in a nearly-deserted strip mall off Old Pineville.\n\nWe walk in for breakfast and find it to be one of those generic American food breakfast restaurants you find all over town. The sign outside said they only serve breakfast and lunch but we were there for breakfast.\n\nSaturday morning at 10AM and we were the only people in the restaurant. The waitress, whose name was probably Betty Lou or Bobbi Jo (and sounded like it), was the biggest ray of sunshine in the otherwise desolate place. She was very nice and attentive. She engaged in lively conversation and was all peppy and shit. I was kinda hung over so I just wanted by breakfast.\n\nThe only other people there were the Asian owners who were taking down their very Eastern Christmas decorations.\n\nThe menu is your typical American breakfast food fare; pancakes, waffles, grits, biscuits, eggs, all sorts of hog parts and whatnot. I ordered a standard egg, pancake and bacon plate and a sausage biscuit on the site. The food was good, nothing exciting, except for the country ham... which tasted like I'd just popped a gram of salt in my mouth, but Becky likes it.\n\nThe biggest gripe was how long it took for our freakin' food to arrive. It took roughly about 20 minutes for us to get our food. I assumed the Asian man was too busy taking down the Xmas decorations and hadn't even started the pancake batter that morning.\n\nOn our way out there was a funny side on the register that said, \""Do you want to talk to the man in charge, or the woman who knows what is going on\"". That sign alone gave them the third star.\n\nThat's it... pretty generic stuff."
"4","I've been eating at Saigon Palace for about 10 years now. When I worked in the South Park area, I usually went once a week.\n\nThe pho is consistently very very good. I have had many different variations and they have all been wonderful. I can truthfully say that I have never had anything but excellent service and excellent food.\n\nThe owner and her staff are always friendly and nice. If the owner is at the restaurant when I visit, she never fails to speak to me and make sure my meal was good.\n\nAfter a long stint of working at home I am now working in south Charlotte again. I'm glad I can visit one of my favorite restaurants again on a regular basis!"
"5","Pho was very good!! I had Rare Beef. Prices were the same as other places in Charlotte. I would come here again."
"5","Good amount of food and price is decent"
"2","Sleep Poet Antique Mall is big, and they have a lot of different kind of things.  However, the great items and great bargains appear to be few and far between, which is a huge turn-off for me.  Overall, I give it about a 2.5.\n\nYou could spend probably hours here looking at all their wares.  They offer a wide selection of items, from jewelry, furniture, clothes, decorations, records, books, dishes, and other random kitchen items (and much, much more).  The place is filled with little \""booths,\"" which I am assuming is either an attempt to group types of items together or are all owned by one person/business.  It's fairly easy to navigate your way around the store from booth to booth.\n\nOn the weekends, this place is crazy.  People are packed in here, and parking becomes quite difficult.  It is also difficult to find reasonably-priced, good items here.  Because the store is so large, it's quite time-consuming to take the time to find a good bargain.  Most of the wares they offer seem overpriced, with many of them in serious disrepair.  Just because it's \""old\"" does not always mean it's an antique.  \n\nI would probably go check it out again, but definitely not on a weekend.  I am not a fan of large crowds, and this place can definitely get very crowded.  That being said, this a great place for people who long for a good bargain hunt.  If you don't mind a bit of a crowd, and you are the sort of person who loves to wade through things for an awesome bargain, this is probably the place for you.  I'm definitely sad that I am far too impatient for this type of place, because I've seen people walk away with some nice stuff."
"4","This place is huge! The wife and I stopped in this past week. Wow! You could literally spend hours in here (me, I don't have the patience). Plenty of antiques but also lots of western wears and other stuff. It's set up kind of like Black Lion, with lots of little cubicles from different sellers. Just row after row. I kept getting turned around. Of course my wife knew exactly where we were! They have a self serve popcorn machine at the front. Really good popcorn! This is the type of place you can keep coming back and keep finding new (old) things."
"4","Such a unique place! I could spend the entire day wandering around in Sleepy Poet. There are tons of treasures to be found! Grab a free bag of popcorn and peruse all the different booths full of jewelry, vintage clothes furniture, and tons of other knick knacks.  Saturdays are awesome days to stop by. Papi Queso sets up shop in the parking lot and sometimes you'll see a popup coffee vendor and even a cupcake truck."
"5","Let's cut to the chase... this is the best Mexican in Charlotte!\nI started eating here about '92, and back then it was frequent I was the only English-speaking person in the place, and the wait-staff were Spanish-speaking only.  The Decor was terrible, but the food terrific.\nThey've changed it all immensely, and now there's always a good mix of American and Hispanic customers.  The food quality is always, 100% fresh and exceptional, and while the Wait-staff is seldom overly friendly, they're always polite.\nBack in '98 I had the chance to eat at Tacqueria Mexico for dinner one night, got on a plane the next day to Arizona, and late that day was eating on the top of a mountain in Puerta Penasco, Mexico.  I can say with authority the food tasted exactly the same!\nSo, if you're interested in truly authentic Mexican in Charlotte, you owe it to yourself to try this place! As mentioned by other reviewers, it's nothing special to look at, but it's what's inside that counts!"
"3","I can only base my review on the drop-off donation ease only, as I have not actually been into the store.\n\nI am in agreement with Jeff S.'s review in that it is difficult to get in and out of.  South Blvd is a nightmare on a good day and I am usually dropping items off on my way out of work in the evening, so it's a little worse.\n\nThe drive-thru drop-off spot is convenient once you are able to turn into the lot.  I have found the staff to be very friendly, they always come out and assist with whatever I am leaving, be it bags of items or furniture.  The have consistently asked if I would like a receipt as well."
"5","Awesome! Tons of new and used here. CDs, DVDs, bluerays and albums - that have it all. Staff is very friendly."
"2","All the used records here are basically beat up dollar bin records priced at $5 and up. Bad customer service too. Not coming back."
"1","It sucks!!! My room didnt have a trash can! The couch bed was full of springs and cover! But it was roomy and had alot of channels no elevator or handicapped equivalent."
"3","Great place to stop by and check out. My husband and I come here for produce and pine straw. Staff is always friendly. They usually have a large variety of produce. During Apple season I think they had about 15 different types to choose from.  \n\nHillybilly is Located at Margaret Wallace and Independence Blvd. This location can be difficult to get out of on Saturday and during rush hour because the right lane turns into a turning lane for Village Lake Drive."
"4","The Seafarer, like all Southern \""Fish Camps\"", serves up all sorts of seafood and accouterment, with the majority of the items being fried.  The restaurant is owned by the same family that owns South 21 curb service on Independence Blvd, which has been there since you could cross Independence blvd at numerous intersections, even on foot (way long y'all).\n\nThat being said, its quality junk-food at its best.  Its by no means healthy, but its a lot better than any fast food you could put in your body.  The tartar sauce is famous and for good reason...its the best I've ever had and cannot be replicated (the recipe is super secret).  They have two types of cole slaw, either mayo or vinegar based, both of which are delish.\n\nI like to go during the week to beat the crowds, as on the weekend it is out of control (you can tell by the size of their parking lot)."
"4","Some friends and I tried Woodlands tonight and were not disappointed. The food is amazing. The Masala Dosa was delicious and the vada did not disappoint. I would highly recommend this place to anyone who loves indian food and pure vegetarian cuisine!"
"1","The lady at the front desk has an attitude. Food is ok. Not great stuff worthy of a 20 min drive.. bad service. Ok Ok food. I have had buffets here, and they are useless.  There are many restaurants in Charlotte which are waaaay better for the price and service. There are a few things good on the menu - the south indian platter - but not sure if you would like all what is served in it. We had the masala mysore dosa - which was literally floating in OIL and the know-it-all lady said, \""No, this is how it is.\"" \n\nI am from South, I eat dosas for breakfast and dinner and have been eating for 27 years! Are you kidding me? No acknowledgement, nothing. She had to prove that she was right. I am never going back to this restaurant. I also had the gobi manchurian - waay salty and hard as rocks! Really man? Can't even bite into that thing. I have repeatedly given this place a chance, 4 times so far, and never has it been good. Will not go here. Too many options at Charlotte where food is better, cost is lower, service is better."
"1","This place is horrible!\n\nI had placed an order one day and they had messed it up the pizza was soggy and just disgusting to eat. So I called the store was put on hold for a while and never got ahold of anyone so I emailed the survey in and a few days later the management team called me from the store and tried to claim that it was MY fault for the order being messed up and I should of paid more attention to it and this and that. But after a while of going back and forth they credit me a Large one topping pizza. \n\nFast forward....\n\nMy wife and I were lazy and figured we'd use the deal, so I called in placed the order and we waited. After about an hour our pizza guy got here and he hands me the pizza. On top of the box was the receipt and he snatches it off the top and crumbles it up (at this point he still hasn't said one thing to me) he then turns around throws the receipt on the floor in yard and storms the hell off. I mean what the hell. Not sure what his attitude and deal was maybe he hates his job? I don't know. \n\nThe pizza sucked anyways waste of time. And the management is horrible at this place. I'll stick to dominos."
"1","This place is awful and does not meet McDonald's standards by a long shot. Do not stop here. Servic3 is terrible dood is xold and usually comes out wrong."
"3","Oh infamous Waffle House, ubiquitous breakfast place of the south for many a hungover/still drunk patron.\n\nAs far as Waffle Houses go this one was pretty clean and friendly. Food here tastes the same as any other Waffle House I would say mediocre. But you know what? It all tastes so good when you're hungover from a crazy night. Granted I felt a bit sick afterwards from eating so much fatty processed food but we all have to make sacrifices when we are trying to eat and have only found $7 around the house right?\n\nService is friendly, being really close to where I had passed out the night before, cleanliness, and massive amounts of cheap food make this Waffle House a winner in my book. Really what more can you ask for?"
"4","My go to cheap Chinese lunch spot on Harris Blvd.  The price is right.\n\nIts a great cheap lunch special($5-6 with eggroll) but sometimes the free tea tastes a little funky, so I don't drink it a lot of the time.  The chicken is real meat, the sauces aren't too salty and, there plenty of veggies with every dish.\n\nThat said, don't expect to be wowed by some 100% traditional Cantonese or Szechuan food.  This is Americanized Chinese and it gets the 4 stars because of food per $."
"5","I never thought I'd spend more than $10 on a carwash until I stopped at Autobell.  I thought to myself, $25 for a carwash?  Really?  And an automated car wash at that.  I've since changed my tune after having my car washed there many times.  The extra $$ isn't so much about the car wash itself, its the service provided after the car has been washed.  I've never seen a harder working group of people.  Depending on what you get, they will completely towel dry you vehicle, wash the inside of your windows, shine your tires, and wipe down your dashboard with Armor-all.  What I can tell you is this - I've paid $200 to get my car detailed before at Honda.  I've been happier with the $25 car wash at Autobell.  I should have saved myself $175.  That being said, they do have a $4 ride through option that I also used in between the more thorough washes I described.  The $4 ride through is more of what I was initially thinking when I thought the $25 options were over priced.  You don't get any frills.  You sit in your car while it goes through the automated wash cycle - thats it.  No towel dry or any other service.  This is a great option most of the time for me.  Great job Autobell!!!"
"4","Great course. Play was a little slow but overall great place to play. The best course in the university/concord area."
"3","Cheap haircuts, done quickly, especially if you check in using their app. My only complaint is that I never seem to see the same person twice, so there is no way to have someone used to the way you want your hair done."
"2","Ordered pizza and cheese bread tonight arrived 1:20 later with some type of cinnamon sticks. Long wait wrong order. Next time order Joe Mommas or Luigis and pick up my fault for being lazy."
"2","Ok this is a confusing review for me to write. I LOVE the cajun chicken tenders at the Wing King. LOVE THEM, no really I LOVE THEM. I also really enjoy the Ming Wings, very unusual and I'm pretty sure you can't get them anywhere else.\n\nBUT...in the 20 or so times I've been there I can honestly say I've ALWAYS experienced terrible service. Sometimes worse than others, but this is why I now consider Wing King a take-out ONLY place. Waitresses are distance and frequently down-right rude. They are neglectful and act pissy if you ask them for anything. Wing King would probably be way more successful with an entirely new wait staff."
"3","To go was nice and hot when I came in.\nWings were VERY GOOD. The maui wowi and the hot ranch. I don't think I would dine in though. I got a pretty cool extra room setup for parties and everything though"
"5","Easily the best wings in Charlotte. We've come here two nights in a row now and haven't had any problems. Well, tonight my BLT came on Texas toast instead of a bun like I requested but to be honest it doesn't even matter. The food is awesome, the prices are right, and the atmosphere is great. Location is a bit odd but don't let that throw you off. Definitely go, get the wings with the honey gold sauce, have a $1.75 beer and relax."
"4","I loved this place food is good. chicken. Wing delicious whit variety of the flavor we try all  .also good price en beer"
"3","My girlfriends and I stopped in for a quick lunch Saturday and was pleasantly surprised by the food and service from this location.\n\nWe walked in and the place was pretty empty but very clean. We were immediately greeted by Christina who ended up taking our order and giving excellent customer service.\n\nWe were starving and a lot of the newer items on the menu seemed very tempting! Christina went over several items and we settled on the turkey bacon and ranch wrap, fish sandwich and regular roast beef sandwich.\n\nWe waited because they had to prepare everything after we order, but I don't mind waiting for hot food! And Christina brought everything out to us and made sure we had everything we needed to enjoy our meal. \n\nMy friend let me try some of her wrap. It was delicious the ranch dressing has a bit of a kick and it comes with a good amount of turkey, lettuce and tomatoes. \n\nI ordered the fish sandwich was really good, crispy on the outside pretty good with a little ketchup and lettuce. I love the seasoned fries, especially when they are hot and fresh! \n\nI didn't try the roast beef, but from what my friend said it was pretty delicious! \n\nI was pleasantly surprised with how the service was at this location. And hot food is always a winner in my book. So I'm sure to stop in again!"
"3","This will be short and sweet!\n\nThis Walmart is always very busy. Its clean and fully stocked. Cheap prices but every time I go its an experience....I mean it's Walmart so I got exactly what I expected."
"1","I like walmart for their low prices and that is it...their customer service is sub par and eventually I won't shop there at all unless absolutely have to...as far as THIS location (S. Tryon)...I HATE IT. That is all..."
"4","I was surprised to see that DSW is now carrying a bunch of running shoes!  Before it used to be just casual and formal shoes (for men) but I went here the other day and was pleasantly surprised.   Now it's not going to be a specialized as say a Run for your Life or TrySports store, but it was nice to find a store that carried Mizunos or Asics.\n\nNormally I just stick to the right hand side (2 aisles) where the men's shoes are at and the back clearance section.  My sister often goes here... sometimes for hours on end and I can see why since their selection is vastly greater on the women's side."
"3","Chinese food good.I think they should just stick to Chinese food leave asian food alone. Do not Order Hibachi from this place didn't taste like it to me."
"2","Ok food, but this Ohioan wasn't impressed. Clean inside, and nice bathrooms though."
"2","Went here for the advertised prime rib; very poor cut of meat, not to mention poor service.  Either they didn't have enough staff or they were just inept; we had to remind our waitress numerous times for bread, drinks, etc.  We really felt bad for customers next to ours who sat waiting for their food the entire time we were seated.  Lastly, they don't give you a full 1/2 rack of ribs; very limited portion.  It will be a long time before we come back; there are plenty of other options available with better food and service."
"1","This rental community does not offer its residences a recycling drop facility!"
"4","Great subs! I've been going here for years... they cut the meat right in front of you, give you generouis amounts, bread is fresh, and staff is always pretty friendly. It is MUCH better than any subway or quizno's I've been to. Get your subs fully loaded, it is DELICIOUS."
"3","We got the calamari as our appetizer which was good.  The sangria was perfect--we were all happy with it.  I was really disappointed then when the entrees came after the beginning of the meal was so good-I thought the main course would be as well.  Unfortunately, this was not the case.  I got a seafood medley on top of angel hair pasta.  The pasta was stuck together in clumps--I guess they forgot to stir it while it was boiling.  The seafood was ok--the dish was so flavorless.  If my eyes were closed, I would have no idea I was eating scallops, shrimp, etc.  My husband's dish was basically the same as mine.  Flavorless.  Our friends ordered the specials and were really happy with those, so maybe go with the specials if you eat here.  For the amount of money this meal was and how disappointing it was, I would not return."
"2","We missed lunch and stopped ther for just a bite around 2 pm. There was just a few costumers but we were standing at the counter waiting to order for over 10 minutes while a waitress was talking to someone eating at the counter and ignoring us the whole time. I glared at her until she got uncomfortable, said her shift was over and left the restaurant. \n\nThe girl she was talking to turned to be an employee, she finally got up, apologized and took our order.  We sat down and when our order came this other server didn't bring any settings, we actually had to call her back for it. She thought that was funny. I got the impression they only hire high school girls.\n\nThe spanakopita appetizer was actually quite tasty but the portion was way too small, 4 bite sized pies Hey spinach pie is not a luxury item! The grape leafs were run of the mill. No lamb gyro or kabab? Only beef and chicken, I have no use for a beef Gyro. The funny thing is that at the Charlotte cafe right next door they serve lamb Gyro and they don't even claim to be a Greek eatery. \n\nNot convinced"
"2","Used to be a great little joint for a quick salad and bowl of soup. But the past few months the service has become a real problem. Too many teenagers, not enough adults."
"3","We have been coming here off and on ever since this place opened.  We have seen a high turn over in servers over the more recent years and today I understand why. We ordered 2 diet cokes with our meal in to go cups.  We stood at the counter and watched the girl fill our drinks as we thought we would save her the trouble of bringing them to the table.  She filled up the first to go cup with regular coke and put a lemon in it (which, I think, usually goes into a diet coke). So we thought maybe this isn't our order.  We watched as she filled the second to go cup with regular coke and again put a lemon in it. Hummm, surely this must not be our order.  \nShe turned around, we told her we were waiting for 2 diet cokes, and even asked, Are those diet cokes? and she starts to hand them to us.  I told her, we just watched you fill them with regular coke.  She just smiled, never said I'm sorry...or... oh I made a mistake...or... isn't that a funny joke to switch regular coke and diet coke, nothing.  She emptied them out and filled them with diet coke as we watched her.  After we sat down, another waitress came over and was very apologetic but with servers like the one who thinks it's funny to fill orders with coke when diet coke was ordered, we probably will not go back. Good thing I am not a diabetic."
"2","Busy place. Menu has a Mish mash of things, from gyros to lasagne. I had the gyro platter and DH had the gyro and pork kabob platter. First off, the gyro meat reminds me of meatloaf in texture and it was very salty. They put some kind of gravy on it. The Greek salad was good. Fries...well, they're fries. Signs everywhere saying, \""We work for tips.\"" However, aside from bringing the food to the table they really don't do much to earn a tip. In addition, we paid with a card and there wasn't a line for a tip anyway. Overall, tried it once. Will not go again."
"4","This CVS has a nice layout and has friendly employees."
"4","This was my second time here.  Service was great and my water was kept full.  I ordered the special of the day: portabella mushroom ravioli with choice of sauce.  I decided to be demanding and asked for 1/2 alfredo 1/2 marinara.  They put the sauces in bowls and allowed me to sauce it myself.\nMy friends mostly got the special as well, except one person got a greek pizza.  It looked really good.  I enjoyed the ravioli, but my friends weren't too keen on it.\n\nthey have a bar opening soon from what they were saying so Riccio's is expanding."
"5","I tried this restaurant with a friend and I had the spaghetti.  It was delicious.  The waitress was great too.  The prices weren't high either.  All I have to say about this restaurant is positive.  I will be going back for sure and you would be wise to check it out for yourself.  We went around 5:30 p.m. and it was very quiet.\n\nS. Cooper"
"2","My family arrived at this strip mall tex-mex at about 7pm on a Friday night.  Seating was quick and the \""joint was jumping\""  Let me start by saying this is THE LOUDEST RESTAURANT I have ever been in.  After the expansion, I guess they like the acoustics, because there was not a shred of fabric anywhere to absorb the sound.\n\nAppetizers and drinks arrived right away and the simply apps were good (guacamole and cheese dip).  Our orders for entrees were taken at 7:15pm and that was where the wheels came off.\n\nMain course finally arrived at around 8pm and my order was flat-out wrong.  Maybe it isn't such a good idea to have two menu items that sound so much alike (Tacos al Carbon and Tacos al Camarone) in a noisy dining room.  Took an additional 10 minutes to get the right entree while everyone else ate.\n\nFood was generally tasty, but the fixings with the Fajitas and Tacos were lean (no cheese and only enough sour cream etc for 1 tortilla).  My son though the Burrito Fritto (Chimichanga) was amazing, though.\n\nWe did not drink for a change, so that certainly may be \""undiscovered country,\"" but all in all it was a disappointing experience.  A place like this is not really intended for a 100-minute dining experience."
"2","I went for a late lunch - only one other table there.  The rye bread was stale, lean corned beef very dry, fries OK and service very indifferent.  I went out of my way to eat here but will never go back.\n\n I had just been in a deli in the Chicago area....now that was a GREAT CB sandwich and service was very pleasant.  Wish they had a Benny and Max's here in Charlotte."
"3","Finally tried this deli for breakfast this morning. A bit hidden but anyplace that promises bialys (brooklyn bagels) and potato pancakes is worth a try in my book. Not a lot of people for sunday breakfast so we sat right away. Hubby had corned beef and thoroughly enjoyed it! I had an omelet with a bagel.. Gotta say i am a bagel afficionado and this is the best bagel i have had in charlotte! Would go back just for a bagel! If u like NY style delis... i.e. Pastrami and lox... Try it out! Coffee was good too!"
"1","$9 for a sandwich only. It was not worth it."
"3","This Marble Slab Creamery is located in Stonecrest Shopping Center, towards the front of the development near JoJo's, Miro, Dean & Deluca, etc.  It's your standard ice cream shop.  It had a decent variety of flavors, along with some \""Ice Cream Cupcakes\"" that I had never seen before.  Whole ice cream cakes in various sizes were also included in a stand-up freezer.  A few chairs and tables scattered about, but this is located near the plaza with plenty of outdoor seating near the big fountain, should weather permit.  \n\nOn this visit, I decided to get one of the ice cream cupcakes to try later - it was fine.  I purchased a Birthday Cake milkshake along with that, which wasn't blended particularly well, so the first sips were just sweet milk, followed by clumps of ice cream.  Again, fine.  Nothing special.  The employees were nice enough.  I wasn't wowed, but wasn't expecting to be - it was A-OK."
"4","I like Firebirds.  It is was it is.  Nice environment, reasonable food.  Servers are usually pretty good.  Bartenders are always dead on.\nOnly complaint.... PLEASE take your thumb out of my food when delivering it!!!  Use a tray if you have to.\nNew location is beautiful too."
"5","Hands down one of the best restaurants in Charlotte.  Delicious food, yummy drinks, friendly staff."
"3","The good: Monday is half-priced wine night for some types.\n\nThe Meh: Who needs another average \""executive\"" restaurant?  While I wouldn't ward anyone away from Firebirds, I've never walked away saying that I had to return.  While the atmosphere is good, the food is just average and expensive.  Plus, the portion sizes are insane!  No one needs to eat that much!\n\nSmaller portions, lower prices will allow your patrons to live longer and return to eat again.  Or bring a friend and share a meal."
"5","Great atmosphere, friendly welcoming service and most important the food it is delicious!!! I highly recommend it, specially if you are like me, from out of town. Great experience!!!"
"5","Always great food and great experience. We tell our family about it all the time. Our favorite restaurant for sure!"
"1","Once upon a time, a party of 12 of us descended upon Mickey & Mooch to celebrate the birthday of one of our fair maidens.  Based on the restaurant's d\u00e9cor and lavish entrance, I was surprised to open my menu and found that the pricing on items were pretty reasonable, considering.  I had expected entrees to be higher priced.  However, we soon found that \""lower\"" prices come with many consequences.  \n\nDrinks:  After 30 minutes of being seated, some were still waiting for their beverages.  When they finally received their bottles of beer, they were \""as is.\""  No glass.  What kind of \""upscale\"" restaurant serves beer without a glass?  We weren't sitting at the bar; we were in the dining room.  One of the beers was a Blue Moon brought in its bottle.  Don't the bartenders know that Blue Moon is always traditionally served with an orange slice?  It's like serving a lime with a Corona.  Someone else ordered a martini.  It was sloshed around as it was set down in front of him.  He had to wipe up the spillage by himself.  \n\nBread:  Bread was served but it was cold (like it was taken out of a freezer and not fully thawed).  They asked to have the half-frozen bread taken away and replaced with \""warm\"" bread at least twice; it never came during the entire two and a half hours we were there.  \n\nSalads:  We asked if we could get something besides a regular garden salad.  Our server advised a Caesar salad or Wedge in its place.  We were never told that there was a significant upcharge to getting a slightly different salad.  $2.95 for the Caesar, $3.95 for the Wedge..the same cost if you ordered them separately.  When this was brought to the attention of our server at the end of the meal, he brushed it off.  I'm guessing it happens a lot at the restaurant.   The salads arrived & we had to ask for silverware (for the 2nd time).  Several minutes passed and I finally got up and swiped them off an empty table.  Minutes after we had started using the newly acquired silverware and eating our salads, the server finally returned...with ONE set of silverware.  I guess we were supposed to share?\n\nEntrees:  Our entrees arrived halfway through the salads.  After delving into the entrees, several people had puzzled looks on their faces.  Some had ordered their steaks medium rare or medium.  They came out with raw meat in the middle.  And not just a small portion; it was golfball-sized.  Medium rare means pink with some reddish tones; not raw.  Worse, one person ordered pork.  It, too, had a golfball-sized red raw center.  Trichinosis, anyone?  At this point, we called over a manager.  When the raw pork was displayed to her, she tried to tell us that it was \""fat.\""  Red fat?  In the middle of a pork cut?  Being served the raw pork is one thing.  Passing it off as acceptable by a manager is poor crisis management.  All of the undercooked meats were taken away to \""re-cook\"" or replace.  The steaks were returned within a few minutes; the pork wasn't.  With the plates that were taken away for the steaks were the side items that everyone had ordered.  These were not returned on the plates and had to be \""re-ordered\"" by us specifically requesting them from the server and/or manager.   One friend ordered drawn butter with his salmon.  It didn't come until he was halfway through the salmon, about 15 minutes later.  \n\nHalfway through my meal, I finished my glass of wine and ordered another glass.  It didn't come until I was through with my entr\u00e9e and the plate had been cleared.  Great timing...and I'm not a fast eater.   After everyone finished eating and plates were cleared, the \""new\"" pork finally arrived.  \n\nBill:  Did I mention the Wedge salad that was on my bill after everything we went through and it was brought to the attention of the server that we were never advised about the upcharge?  After all our problems, getting the bill with all the additions was like a kick in the head after being punched in the stomach for a couple of hours.  \n\nSummary:  I'm just telling you the story from my side of the table.  I don't even know everything that went on at the other side of the 12-person table.  I only gathered stories here and there.  It wasn't just one error.  It was one after another.  It wasn't just one person at the table.  It was practically everyone who had a problem.  When the numerous errors were brought to their attention, the errors were not handled in an appropriate manner by the waitstaff or the management team.  The biggest problem of the night was that nobody seemed to care whether we had a poor experience or not.  The kicker was that afterwards I wrote a 3-page letter to Mickey & Mooch corporate...and got no response.  They apparently didn't care either.  So I guess they won't care if I take my money elsewhere. \n\nThe End.  Happily Never After."
"4","Great food, good value, huge sides and it was really nice to be casual in a steak house.  We will be there a lot."
"2","Just OK. Better options out there. Seems a little tired....Firebirds has better food and prices."
"5","Dined at Micky and Mooch for the first time two weeks ago. Ordered the filet oscar style with bearnaise over asparagus. Delicious. The seven layer chocolate cake is to die for. Old school ambiance. Live music which makes it a little loud. Very good service. Can't wait to return."
"1","The filet mignon was literally the worst steak I have ever eaten. This is not an exaggeration.  I sent it back and they brought another and I wanted to puke when I tasted it. The side dish of potatoes was inedible. I will not be going back. One gets the impression of very weak management."
"3","Initial problems with a bathroom vanity but they fixed it."
"1","Well, it's a Starbucks...  Same coffee, same general atmosphere, but that is all that's good about this location.  It is about a third the size it needs to be, there is ALWAYS a waiting line and tables are overcrowded and sometimes hard to find.  Forget meeting with any privacy at all.  I felt like I was in the middle of three other conversations!\n\nI DO NOT recommend this location!"
"3","When you actually go into the restaurant it's nice! Nice setting update classy etc etc. it's a nice spot for a simple date night. \n\nNow I usually do the To Go orders so this was my first time actually eating inside the place. The staff is very friendly and nice. They leave you a big bottle of water so that you can help yourself but they take care of your other refreshments. \n\nI got the usual Chicken Parm (I like spicy food so I got them to kick it up a bit) when the food finally came and I started eating it was like eating plain chicken. Even though the chicken was coated and backed and looked seasoned it was just rough. It had no flavor whatsoever. \n\nNow this is confusing because when I usually get the To Go it's usually pretty awesome! But inside the food just didn't hit it for me. It was a complete miss. Even my wife thought her Fettuccine was bland. \n\nI'm not sure what happened but I'm probably going to stick with the To Go orders here.\n\nThe staff was 5 stars but the food was mediocre at best. Maybe they were having an off don't but I just don't know."
"1","BEWARE!!!!\n\nI HAVE BEEN TO BEAUTY BRANDS SPA SERVICES TWICE AND HAVE BEEN OVER CHARGED BOTH TIMES!!!  That's 100% of the time!!!  The first time, my mother-in-law took my daughter to get a haircut, I had called twice- once to check availability and once to book the appointment, and both times I confirmed the price.  When my mother-in-law came back I saw the receipt and saw that they had overcharged us by $10.  I did contact them and they refunded me the $10.\n\nI decided to give them another chance and took my daughter back there to get a manicure a few weeks later, again I confirmed the appointment and price when I called.  We arrived 5 minutes before the her appointment time.  She was checked in, and then we waited.  The staff walked by us numerous times, two of them including the manager, were chatting at the desk behind us most of the time.  Finally, 15 minutes after the appointment was suppose to start, I went back to the desk, to confirm the appointment time.  The manager who had checked my daughter in acted like she had never seen us before.  I confirmed that her appointment was at 1:00pm, she said yes.  When I mentioned that it was now 1:20, she said she would check on things.  My daughter was taken back at 1:25.  When she came out, her nails were completely wet.  She said they didn't have a dryer- kinda surprised since they say they are a spa.  She also had hang nail, that they didn't even clip.  As we were checking out I noticed they had charged me $29 instead of the $17 they had quoted me.  Then the girl checking me out, pulled out their brochure and showed me where it said $29, but the brochure said that was for a pedicure.  I pointed that out to her, and she changed the price back to $17. \n\nWe then went home where my daughter waited 2 hours before doing anything so her nails could dry.  Then at 5pm, ( 3 hours after we left), she went to reach for something and the polish came of the center of her thumb nail!  \n\nI won't be going back.  If they overcharge the same customer twice, it's pretty obvious this is their usual standard of operation."
"2","Livery strong greasy odor all thru dinner"
"3","Lightning fast \""strip-mall\"" style Chinese food.  It's exactly what you expect it to be.  It's a great spot to stop by after work and pick up a quick take-out meal for the family, but I wouldn't expect too much by the way of \""cuisine\"".\n\nHad the beef with broccoli, kung pao chicken, and sweet and sour chicken recently.  All of which were made from picky-eater friendly ingredients, and were a hit with the kids.  I do like the fact that the staff is all Chinese and a few words spoken from the customers in Mandarin seem to go over well.\n\nOverall it's nothing special, but a decent value for a mid-week take home meal."
"4","Wow, something out of this world! Very good southern cajun and creole cooking! The Shrimp and Grits was delicious, The Po'boy out of this world, and even the cajun dip for an appetizer was so good! If you are looking to try something new this is the place to go!"
"4","Love the fish and grits! Best in Charlotte!"
"5","Both the Gator bites, and the gumbo are amazing; I have never been disappointed by the food."
"2","I have been coming here for awhile, and truth be told, the quality is getting worse.\n1st tip: DO NOT EVEN BOTHER with the fried oysters. You will hate yourself for ordering that. The oysters are so tiny, and it's not worth the money. Actually put the gator bites on the do-not-order list as well. They're smaller than the popcorn chicken you get at KFC. \nI normally come here and order the gumbo or she crab soup and make that a meal. A bowl runs you about $8-9, which is a lot more tolerable. Sometimes the gumbo comes out luke warm (at best), but it tastes good enough.\nIf anything, consider this place for a drink, they do have drink specials on the hurricanes and wine and beer. \nI really hate that one of the few cajun places in Charlotte is going downhill."
"2","I was debating whether to give this a 2 or 3, but after reading other reviews, going with the 2 rating as it doesn't seem like they get customer service.\n\nIt started out poorly.  My brother had made a tee time and when he booked it, told the person he had a coupon from the local paper (it was Memorial Day and they were running a special for that day), which they said they'd note on the reservation.  When he checked in (before me), he told the person behind the counter that he had the coupon, and they honored the price.  I checked in about 15 minutes later, and someone new as behind the counter.  I didn't know about the coupon, so I paid for myself and my guest.  My brother came in just after the guy ran the transaction and mentioned the coupon.  At this point, the employee became very difficult.  He told us that he couldn't honor the coupon since I didn't mention it, and it was too late.  He berated us for even suggesting that we ask for a discount after the fact.  My brother told him about telling the person on the phone about it, and how it shouldn't be hard to reverse the transaction especially since the deal was advertised for this day only.  The employee continued to be rude so I just suggested we go play and see if someone else was working when we finished.  As a side note, when we finished, there was someone else and they did give us a $40 refund (value of the coupon) but had to find the owner to do it, which took about 15 minutes.\n\nPace of play was very slow, just over 5 hours (which to me, is painful, I'm used to 4 hour rounds at home and we walk...this was 5+ hours with everyone in carts).  We complained to a ranger a few times, but they said the course was backed up (but it seemed to be just two groups playing slow ahead of us).  \n\nTees were kind of hairy and hard, not well manicured.  The greens were in good shape though, rolled pretty well, fairways weren't too bad.  Nice layout overall, some good holes.  Overall, a pretty easy course.\n\nI didn't use the range, but my brother said the balls were very old and cracked.\n\nWe played a course up in Greenville earlier in the weekend, and it was the same price with better conditions and much better attitude from the staff."
"4","This place looked very popular just from the amount of cars outside in the parking lot.  Inside however, they had plenty of room and sat us right away. \n\nThey have a decent selection of fried/broiled fish along with some other meat selections as well.  (I'm just not one to order a steak at a place thats known for it's fried fish)\n\nThe waiter was extremely friendly and attentive, we were quite pleased.\n\nAll of the food was pretty good, we had the broiled Alaskan Whitefish, Blackend Talipia, popcorn shrimp and the Mac and Cheese.  Everything overall was pretty good.\n\nThis is a great place to take the kids or a group to get your fried fish craving satisfied."
"3","I've eaten in twice, eaten take-out here several times.  The food I can't fault.  It's tasty, even taking it home, and I don't think any fish camp could match it.  Seriously, if you want take out fish, this IS the place, bar none.  \n\nThe reason it loses two stars is the seating inside the restaurant.  One time we went we were put in a smaller dining room and the experience was very pleasant.  Enough room between tables and we could hear each other from across the table.  The other time we ate in the main dining room and HOLY CARP!  You can't hear yourself think!  The tables are stacked one on top of the other, and it makes you think that every person in Fort Mill is hearing impaired, because there's a LOT of shouting and hideously loud talking in that room!  I had such a headache when I left the actual enjoyment of the food had been long lost.  I think I'll stick to take out from now on and save on the Advil!  I've been in crowded fish camps before and NONE of them were as intolerable as the main dining room at Captain Steve's!"
"2","This place needs some cleaning!!!!!! We tried it because of the great reviews , the buffet was gross, the hibachi chicken was not bad, but just eating it in that dirty place wasn't pleasant."
"2","No thanks.  I'm not really even sure how to describe the Barnyard Flea Market.  We drove by several weekends in a row and were astonished by the amount of people this place packs in so we decided to give it a try.  We were hoping to find some small furniture pieces or decor items.  Umm..not here.  Old paint, used shoes, Avon perfume from 1985, push up bras, womens shape wear with cut-out butt cheeks - yes.  Items of real value - no.  It is just a strange conglomeration of junk in my opinion.  \n\nThe booths that did appeal to me were the fruit/veggie stalls featuring many latin american items for a decent price.  That would be worth going for it you were looking for a hard get item like cactus leaves or cactus flowers.  Other than that, not worth the trip."
"2","As one who grew up with regular flea market excursions, and not just because my mom once owned a 5 and Dime, I was pretty underwhelmed by the Barnyard Flea. It's a lot of ... well, junk, and not the \""OHMYGOD, I can't beleeeve they have this\"" kind of junk. Cheap plastic earrings that break on the first wear, sketchy gym shoes, old Avon body products, and a couple of hardware store closeout booths. Even the food is just so-so (sorry, fudge lady), lacking the carnivalesque vibe that usually comes with powdered funnel cake and the like. \nThe two exceptions are the vintage jewelry stall near the office and a Latin produce station, where I saw and bought prickly pears (yaaaayyyy) and which redeemed the 3 and a half hours spent roaming. I knew there HAD to be something good here!"
"4","Being the best pizza in Oregon is about the same prestige as being the best hockey player in Uganda, you don't get alot of bragging rights. The pizza and other menu items are decent , service good and the delivery is fast."
"2","The entire property is run down, kinda creepy and pretty yucky.  I had rented some inline skates thad had moldy inserts.  I think they may be the only roller rink in Madison so you don't have too  many options.\n\nObviously this place is popular with kids and they don't seem to notice all the blight so we would just grin and bear it."
"5","I had a super impressive experience at this Panera yesterday. I ordered the Mac n Cheese. It is so creamy and delicious. Towards the bottom of my bowl there was a small piece of plastic. Sort of like the kind you would find on a freezer bag. I handed to the manager walking by. She did not say much when I gave it to her so at first I was kind of miffed. Then in a few minutes she returned with a cash refund for me. She apologized for what happened and I was happy with her response. What happened next was what really impressed me. A young man came out from behind the counter with a fresh meal for me. Knowing I had eaten most of my food already he brought some to go containers as well. They went above and beyond to make sure I was taken care of."
"3","Not a bad little golf course location on the west side of Madison (Middleton).  The price is better than other Madison area courses, so if you want to hit a round but not go too far, this is affordable.  \n\nIt's an easy course to walk, especially the back 9.  The front has a tough climb from hole #7 to #8, but other than that, there's no reason to have a gas cart (unless you prefer it).\n\nCall ahead to make sure there aren't any special outings.  I've showed up on a weekday morning to hit a quick nine and have been turned away for an outing I wasn't aware of.\n\nI use the course for my \""rebound\"" rounds.  If I'm not hitting well, Tumbledown is good for my ego.  Most holes you can play your slice from another fairway.  If you're hitting well, you'll be very pleased with your scores.\n\nIn summary, while it's not the greatest course, it's an easy and affordable round.  \n\nIf you want highbrow golf with a strict dress code and PGA rules, go somewhere else.  Tumbledown is a nice place for a relaxing round or a group outing."
"2","This was my first time trying Culvers. It's nothing special and is comparable to Wendy's or any other fast food burger place."
"4","I've been to Verona a few times now and always sing the praises of Michaels.  The burgers and hot dogs are just what you'd expect from a place like this and the custard is outstanding and there are plenty of flavors to choose from. My favorite is the caramel and cashew.  It is a nice place to stop by and just a short walk from my hotel."
"3","There's a bar in Verona? What? Where? Down the street and around the corner from my apartment? Who knew.\n\nDraft House is definitely a nice change of pace and change of scenery from the typical downtown establishments. I didn't like that the bar seemed really isolated, but that may just be because I'm not the type to end my night at the same place that I started.\n\nAt 1:30AM on a Saturday night, there was still a healthy handful of folks hanging out. I liked the two floor set-up and the laid-back vibe, but if I had my way, this would not be my first choice of late night establishments."
"2","The place is under construction so VERY limited seating.  Was very cold inside.  Very dark lighting as most fixtures were missing.  holes in ceiling and walls torn apart.  Some guy at the bar in camouflage seated us and took waitress almost 10 minutes to greet us.  There was only one other couple in the place.  Food wasn't terrible but lacked flavor.  Decent prices but the Greek music was competing with the country radio station that was blaring in the bar area.  Was just really weird!!!!!"
"2","The bar area was nice, but the dining area was off-putting. That side of the restaurant needs repairs and lots of upgrades. The fresh bread was burnt and tough. The table was a bit crumby. I ordered the Shrimp Fettuccine Alfredo, which admittedly was bland. The server and service were great."
"2","I cannot believe I'm reviewing a McDonald's, but I've been to this location three times, and all three visits have been less than stellar.  \n\nFor starters, the \""drive thru\"" system is anything but convenient.  Getting in-and-out via the drive-thru requires you to take 2 full laps around the building - the way the entrance is configured, you must enter their parking lot via the side of the property.  You then drive counter-clockwise around the building to the spot where you order.  Then you drive to get your \""food,\"" at which point you're beyond the entrance/exit spot.  So, you have to take another counter-clockwise spin around the parking lot before you can exit.\n\nIt's a terribly inefficient system, and it's somewhat dangerous, as drivers leaving the primary drive-thru lane with their food rarely look for cars circling the building trying to get to the drive-thru.  It's difficult to explain... but go there once, and you'll understand what I'm trying to describe.\n\nOk... entrance/egress aside, let's talk about this location.  It's a McDonald's, so the food is going to be exactly the same as you'd find from any other McDonald's in the world (thanks corporate farming/food prep/chemistry!), which means the service makes or breaks the experience.\n\nToday's experience was especially interesting/frustrating.  I was in Verona, helping a coworker with some home improvement work.  It was around midmorning, and his kids were in the mood for McD's.  Since I was the cleanest of the group, I volunteered to drive and pick-up the grub.  I hopped into the car and made my way over to Mickey Ds, where the drive thru was backed-up (thanks to lack of dual ordering points).\n\nWhen I reached the spot to order, I started placing the order.  I don't often go to McDonald's, so I'm not terribly familiar with the protocol... the first item on my list was identified as a \""large #3 with Coke.\""  \n\nMcD's Microphone Dude: \""Sir, Sir, Sir - I'm sorry, sir - we don't have a large size breakfast item, we only do that at lunch and dinner, sir.\""\n\nMe: \""Oh?  So they can't get a large Coke?\""\n\nMDMD: \""Sir, I'm sorry, we only have one size for breakfast - we don't have large size breakfasts.\""\n\nMe: \""Ok?  I only need a large Coke with that #3.  Not trying to Supersize or anything, just adding a large Coke.\""\n\nMDMD: \""Sir, no - sir, we don't Supersize any longer.  We have large drinks, but we don't Supersize, and we only have one size for breakfast.\""\n\nMe: \""Let's start over.  Could I have a #3 - the biscuit thing, with a Large Coke?\""\n\nMDMD: (long pause) \""Do you want a large Coke?\""\n\nMe: \""Yes, and the #3.\""\n\nMDMD: (long pause) \""So, that's a #3 with large Coke?\""\n\nMe: \""Yes.\""\n\nMDMD: \""Ok.\""\n\nMe: (long pause) \""Can I continue with the order?\""  (looked at screen thing and saw that he got the #3 with large Coke correct)\n\nMDMD: (long pause) \""Yes.\""\n\nMe: ...ordered rest of meals for friend and his kids...\n\nMDMD: Ok, if everything looks correct, proceed to the first window, where we'll have your total ready.\n\nMe: ...drives around...\n\nKid at window: \""That'll be $18.14.\""\n\nMe: \""Sorry for the confusion - I thought you could order a large beverage with your breakfast meal.\""\n\nKid at window: \""You can.\""\n\nMe: \""So, why all of the confusion?\""\n\nKid: \""I don't take the orders here, I just take the money. They take the order at the next window.\""\n\nMe: \""Oh, ok.\""\n\nSo, I go to the next window and the kid explains that he thought I wanted a large sized hash browns, and went to great length to explain that they don't have large hash browns, only regular size.  Ok, whatever...\n\nI returned to my friend's house only to discover they forgot to include the #3 part of the food order... so, we got the large Coke, but no biscuit or hash brown.  UGH!  I gave away my breakfast in the interest of not having to return.\n\n\nPrevious visits included a bout with cold/hard fries and a botched burger order (asked for onions only; got everything but onions), and a less than enthusiastic balding manager dude who seemed to act as if someone had just stomped on his toes a few seconds before I arrived to his window.\n\nThanks to this McDonald's, I'm convinced that I won't need to visit another McDonald's ever again.  I think I'll go watch Supersize Me again, just for good measure."
"3","I am sorry to have to give Craig's Cake Shop only three stars because I was expecting and hoping for better.\nThe staff was nice and the product was ok but it did not rise to what I was expecting to find based upon their many good reviews and the fact that they are a small local bakery as opposed to some large producer of a variety of baked goods.\nI compare it to Cupcakes A-Go-Go which exceeded my expectations in flavor and quality while CCS didn't do this.  Though CCS does use a very pretty frosting technique we didn't particularly like the flavor.  The cake was moist enough but the crumb and flavor did not reach to the level of what we have experienced from other bakery that we have purchased.  We once had an outstanding cake from The Rolling Pin and another one that was good was purchased at Metcalf's.  \nWe decided to try CCS in the hopes that we would find another bakery to add to our best list.  Instead, we will be going back to the Rolling Pin or Metcalf's for our next cake.\nThree stars state what is an a-okay rating which these cakes were just a notch below in relation to our high expectations.  But to not be so harsh I will give them this rating."
"2","I had a gift certificate for one free brunch so I went there with my mother (who happens to live across the street) one recent Sunday morning. There were very few people in the restaurant, probably because it was the Sunday after Thanksgiving. We were seated right away but it took a while for a server to come to our table. It really wasn't a big deal since it's a self-serve buffet after all, but we flagged down the manager because we had a question. \n\nAlthough the brunch is quite extensive, it is rather pricey at $16. Since my mother is a little older now, she doesn't eat a lot so we politely asked if she could just have a muffin or something small from the buffet and pay a reduced price instead of being charged for a full brunch. This manager (I didn't get her name) picked up the gift certificate and seemed perturbed by the very question! We heard an inaudible remark as she read it over, making it blatantly obvious she DID NOT want to accommodate this simple request. She reluctantly gave in and then walked away as if she was pissed that she agreed to it. \n\nWhatever her name, this so-called manager definitely does NOT belong in hospitality, much less in charge of a popular water-front restaurant! She only smiles when you are greeted, but otherwise has a general rough, hardened look to her. As I ate my meal, she made it a point to check our table to make sure my mother wasn't getting more that just a muffin as agreed-- (oh no!!) On top of that, they TAXED my FREE gift certificate! What a lousy way to treat your customers and such stingy business practices!"
"2","Went for Sunday brunch. Edible items include bacon and funnel cake strips. Everything else appeared to have been purchased frozen from Sam's club."
"3","I ate here for dinner, on a personal recommendation. I'm giving it two and a half stars but will try to give it a shot during lunchtime. For those familiar with the buffet scene in Dane County, eating here made me nostalgic for Taste of Asia buffet on E. Washington that closed down several years ago. Now that was a buffet. Oysy comes close, but maybe this review isn't the space for me to dwell on other restaurants' quality. \n\nThe mussels with creamy white sauce on it was ok, so was the battered shrimp. Eggs food young was so so.  I liked the chow mein. The egg drop soup was especially yellow.  I didn't eat at the dessert aisle, by then I was just stuffed.  \n\nThe wait staff was friendly and so was the youngish looking kid behind the cashier. My fortune cookie was meaningful, so I'll take with me a good memory and the antacid."
"3","Stopped there last night after driving by many times in the past to get some food to go.  Not the best Chinese food I have ever had but it was pretty good!\n\nSeemed to be well organized considering the amount of carry out orders that were picked up while I was there.\n\nDecor isn't the best... wall decor lights not plugged in, burned out light bulbs...yet the place was brightly lit.  \n\nFriendly but I am not a fan of staff wearing jeans at any restaurant but that is just my opinion as is all of this.\n\nOver all I will be stopping back to try many other things on their extensive menu."
"3","Grade: C-\n\nUmmm. Hmmm. Okay. Uhhhh. Huh. Right. What should I say? Yeah."
"3","Comfortably Decent\nBy no means the greatest bar in Madison, but I'd say it's quite a bit better than the handful of other bars within 1-2 blocks of it.\nThe decor is alright, but I'm easily mesmerized by a fish tank. The outdoor patio is large, but therefore quite popular. Menu is okay, but heavy on burgers. My tilapia sandwich was quite satisfactory, though. And I'm always a sucker for waffle fries."
"5","Best place ever! The staff are trained and educated and create a very comfortable environment. They also help with all kinds of concerns and issues."
"2","I LOVE chipotle but when comparing this locations to others, I get about half as my food in my burrito bowl. Seriously, at home I get enough for an entire second meal after I'm full. It would be great if the employees would just add a little more to the burrito bowls."
"4","Fresh, fresh, FRESH. There is no other fast food chain imaginable that has the local, wholesome, fresh, and ethical outlook that Chipotle does."
"3","Good food. Great location. Good atmosphere (especially in the atrium) and great sangria. We will go back!"
"1","If you like sausages, EDM and the smell of bleach, this place is for you! Trying way too hard to be swank in a town much better suited to chill lounge. The only good thing is that I discovered Ami's next door."
"5","Amazing food.\nService was excellent as well.\n\nI suppose when you pay these sort of prices you would better expect great good followed by great service."
"5","We started our evening with custom printed menus with our names on them commemorating our anniversary that we were celebrating. Our server Joe was phenomenal. Detailed knowledge of the 3 and 7 course meals offered for the evening. I have a gluten allergy that we alerted them to prior to arrival and all of the options were thoughtful customized to suit my needs. I had the 3 course meal with wine pairing that was perfectly matched  for each serving. We were seated next to the windows overlooking the Capitol. Perfect evening!"
"4","Organized, vast and reasonably-priced assortment of rocks, minerals, jewelry and fossils. \n\nBurnie's is a modest-sized store located a 1/2 mile or so from downtown. Within this shop, they include as much per square foot as I have seen in like establishments (white space be damned). \n\nRock enthusiasts love their selection. Their prices are on par with larger shops and Burnie's includes more higher quality selections. \n\nMy child was excited by the dinosaur fossils and the learning kits ($2.50 kits explaining and tying together minerals, rocks fossils and ore with real materials).\n\nThe only thing missing was the ability to mine for gemstones via the five-gallon bucket. Of course, lack of space prohibits it, but to engage non-rock enthusiast ... hands-on activity is important.  \n\nRegardless, its nearly perfect for anyone that would seek it out in the 1st place. More space could add to more fun ... but it would likely be at the expense of its convenient location."
"5","I have been going to Bernie's since I was a little girl. My first vivid memory was in first grade, when I wanted to display my rock collection for the school's \""Share Fair.\"" I had some cool specimen's that I needed help identifying, so my parents took me to Bernie's. Even as a child, the staff were so amazing and helpful to me. I remember one employee going through books, explaining how various types of rocks were formed and even teaching me about the Mohs Scale! Truly service at it's best. \n\nNow, I live in California, however I try to visit Bernie's when I am visiting my family in Madison. In August, I came home wearing my favorite antique scarab bracelet. It broke, I nearly lost it in the Memorial Union bathroom! My dad took me right to Bernie's (well, after breakfast at Lazy Jane's).  They were as always, so helpful. Took all my info and had no qualms at all about shipping it to me in Oakland. They quoted me two weeks to complete the laser welding needed for the repair. It was done on time, very reasonably priced and I felt completely confident leaving the antique bracelet in their hands. \n\nI love Bernie's!"
"5","I have been going to Studio 924 for every month for about a year now and I can't imagine being without it. Katy V is an AMAZING stylist and she seems like the only one who can handle my thick unruly hair. Plenty of of excellent product as well!"
"3","This isn't normally the type of restaurant we'd go to, but they were offering Restaurant.com girft certificates, so we gave them a shot. I reviewed the menu prior to going and knew what to expect -- overpriced American food. But, with the cert. it ended up being a pretty reasonably priced meal for three (including drinks and a dessert). The food actually wasn't bad -- everything was fresh and warm. \n\nThe service was great! Everyone was super friendly and our waitress was very nice and informative. When I realized she'd overcharged on something, she corrected it without the least bit of irritation. \n\nBeer prices were okay, wine was pretty high (didn't even get into mixed). All in all, I would say their food isn't bad, but you can get much better for much less a few blocks away. If it's convenient for you, it's really not the worst you could do. With a coupon, it comes out comparable to other places that don't have the convenience of a hotel."
"2","I don't go here often and with good reason -- there doesn't seem to be anything this bar offers that another place doesn't do better. If I wanted to dance or act crazy - there is Brothers. If I want to sit outside - I'd goto Vintage or Johnny O's. If I wanted a quieter place to sit down and talk - there is Red Shed, Segredo's(cause its usually dead) or Blue Velvet. The drinks are OK, the bartenders are OK and its ok to stop on a bar crawl but not somewhere I stay for long."
"5","Not sure what more to add than the staff is extremely knowledgeable and helpful.  I have been using the pharmacy services for almost 2 decades.  They will go above and beyond for their customers if it's needed.  I can't imagine going to a chain Rx after having had this kind of nice personal service.  Oh and they are the first place I look for uncommon brands of health supplies.  They can't be found at wa_-__rt."
"4","Ragstock is one of those stores you could spend hours in just looking around. It has a cool vibe, and they carry a huge variety of new, vintage, and thrifty clothing and accessories. \nAlthough not everything is of a high quality, it is very affordable. Especially on the sale racks, you can always find something for a steal. \nI've shopped at the Madison location many times and am excited to hear one is coming to the Fox River Mall in Appleton."
"3","Jolly Bob's was... okay.\n\nCame here for dinner yesterday and found that the bar was extremely crowded, and blocked off the dining area. I was not greeted by anyone, I needed to get the attention of someone to ask to be put on a list.\n\nIt took over half an hour to get seated. Was served bread reasonably quickly and service once seated was actually decent overall. Bread was good and fresh, Salad was also very good. Then the entrees came. \n\nI got the Avo Cat, which itself was good, but not great for its price. The accompaniments were also just... okay. Rice was particularly dry. Some of my dining companions had food was also merely okay (4oz mahi mahi for 13.50?, dry chicken in a curry dish?)\n\nWhen it was time to take the bill, the server couldn't be bothered to split the cash only bill. \n\nI may come back again some time for drinks, as what my companions had were quite good, but I'm not so sure I'd come back for dinner again."
"4","Bath and body works needs to take a lesson from this place. So many home made soaps you'll stay clean for 30 lifetimes. They also have your reflexology covered wih starter kits, oils, and oodles of goodies that'll make you smell and feel pretty. Only downfall is that it's a wee pricey, but if you do around you can find something more budget friendly."
"3","I've always enjoyed coming here for brunch.  Great savory dishes as well as sweet brunch dishes.  They have great espresso drinks.  \n\nIt is popular, so you should be OK with eating at the bar if you do not make advance reservations.  But it's delicious and oh so worth it.\n\nWhile it's a nice, solid place for brunch, there could be a bit more pizazz. I like going here, but it's the brunch place I take people to when we can't come up with another option."
"4","Ever wonder who started the fair trade coffee brigade?  Well Michelangelo's is one of the first!  \n\nThis place is truly for the coffee purist.  If you don't want your palate muddled by milky add ins and pumps of sugar, you will be pleased that Michelangelo's offers coffee imported from gosh darn every continent you can think of.  But you can sure pick from a bunch of other sweet coffee drinks too! \n\nTea drinkers don't stray away.  You can fill your tea cup with all sorts of white, black, or green teas.  \n\nExtra seating in the back allows you and your hunny bunny to snuggle up and sip on your brews in privacy.  \n\nKeep your eyes open.  This place is so close to the capitol, you might stumble upon a politician!"
"2","On a charitable day I might've given Isthmus 3 stars, but I also felt the need to balance out the inflated marks it's gotten so far. Every Madison-size or larger community benefits from having a free, weekly alternative newspaper, and The Isthmus is definitely handy for concert and show listings, farmers' market schedules, restaurant reviews, etc etc. But by and large the content is kinda weak. Bill Lueders occasionally has an interesting article in his watchdog column, also occasionally gets apoplectic about rather trivial issues. The media reviewers (Dean Robbins, Kenneth Burns) are consistently lousy. Every so often there's an interesting feature article. The Isthmus also likes to play up its independence but takes potshots at other local media on a regular basis. \n  I'm glad there's a free weekly in Madison, but I really wish there was a better one than The Isthmus. Madison's an interesting and  dynamic community, and it deserves better."
"2","As lovers of sketchy Jamaican and Caribbean restaurants, my boyfriend and I (newcomers to Madison) decided to try Jamerica for dinner. We had sampled their jerk chicken at Taste of Madison this summer but wanted to get the full experience, not to mention that I had a mad craving for some coconut rice and stewed cabbage. It was cold outside, so we decided to grab a case of Capital's Winter Skal and get our jerk chicken to go. Entrees on the dinner menu range from 11.50-15.50 each, which is pushing it for me, but they are cooked to order which is much appreciated. Jerk chicken will set you back 11.50, and if you want some delicious plantains they'll charge another $3. The chicken was dark meat, skin on, bone in and we got 4 thighs with our one meal. The jerk sauce was not very spicy or flavorful, and the chicken was quite greasy. The rest of the styrofoam takeout container was filled with a mixture of stewed cabbage, carrots, and broccoli on one side and rice and red beans on the other. Not much flavor there either :( In my opinion the best part were the plantains, but as I said earlier it was $3 for about 6 or 7 pieces. \nThe inside is very inviting on a cold night and the decor is eclectic. Next time I'll go for lunch and stay a while. In the meantime, I'll try David's."
"1","I seldom write review and so whoever is reading this must understand how bad the food was. \nI'm a regular customer here and the food is generally good and so I order delivery from S2YD a lot. However, the last time I made an order(Goat Curry) the food was close to untouchable. \nThe Styrofoam box in which the food came was dripping with oil. I ignored this, and on eating the rice I realized it was either not well cooked or that they had reheated what they kept in the fridge. Needless to say, I didn't touch the meat fearing for my life.\nThat was the last time I ever ordered from Jamerica - and its been almost 2 months now."
"2","So, Jolly Bob's is now closed, and I was in search of something to fill the massive hole it left in my heart (and stomach). Sadly, Jamerica just did not do that.\n\nImmediately, I liked the vibe: chill, serve yourself a beverage from the cooler, motherly figure waiting on you. But that was kind of it. The rest was disappointing.\n\nI ordered the chicken curry and a Jamaican beef patty to start, and was then told they were out of both. So I switched to a veggie patty and BBQ chicken. My companions ordered Mango Rundown Tofu and Jerk Chicken.\n\nThe BBQ chicken was good, but nothing particularly amazing. The sauce was spicy and not too sweet. The tofu was pretty good, but really sweet, and between the tofu, stewed veggies, and rice, it was all the kind of the same texture. The jerk chicken was best: spiced well and tender. The sides, rice and beans and stir fried veggies were nothing spectacular, but they rounded out the plate.\n\nOverall, it was just kind of underwhelming. Probably won't be rushing back any time soon."
"3","Its open late and always hits the spot.  Fries in a paper bag and gyron to go with lots of white sauce on the side.  I've eaten here when not totally drunk and the food is good.  The greek salad and gyros are always a safe bet."
"2","Quick food.  Not surprisingly it tastes like a chain"
"5","This is frankly the best Mediterranean food restaurant in Madison and trust me I've tried them all. Everything from the excellent food, Faysal's unmatched hospitality, and the staff's friendliness just keeps making me come back and back again to this place to satisfy my Mediterranean food cravings!"
"1","I think people give this place 4 or 5 stars because they WANT to like it, and want to feel worldly and cosmopolitan. My primary complaint with this place is that it is far too expensive for what it is. \n\nI ordered one of the chicken entrees, at $14.95, and it tasted fine- nothing special though, and I was still hungry after devouring it. So hungry that I went and had two slices at Ian's.  It was just one chicken breast with some sauce and a small patch of rice. It also came with a small bowl of soup, which was flavorless. This is not a fancy place- it's basically a cafeteria, which is fine by me, but why the fine dining prices and small portions? I'm amazed that people in Madison are willing to pay these prices for such small portions. I should say, also, that I very rarely leave a restaurant still hungry, so it's not like I have a super sized appetite."
"2","I just arrived in Madison and was pooped from a long day + travel. I was really hungry and excited for a low key, hot meal. I had a bunch of work to catch up on so searched for a vegetarian friendly place that would also deliver. I was excited to find veggie Nepalese food that was close to the hotel. Every dish, even things that seemed like sides seemed pretty expensive so I assumed the portions would be enormous. I don't want enormous portions but I also didn't want teeny portions with a high price tag. I ordered a soup and it was basically a cup of soup for over $10. I didn't order anything else sadly and am left feeling pretty hungry. Wahh. Haha. \n\nShould have read more of the reviews!!!"
"3","I love the atmosphere of this place. Total college hole in the wall, relatively authentic Nepalese food with great service. I had the wheat gluten dish, which was ok but too salty for my taste and overpriced. I think their tarkari is worth it and I wish I had gotten that instead."
"5","An excellent Italian restaurant in downtown Madison, WI. We caught this place out of the corner of our eye and boy am I glad we stopped in for dinner. It's not a large place, but it's very cozy and we had a great time kidding around with the staff. The food is excellent - every one of the six of us in the group had nothing but good things to say.\n\nThey brought some freshly-baked bread to the table and we ate probably 3-4 baskets of the stuff. The butter for the bread was awesome. I wish I could remember what was in it (it was a compound butter) but I can't. Just know that it's really good.\n\nSalads for our group were: Insalata Caprise (mozzarella, tomatoes, artichokes, basil, garlic, olive oil); House salads, we tried different dressings including Spicy Gorgonzola, Spicy tomato and Italian Chunk. Each were great but I'll warn you that the spicy part is true. It's a heat that builds up the more you eat it. Delicious.\n\nI had the Spaghetti Alla Bolognese which was to die for. The sauce is wonderful and the dish was served with a small side of sauteed green beans. For such a simple dish, I was very impressed. Others in our group had Rigatoni Alla Vodka (both gave it great reviews) and Fettuccine Alla Corsara (pasta w/ salmon) and it also got great reviews.\n\nI highly recommend this restaurant - we were blown away by the food and the wait staff."
"4","We went for restaurant week. The food was good, the service excellent, the atmosphere nice. My husband's steak was not the best steak ever, so perhaps at full prices we would have been a bit disappointed, but the rest of the meal was quite good. \n\nWe brought our baby and felt comfortable. There was a range of people dressed casually to very dressed up, and the restaurant had a pleasant buzz but was not loud."
"3","I've only been here once because Capitol Chophouse sucked my wallet dry that day.\n\nI had the 18 oz. ribeye, which was juicy and tender. The Capitol chop salad was pretty good too. I have absolutely no complaints about the food itself.\n\nBut I just can't justify coming here. The $$$ sign on Yelp should be changed to $$$$. Capitol Chophouse is definitely a pricey restaurant. I'm assuming it's because rent downtown, and especially within a hotel, is high. For the price you pay, there are surely better options out there. Try Tornado if you haven't already. Costs are more or less the same, but the quality and options are a lot better."
"3","I was taken aback by the entrance and how the signs instruct you to go upstairs to Sunroom Cafe. If my friend hadn't recommended it for breakfast I most likely would not have gone up since peering up the stairs it looked kind of sketchy.\n\nOnce you reach the top of the stairs, the door to the right opens up to a simplistic cute cafe. Tables and chairs are spread throughout the cafe with paintings on the wall. People are socializing over brunch, reading a book/paper or tapping away on their laptop.\n\nOrder up at the counter and then your name is called when your food is ready. Food is incredibly cheap and simple - two eggs, potatoes and bacon were $3.50 and then another $1.50 for a single pancake. Wow. Price is right and the atmosphere is cozy."
"4","It's been a while since I've eaten at Sunroom Cafe but I fondly remember healthy breakfasts, tasty lunches and classy dinners that shine on State St. The space is, dur, filled with sunlight and while it can be a little warm at times, it's a great little place to grab a meal with friends and catch up. \n\nMy favorite meal here has to be breakfast...delicious baked goods, tasty lattes, and loads of quiche. Nom Nom. As other have said - be ready for a line, especially during the weekend morning hours when college kids are rolling out of bed. The space is most certainly cramped but if you don't mind waiting in line a bit, snagging a meal is worth it. If you're coming during the lunch hours, any and all of their salads are thoroughly delightful. \n\nThanks for the memories, Sunroom. Hope I see you soon!"
"4","Great on a Saturday morning when you're hungover from celebrating the 25th reunion with college buddies. Crazy Legs was getting set to start on the Capitol steps (damn healthy people). It set the stage for a late breakfast here at the Sunroom.\nBack in college, I must have walked past this place thousands of times. It's doorway and menu just a blip on the State Street radar. From the other side of the street, I'd see the place and think, 'Hmm, I should try that sometime' only to have my ADHD divert me to something shiny somewhere.\nWe walk up the stairs and stand in line to order at the counter. Smallish place, reminds me of a cafe. Chalkboard menu, just like a cafe. I ordered the huevos ranchero with veggie chili (that's the only chili they had) and coffee. Coffee was great as we waited for our food. I wasn't sure how to get more coffee once I was done. Wasn't sure if I was supposed to flag down someone, go up and poor myself, stand in line and pay for another cup. So I played stupid (perfected this move) and asked one of the workings girls as she passed by. She was nice enough to get me a cup. :)\nFood arrives and we dig in. I honestly don't remember much as I was hungry and hungover, but I ate the whole thing. I walked out of there feeling good about the day and ready for another night of celebrating. Starting with the Essen Haus at 3pm. Damn, I missed Madison."
"4","What I love about this location over the two that I am used to in Milwaukee is the basement used vinyl section. The two in Milwaukee run their vinyl on the floor, completely packed. I always have to sit on the floor, pull some out, and move like 20 at a time.\n\nThis location has 75% of the stuff in bins that I can stand and pick through...and the best part is that there is no one in the basement, so you don't feel weird if you want to sit there for two hours literally looking through every album. I don't feel welcome to do that at the one on 76th st in Milwaukee."
"4","Tonight I was on a mission. I wanted a delicious but cheap sandwich. After thinking for a bit, I remembered Mildred's. I'd been there once before as a kid, but couldn't remember the experience. I didn't recall disliking it, so it must have been at least decent.\n\nWhen I got their I looked over their pretty lengthy menu. They really do have a lot of choices. All appeared to be quite delicious on paper. I finally decided on the Blystone. When I went to pay with my debit card, I was told that they only except cash and to use the ATM in the corner. Unfortunately the ATM turned out to be on the fritz and I had to go to a corner store and use their ATM.\n\nAnyway, the sandwich TOTALLY made up for the slight ATM inconvenience. After reading reviews here I was only expecting an okay sandwich, but seriously... this thing was great. It was pretty big and I probably should have saved half for later, but I was starving. It filled me up, that's for sure. Definitely worth going back for. Next time I'll be sure to have some cash on hand."
"4","Haters gone hate"
"2","Terrible service, the food was okay. Restaurant was empty but we had to wait 20 minutes for the waiter to come and give us food. We were literally the only customers."
"2","I trusted the madison yelpers to help me find good restaurants and madison and buraka was among the very top there. Unfortunately, the food wasn't anything special. It wasn't bad in any way, just a little bland and not inspiring. I've had better east african food in most african restaurants in chicago."
"2","I've had a lot better Ethiopian than I was served at Buraka. There is a decent percentage of veg options, which I appreciate, but the menu overall isn't very broad. They also don't have sampler platters for individuals, except for a two-entree combination option which costs more than one entree for approximately the same amount of food. \n\n I ordered a combination of the misir wot and the black beans, both described as spicy. Wary due to other Yelp reviews, I emphasized to the server that I like my food spicy, and she assured me that the two dishes are indeed quite spicy. They were not. More significantly, they simply weren't very flavorful. Nor was the injera, usually a highlight of my Ethiopian restaurant experiences.  Halfway through the meal the server offered hot sauce, which helped,but I ultimately expect more flavor in the food itself. \n\nThe ambiance is nice, and they have patio dining, but I'd give this restaurant a definite pass in the future."
"4","Dr. Bonsett-Veal was great!  I think he is very personal and related to me quickly.  He was my first eye-doctor visit ever and I felt great.  He also explained my options, like whether to get glasses or not for my slight vision correction, and an extra 'eye-mapping' test.  Which I got and he emailed to me so I have on my records!  \n\nI went sunglass shopping there because he recommended it, they were very helpful to help us look around, however the prices were higher than other places, and the cheap glasses didn't fit as well as we would've liked, besides that I thought it was perfect."
"2","I had a pretty frustrating experience with the Bonsett-Veal office similar to Christopher H's review. I chose their business over others simply because of proximity to my house and I expected a quick and simple prescription renewal like I've had for years at my old optometrist's office. Their staff is friendly and Dr. Bonsett-Veal is nice enough but the \""scientific method\"" that another reviewer refers to isn't conducive to easy, breezy prescription renewals.\nI've had a stable prescription for many years and have never run into an optometrist who had an issue finding the right glasses and contacts prescription. With my first appointment, I was given a both glasses and contact prescriptions that were considerably lower than I have had in the past but I trusted that they would work. \nIt took multiple visits to the office to finally get comfortable contacts and a prescription close to what I've had. Weeks later, I had to return to their office after ordering glasses using the Bonsett-Veal prescription and it being just as awful as the contact prescriptions. \nDuring each appointment, I felt like the staff was rushing me and that no one really believed that the prescriptions weren't effective. I'm due for my yearly appointment with them but I definitely won't be returning because of how much of a hassle it turned out to be."
"4","An absolutely beautiful mansion sitting on the top of Pinckney overlooking the capital building and the rest of the city. We went over a 4th of July weekend in the summer so prices were jacked way up. Honestly, for what we paid, I can't say MHI was worth it. But looking at their standard rate card, prices seem to improve during regular days (although regardless they seem more like Chicago prices than Madison prices to this Chicago-ite)\n\nWe arrived in the afternoon and had to ring a doorbell to gain admittance. This was a standard procedure every time we came back: guests do not receive a key to the exterior door and someone is up 24/7 to let you in. When we walked in, there was a beautiful bar and sitting area to our left, and a lounge with fireplace to our right. We were shown our room which was an \""english basement\"" style room. Not too much light, but nicely appointed, frette sheets, aveda bath products, a heated bathroom floor, and terry cloth robes. A small desk, sitting chair, large bureau, a chest of drawers, and 42\"" flat screen completed the decor. Oh, and a huge picture of Lance Armstrong. Huh? Yeah, turns out Trek the bike company owns the whole place, oddly enough. So don't be surprised when you see B&W biking pictures everywhere. \n\nAnyways, the bed was extremely comfortable and we heard absolutely no noise the entire time we were in our room despite the Inn having several other occupants. The staff were quite pleasant and helpful when we hung out in the lounge, making us feel quite welcome and comfortable with a never ending supply of nuts and candy, and eating (the included) continental breakfast on the deck off the lounge was a nice experience. \n\nThe Inn overall is beautifully decorated; think lots of marble, wood, and restored tile. And a wonderful circular staircase up the middle of the house. I wouldn't do the lower floor room again though (room 3.) It was dead quiet, but also dark and a little gloomy. They pitched us specifically on that room vs. another because it was larger, but I'd rather have light than a few extra square feet the next time."
"5","If I could live here I would! The service is second to none and each room is unique.\nThey just added a B-cycle bike share kiosk and that's a major bonus. My wife and I have stayed here 3 times already and hope to get back soon for a 2 night stay."
"5","I love Shakti. I can always find something wonderful. It might be a t-shirt or possibly a candle. Their jewelry is moderately priced and beautiful. If you need incense or a book you can find it here. I just like walking into the place. It gives you a really great, peaceful feeling."
"3","I have mixed feelings for this restaurant. \n\nThe first time I went there the service was terrible, the waitress was more concerned with talking to the cooks than getting my order filled in a timely manner. If they were able more busy at that moment I wouldn't mind as much, but at the time I was the ONLY one there. \n\nThe second time, there were two waitresses and a little bit more people, however the girls were still too busy with gossiping in the corner, but they were more effective with the service, I guess it helped I was sitting at the actual sushi bar that time. \n\nThe sushi itself is mediocre at best, I just moved to Madison and have a little pet project to try all the sushi restaurants in town to try to find my favorite. \n\nFrom my experience a Boston Roll consists of shrimp, avocado, and mayo. Their's apparently is just salmon and avocado. The only thing I found close was the Hidden Tiger Roll on their daily special roll that had eel in it. Reading through their menu it all seemed very plain and not following any of the recipe for the \""traditional\"" rolls I've seen at other sushi restaurants. Also, the taste of the rolls themselves are rather bland."
"3","I wish I had better things to say, but this is sadly a joint that should have stayed in my undergraduate days. I wanted to say this is for people on budget BUT, its not that cheap either.\n\nThe place is decent, clean and the sushi chef is friendly greeting us when we came in and was leaving.\n\nI would say, I wouldn't eat any raw stuff here, and the cooked dish I got was also so-so. Tonkatsu was dry and batter was not really there. $14.50 instead of the $10 lunch price I get at King Muramoto... nah. not gonna work.\n\nThe only saving grace was the hot miso soup on the cold day I visited. \n\nJust not worth the price you pay, and the low traffic in the restaurant on Friday night makes me doubt the freshness of the sashimi and sushi they have."
"2","First, the good:  The room was nice and clean and the staff were incredibly friendly and helpful.\n\nNow, the bad:  for some reason, no one seems to have noticed the INCREDIBLY LOUD PLUMBING in this place.  I was staying in one of the rooms that had a view of the lake and whenever one of the three neighboring bathrooms would turn on their water, it would make more noise than my alarm clock.  The view was quite nice, but since I'm here for a job interview, I care more about sleep than scenery.  \n\nTo the hotel's credit, when I called the front desk at 11:30pm b/c I couldn't take it anymore, the fellow at the desk came right up to take me to a new room, helped carry my bags over, and refused a tip.  He was really quite courteous and friendly.  Without the exceptional service, I'd give this an Eeks!  \n\nStill, if you stay here and want primarily to be able to sleep, I recommend asking for a street-view room instead of a lake-view room.  You will have fewer shared walls and the adjacent rooms will be more likely to be empty so you will sleep better. \n\nAlso, I have the same weird skin thing from the water...it might just be that I'm not used to the low humidity here, but I'd expect that to show up as chapped lips first.  My legs and shins are all itchy and scratchy...kinda weird.  \n\nGratefully, no spiders..."
"2","They close the Hilton Honors lounge on the week ends. Very disappointing because they only offer you one drink card to replace the lounge. Very unusual for a Hilton , seems to be a mini Hilton in many respects. Not what I am use to in services, for a Hilton would be ok as a Best Western and the rates should then be lower."
"2","Went there on a saturday night.  Super loud, crazy music, and people all hovering in front of the flavors.  Too chaotic.  Yogurt not particularly good (and it does NOT take a particularly good version to please me.  Dissapointing - just ok."
"5","I'm a Wisconsinite who doesn't really care for ice-cream (yes, we do exist) and I love this stuff. It's probably the only ice-cream that I will eat.\n\nI had Chocolate Shoppe Ice Cream as a treat when I was growing up. If you're not a local and can't stop by here often, you HAVE to try their Blue Moon and Zanzibar. Blue Moon is a unique flavor of ice-cream that's virtually impossible to find outside of WI. And they are known for their Zanzibar.\n\nEven the classic flavors here are delish. Their cookie dough is smooth and creamy with flecks of chocolate and soft and tasty chunks of cookie dough. They offer lots of flavors, sometimes it's hard to choose.\n\nThe service can be hit-or-miss and on summer weekends the place is packed. This is TRUE ice-cream. It's creamy and thick and delicious. Don't think about how many calories you're eating, just enjoy and experience it."
"3","My biggest gripe: The employees either need to step up their game or management needs to hire more employees. It is the middle of summer and I would expect an ice cream shop to be up-staffed in anticipation of the increase in customers. For the amount of foot traffic that the Chocolate Shoppe gets between 7-9PM on a warm summer night, they are seriously, seriously understaffed.\n\nI'm not one to complain about standing in line for 15-30 minutes for a scoop of ice cream (especially if I'm craving it), but unfortunately, Chocolate Shoppe doesn't really deliver. There are many flavors, yes, but I feel like the quality of the ice cream they serve is way too commercial (read: overly processed). I could probably pick up a no-name pint of the same flavored ice cream at the Copps down the street and not be able to tell the difference. \n\nGiven the other options in the area (including UW's own Babcock Hall Dairy Store), it will be a long while until I'm back."
"3","The food was ok, I love waffle fries and the produced some spicy delicious ones so I was pretty happy.  Drinks were cheapo schmepo (again I'm from out of town and found Madison delightfully affordable) but the main event here was the boxing game.  \nWe were with a group of family and friends in town for a wedding and everyone was getting into this thing...my boyfriend, my brother, my uncle, even our friends in town from Norway (in their 50s) were all over this thing!  It was so fun!\nThey had a ton of stuff to chose from so it's an easy to please all type of place.  also a lot of seating, inside and out, so it was a great stop for us.  Nothing amazing and above and beyond but fun for a college town."
"2","I feel hungover and the guilt of being underage just by walking by this place.  Unless I'm super drunk to begin with, I'm probably not venturing in.\n\nOn another note, I gave this a second star because I hear they have (or used to have) a stock market pricing system where drinks cost more or less based on demand.  It's the only way I've ever really understood the economy, and that combined with the fact that they serve alcohol, merits two proud stars."
"5","Great Brats!"
"3","short menu, which is cool if ya want a burger or brat and a brew. Thought the brat was good and the beer cold. YOUNG crowd, thought the female bartender was a bit rude that being said had a good time watching the Bama / LSU game."
"3","I haven't been here in twenty years.  While in town for a Badger game and walk down memory lane, my husband came here to watch the Packer game on Sunday before returning home.\n\nWe sat at the bar and and the $4.50 huge cups of beer was a fantastic deal.  Two beers did me for the whole game.  Couldn't tell you the ounces.  But they were big, a little foamy but big\n\nBut I have to say, the service was pretty sad.  As we were looking straight at the kitchen we could see food sitting for quite awhile before it went out.  And while the women wait staff seemed to be running around quite a bit, the men just stood there.  There was popcorn all over the floor and they weren't even serving popcorn.  Still, noone seemed interested in cleaning it up.  When one guy asked to have his table wiped off, the bartender handed him a towel.  That was the general apathy.  Oh and then when a guy ordered a boot that she said cost $16, the customer gave her a $20 and she didn't give change back.  That was the same waitress who handed the customer the towel.  But then again, at least she was doing something - the men including the guy who I think was the manager, seemed to be doing nothing.\n\nMy husband and I were actually a little apprehensive about ordering food after witnessing all this mismanagement.  But I'm glad we did because the fried cheese curds were yummy.  And the tv was right in front of us so it was fine, mostly because it was cheap."
"5","I always have the beef and egg or ja jang meinn!!one of my favorite take out places for Chinese food in madison!!"
"4","Alright, I was torn on this place until I decided I really liked it.  I lived right up the street and I ate here all the time.  I tried the majority of their menu and have concluded that this is great feel-good soul fuel food.  The noodles are scrumptious, the dumplings are plump, the potstickers are delicious, and sauces are wholesome, and the Korean BBQ pork is really good.  You get a lot of food on your portion, and you can carryout.  That said, the noodles can be a bit heavy, and the dishes can get a bit greasy.  Still, it all tastes really good and while I can't speak to authenticity, it certainly warms a lonely evening."
"5","If you haven't been to Wah Kee, this restaurant needs to be next on your dining experience list. In a sea of pre-fab noodle places, Wah Kee continues to create all dishes from scratch, all noodles from scratch, and all of the  food is fresh and prepared masterfully by seasoned chefs. This dining spot has been around for years  and is family owned and operated. It is not glitzy like some of the national chains- but if you are interested in very good, authentic food at a very reasonable price, skip the bagged noodle places and try Wah Kee."
"4","Located in the western end of Willy St, Wah Kee is the best Cantonese/Guangdong style Chinese food in Madison. If you regularly go to restaurants in North American Chinatowns, this place will bring back your memories! \n\nWah Kee's menu is huge and even includes some Thai/Vietnamese items, but the highlights are in its Cantonese selections. Anything in the Lo Mein section is pretty good. Wonton Lo Mein is my favorite. They made wontons fresh and they are among the best I had in this country. \n\nThey offer some really authentic appetizers. I recommend you to resist your urge to order spring rolls and try out \""fried turnip cake\"", \""Yau Choi in Oyster Sauce\"", \""Sticky Rice in Lotus Leaf\"", \""BBQ pork buns\"", or \""scallion pancake.\"" It's pretty rare that you can find these dishes in the Midwest. \n\nRice in Clay Pot is also Wah Kee's specialty. Expect some preparing time but they worth the wait. \n\nI wanted to give it 5 stars (as appeared in the very first version of the review) because it is such a bargain for budget foodies, but 4 stars probably will do justice to other Chinese eateries in town. Nonetheless, Wah Kee is one of the best meals you can get under $10 in the Madtown."
"2","Blech. I'm half writing this as a note to myself to stop trying to eat here.\n\nSo, the noodles are clearly fresh, and it's a conceptual step up from the Americanized type Chinese one finds many other places here, and something different if you're not up for the heat level of Szechuan. But uh if you don't like fish? Skip this place. The first few times I thought maybe I made an ordering error, but there is no reason for BBQ Pork Lo Mein to taste and smell aggressively fishy. Both the broth (maybe there's some shrimp involved) and the noodles (which is far stranger). It's disconcerting and offputting. Maybe that's nitpicky of me, and maybe someone who ate fish wouldn't notice. But for me? GLECH. Their house-made hot sauce is awesome and conceals the worst of it, but I shouldn't -need- to conceal unwanted flavors like that.\n\nSo basically, Must Love Fish if you're gonna get the noodle dishes here. 4 stars in that case. If you want your pork to just be pork, then see rating above."
"1","The bookstore is, without a doubt, the most corporate bookstore in all of Madison. I'd even go so far as to label it a \""big brother\"" entity. The benefits of their return policy end within the first month of the semester. \n\nI had the ink for my printer cartridge refilled, only to experience problems with it the very next day. \n\nSometimes a student is left with no other choice, but I'd recommend any other route available, as far as buying books are concerned. \n\nBuying books online is not only cheaper, it's also worth the wait."
"5","The place was awesome. Food was EXCEPTIONAL. And definitely reasonably priced. Check it out. I know that I will be going back."
"5","The flavors are awesome. This is coming from a person who makes Indian food, so i know flavors and spices a lot.\nI am coming here next time too. I had catfish (Kari Lele) and it was tooo good."
"4","Finally got here. The food is excellent and if you ask for spicy they give it to you spicy and assume you can handle it. That in itself is worth it.  The veggie curry was superb, they have an excellent wine selection. Staff was friendly and they even brought out extra rice when they saw that we were running low."
"2","I don't normally review chain places anymore but I'll say this -- this Taco Bell isn't that good as far as Taco Bells go. I don't know why but some ingredients -- especially anything with rice -- tastes awful. I don't know if the Taco Bell/KFC's use a different ingredient base but I can't believe how bad things like the Cheesy Bean and Rice burrito taste. Other than that, it's Taco Bell..what's to say?"
"1","Rude, racist, dark. Unconscious drunk people at the bar or at the entrance smelling like urine. Homeless old men grabbing at my date. Pretty much an assault. Place attracts the detritus."
"2","I stopped eating here last summer.  I have a rule.  I cross any place off my list when I'm too distracted by all the flies to pick something from the menu.  \n\nI'd give one star, but, the saving grace is that all the flies are dead in the winter.  And Madison has a lot of winter."
"3","Like any place on/ near State St., parking sucks.\n\nOther than that it is really nice.  I had a simple ham sandwich and (although they forget the sprouts) it was so good and fresh, the wheat bread was nice and soft and the pasta salad with feta was fantastic.  According to my friend, you should always try the special because it was the best, but I was very happy with my meal.\n\nMy buddy told me a quite sentimental story about getting in there underage, but as we are all old now, I can't vouch for that."
"4","Was in Madison for a show at the Frequency and decided to perform at the open mic here. The audience was lucky because I totally killed. I'm just kidding, but I really did totally kill. I'm joking about how awesome I think I am but the real joke was when I performed here, meaning that I told several awesome jokes that the crowd really enjoyed. A really awesomely attended show and the local performers were really funny. Seriously though, I fucking killed it."
"4","Always a good time, especially with a group. The staff is generally professional, although our last waitress missed my gf's request of water in addition to her drink multiple times.  The comedians can be hit or miss, but if someone out the crowd says something stupid they get ripped up which is always a plus. Not for the faint of heart squares. Loosen up man."
"2","Went here on a recommendation from someone who clearly has never had the kind of Thai food that's so good you may lay down in the road for it.  The food was mediocre, the waiter looked like he was angry and wanted us to die.  The only thing worth mentioning were the potato pockets.  Those were pretty good, but not enough to consider going back."
"3","Passable middle eastern and mediterranean food in a nice State Street setting close to campus."
"2","I come from a turkic background and I look the part so naturally I was greeted in Turkish by the owner (i think?). I'm thinking ok this is going to be a great place, very authentic.\n\nBoy oh boy was I wrong! \n\nMom had the lab kewab, and I had the chicken. Priced very reasonably but I would have been willing to pay a bit more if that means that they can produce a high quality product. Mom said her meat was chewy and hard. I tried a piece and I agreed. My chicken was bland and had a weird texture. \n\nThe rice which is usually so so tasty at middle eastern/turkish restaurants was so lackluster. Sorry Husnus but this food was not authentic in any way."
"1","This is the worst run management company I have come across in several years of renting.  Not only were they unable to manage the radiator problems I alerted the management about all fall/winter, but they refused to offer any type of credit for the inconvenience it caused.  I actually went out and purchased a thermometer to prove that my apartment was unbearable, I was correct at 90 degrees in every room.  All of my stuff was melting (think makeup/deodorant etc...)   The response? Open the window.  Sure thing, in the middle of winter when it is 0 degrees and I am a single female on the first floor. Great solution.\n\nIn addition, it appeared to be a large inconvenience for Mick to submit the appropriate paperwork for me to sublet the apartment. I dealt with several rude and unprofessional emails constantly over the course of the time I lived here.\n\n Would not recommend this company to anyone.  Customer service was awful and I felt there was no alternate to work with."
"2","The crowd is not my scene,  but they make a strong yet decent tasting long Island. the main draw for me was competitive foosball almost any night of the week. its been a few years though."
"1","The Pub isn't a dive bar--it's a shitty bar.  Period.  \n\nIf you want to go to a good dive bar, go to the Paradise or the Main Street Depot, for crying out loud.  Don't go here.\n\nIt's disgusting.  The drinks weren't good.  If it were to be obliterated via meteor right now, I would dance in its ashes.  :p  \n\nTo add to the pleasure of my experience, there were girls doing coke in the bathroom.  Seriously?  You're at THE PUB.  If you're going to do coke, at least go to the Crave Lounge where snorting drugs might still be en vogue."
"1","I have been to Porta Bella several times over the years.  Why I've gone there more than once I just don't know.  I just want so badly to like this place but every time it truly disappoints.  The only thing it has going is the semblance of a romantic atmosphere (although that's really only due to the low lighting).\n\nMy last trip I had the pasta primavera, artichoke and spinach ravioli in a pesto sauce and sauteed veggies.  The only problem was that there were 3 itty bitty raviolis in the entire dish.  Trying to find them was like an archeology dig amongst unfresh and limp veggies.  \n\nNext time you walk past the place do yourself a favor and just keep walking.  The sub-par food and service aren't worth your time or money."
"4","I quite like the place....their entrance is through a quaint-looking garden which sets a romantic mood. The ambiance inside is pretty nice. The food is good. Try the stuffed mushrooms. They can be pretty busy at times so I would call ahead."
"2","I went there for the lunch deals only, but I can't say I'm impressed with the food. Service there is really nice and their lunch portions are filling, but their pasta is very overcooked. It's also a bit dark inside the place, but it's nice and quiet for the most part."
"3","The food was edible, but not incredible. Mind you, it's better than what I can make for myself, but it doesn't stand out. I honestly couldn't tell you whether or not it was expensive because UWIsc paid for our banquet.\n\nHowever, the downstairs basement/dungeon/bar/whatever is a pretty fun place to hang out. The dining area can get cramped and difficult if it's reserved for large groups because there are big pillars that take up a lot of space. This makes restroom trips cumbersome.\n\nBut the flirty and good-looking bartender? He gets 25,000,000 stars."
"2","Growing up in Madison, I have heard about this place for years.  It is with that and Restaurant Week that my girlfriend and I ventured out there last night.\n\nThe environment was great, nice and cozy with a higher class feel. Great lighting and seating arrangement.\n\nThe service was good, nothing bad, but nothing spectacular.\n\nHowever, the point of this was for the food. Sadly, that did not live up to the hype, not even marginally.\n\nThe bread and oil served as a precursor was incredible. The oil was infused with a nice spice that went great with the warm sourdough.\n\nFor appetizers, we had the Italian Stuffed Mushrooms and the Spinach and Artichoke Dip.  The dip was incredible, hot, gooey, with a crusty yet easily broken up bread. The mushrooms left much more to be desired.  Initially, they tasted like a pizza without a crust, but as I chewed, the pepper became overwhelming.  That was the first one.  After that, I could scarcely taste anything but pepper.\n\nOur entrees were a stuffed steak, what I would refer to as a Steak Parmigiana and Stuffed Shrimp with Spinach Fettuccine. The marinara with the steak was ok, most likely homemade, but the steak was overcooked to the point of being tough. And overall the dish was rather bland, even with the sauce and cheese.  The shrimp dish was no better.  The shrimp itself was good, but the stuffing and the white sauce both had little to no flavor. What little flavor that they did have was from the pasta and the shrimp.  The pasta itself was very good, as long as it was sauce free.  It had a great texture, was cooked perfectly, and made me think it was made in-house.  I did not eat most of this dish, which is nearly unheard for me.\n\nThen we had our desserts, a hazelnut gelato with a cream center and a chocolate cannoli.  Both were good, but nothing to rave about.  The cannoli's filling was very rich and it almost made itself less appealing the more I ate.  I'm a chocolate fiend and have had varieties from many countries, so this was new to me.  The cream center of the gelato was a great addition, but was offset a bit by the overabundance of cocoa on the outside.  Again, neither was bad, but they fell short of memorable.\n\nThis meal was mostly bland really.  Short of a couple highlights, it was simply a below average meal.  The one thing that I'd never think of Italian cuisine is bland. Even if you're not a fan of the flavors, they are always there and always intense.  That's part of the draw.  For Porta Bella, it's character-lacking food has persuaded me to look elsewhere."
"4","I liked the funkiness of the interior, though it might not be to everyone's liking. The lighting could sure be improved. \n\nBut you come here for the food, right? No worries there. If you crave the old school steakhouse experience, you will be really happy. First. Attention to detail. Couple of choices on bone-in steaks, which earns points in my book. And radishes in the crudit\u00e9s! Second, they butcher a little bit thicker than the norm. A bone-in Rib Eye was almost 2 inches thick. That's just greatness.  \n\nAs such, portions will seem large. Entrees come with soup or salad, and a potato or vegetable side. They are not meager. Nor are the appetizers. Be really hungry if you intend to order off that menu as well, or be prepared to take steak home. \n\nMeat will come in the desired temp - they executed that really well. Well seared crust. Would have let it rest another 5 minutes myself, but it came out sizzling on a plate.  Care is taken with scallops and shrimp were tender chilled crescents of delight. A bread tray is brought to the table, but it ranges from good biscuits to a mediocre bread machine loaf. They'd be better off buying in from Madison Sourdough. Still, I ate it. \n\nThe wine list is quite competent, if not showy, and that itself is an accomplishment. Servers are about what you find in Madison; folksy friendly but sloppy on the water pour. I enjoyed them regardless. If I could improve on the experience, I'd hire a lighting designer, buy bread out and get a good cleaning service to scrub the floors which seemed a little dingy along the edges. \n\nI'd go back. And definitely ask for the red banquette."
"4","The roasted half chicken = GREAT! The mashed potatoes & green beans were very good, as well. The stuffing was good, but could have been better in flavor. The service was great. The bread options & Caesar salad was delish, as well. No complaints, really. The environment of the restaurant was nice - I love the level of privacy in the booths. The bar environment was very moody, dark, and retro - divine!"
"1","Very disappointing! The steak was overcooked and bland. I ordered the $49 Bone In Tenderloin medium rare- it was delivered medium well. We were the 2nd table to be seated at 5:10. By 6:30, every table around us had been seated, served and had eaten their entrees as we were still waiting for our entrees. When I finally got the attention from our waitress, she was defensive and told us we were wrong as did the host as we were leaving. \nThe bread & oysters Rockefeller were tasty but not enough to be bring us back."
"3","OK place but had better.\nSteak was OK although for the price i was expecting better.\nwe were seated on a table and the seats were small.\nNo parking, had to drive around till i found a ramp (with pay meters) not too far."
"5","What a fun evening. Thanks Bob, Theresa, Dale...and everyone at Tornado Steak House and Corral Room Bar. With so many dining choices in Madison, we were directed to the Tornado Steak House by Wisconsin Supper Clubs by Ron Faiola. Another great suggestion Ron. Owner Henry D has captured the traditional Wisconsin supper club experience with some flair at Tornado Steak House. Relish tray served \""vertical\"" - check. Round \""vegas styled\"" booths for intimate service in the bar - check. Perfectly mulled Brandy Old Fashioned - check. Tornado Steak House is located in the former Crandalls, and named for the infamous Spring and Summer Wisconsin storms that equally capture the attention of locals. Starting with an email and a message/ Facebook - Bob the GM was efficient, communicative and very responsive, working diligently to squeeze us in for a Saturday evening reservation - viola - a cancellation and Bob was quick to accommodate us. We arrived early and sat in the cozy circular booths - graciously welcomed with a Jack and Coke , Brandy and Southern Comfort Old Fashioned(s) - perfectly mulled and served in heavy cocktail tumblers - \""old school\"" - also a couple of Karben 4, Nightcall Porter(s) - served cold and quickly with attention to detail. Appetizers of Escargot and Coquille Saint Jacques - perfectly prepared, the sea scallops are poached in white wine and served with Wisconsin cream - excellent. For dinner, three of us enjoyed the Saturday special cuts of house prepared Prime Rib and the fourth enjoyed a deliciously prepared fillet of Walleye. Dinners were served with a choice of salad - wedge w/ roquefort dressing, mixed greens and vinaigrette, or tossed spinach w/ hot bacon dressing. I had the wedge and thought it was served perfectly chilled with just the proper amount of roquefort and french - tasty. Salads were preceded by the \""vertical\"" relish offering and although our bread tray was forgotten, it was quickly retrieved when we inquired. Entree's were served with the Tornado Steak House famously delicious hash browns - and Yorkshire pudding - correctly executed in their preparation and served next to the nicely seasoned prime. If you are grading supper clubs on location, ambiance, hospitality, service, charisma, food, presentation, \""x-factor\"", and value - I believe you'll find Tornado Steak house will score very high on your scorecard - I know it did on ours. Thanks Tornado Steak house for creating an authentic Wisconsin Supper Club experience that we thoroughly enjoyed. Stop by and visit Tornado Steak House soon, I'll think you'll enjoy the experience as much as we did."
"3","Is the food good? No. Is the service good? Actually, yes. On Monday night my 3 friends and I had several margaritas (because they're 1/2 off!!) and dinner there. The bartender was very nice and the drink was appropriately strong, and the table waiter was also very pleasant to 4 of us. The place was not that happening on this particular night  - I think it's partly because of the holiday emptiness the college town experiences + ultra cold night - so no body was kicking us out of the door in hurry. We stayed and chatted long after taking care of the bills, and they didn't seem to care. \n\nHas the food been authentic or anything close to that, the dining experience would have been a bit more pleasurable on palate, but over all, not too much to complain about."
"2","the outdoor seating was nice.  margaritas were pretty good.  food was not good at all.  So if you want to hang out on state street and have a drink, it's nice.  If you want good food, go somewhere else."
"1","I went in, was seated and told, \""A nice young lady will be with you in a minute.\"" I sat, closed my menu, stared out the window, read from my book, sent some texts. I then watched a couple next to me get seated, and receive drinks and menus. \nI got up and walked out."
"3","I'm happy with CMI for the most part - the maintenance staff in particular is great. I live in an older building, so it has its own set of age-related problems. With every issue I've had, the maintenance staff has delivered. Very pleasant people, too.\nThe office staff can be difficult at times - I always hang up feeling like I've bothered someone or I'm an annoyance. Wish the candor would change. Regardless, my requests are always fulfilled, and I can't complain about that."
"1","I would have given this place 3 stars for okay but not great/good food, but given that I got violent food poisoning after eating here and was up from 1:30am-6:30am vomiting every hour or so, I have no choice but to go with 1 star.\n\nAs a dive bar it seemed cool though."
"1","Not sure how good the food is going to be but 45 minutes to get it is unacceptable. No apologies at all from the staff either. Finally got our food. Not worth the wait.  Skip it!"
"2","I had dinner at Hawk's while visiting Madison during a conference, and I chose it because it had vegetables on the menu, and those seem hard to find behind all the friend cheese curds in this town (believe me- not a complaint). This place is definitely straightforward, no frills, nothing special with the food. My husband and I both got salads, and they were pretty mediocre.   \nAlso, my main disappointment is that the beer menu doesn't list all the beers! I had the bartender recommend something for me, which turned out to be fine, but a few minutes later I saw  a waitress bring someone else the Leinenkugels Honey Wheat that I had been searching for! I saw it listed nowhere on the menu! Ugh! Sadness. \nHawk's served its purpose in providing vegetables, but nothing special here!"
"3","Disappointed. Came in for a late breakfast as many tables were getting up. The dining area was at maybe a third capacity and our two omelets still took 40 minutes. Our server was pleasant enough, the place was clean and our food was pretty decent but I definitely became  \""hangry\"" during that 40 minutes. As far as the price, quality and wait: I would go to Lazy Jane's over Willalby's in the future."
"3","I checked out a review of this place before hitting it up (vegan breakfast fare can be dicey to say the least) and was pleased to see they offer a Tofu skillet plus Vegan Biscuits and Gravy. Because the omnipresent \""tofu scramble\"" is wearing a bit thin, I decided to try the biscuits and gravy because... why the hell not. I was with four hungry dudes who each ordered some variation of eggs and sausage yet they were all drooling when my plate was brought out. Zing!\n\nThe biscuits were suuuper hearty (I couldn't eat again until, like, 7 pm) and smothered in a bland gravy. I loaded on the hot sauce which helped but I still felt they were lacking in flavor. The plate came with hash browns and some chopped tomatoes and broccoli. I give Willalby's points for effort, but my meal wasn't superb.\n\nAs for the guys' meals-- they were hungover and left highly satisfied. I heard that the sausage far surpassed nearby Lazy Jane's and the eggs were done well."
"4","Great diner on Willy Street! Went here after finding out Lazy Janes wasn't serving breakfast (after 11). Willalby's serves breakfast all day.\n\nPancakes are solid, omelette are amazing. Try the Hart's Content! The only thing that kept me from giving it 5 stars was the coffee. Not so good either of the three times I've been there. But very good diner (and cheap!) that I'd recommend."
"3","It's true that Kabul isn't really memorable. But its kabobs are good. It feels like a restaurant on a college campus should ... like it's just managing to get by. It's good food."
"5","The food here is soooooooo good.  I ordered a vegetarian dish and words can not explain how good it was.  Enjoy!!!  Cheers!!!"
"2","Meh. It was fine, but were pretty sure we ordered beef and got chicken. But they ignored the mistake as if it's how the dish comes out. Maybe I'm ignorant to Afghan style beef. Or maybe they were to lazy to fix the issue. Either way they handled it terribly. And the service was lacking. Bleh."
"1","Bait and switch.  They'll let your children participate in creating a craft and then charge you to keep it."
"3","Vegans beware! My vegan friend was just informed that her request for a basic vegetable wrap would inconvenience the kitchen too much and that she should order the veggie burger which has tofu - unfortunately she's allergic to soy. Awkwardness ensued. Eventually they did give her a delicious veggie wrap.\n\nThe hummus was really good - the bread especially was delicious. You also shouldn't miss out on the cheese curds.\n\nI went with the crispy chicken sandwich and added guacamole which was absolutely the right choice. \n\nOverall a solid enough experience - there are definitely better burger joints in Madison but if you're here for Trivia (Thursdays & Sundays) or just to watch a game it's a great spot."
"5","I never stayed in the hotel here, I just visit the bar RIGHT on the lake. It's like you're on vacation when you visit Edgewater's bar. There is no better place (beside the terrace at the student union) to enjoy a cold one in Madison. \n\nService is quick and friendly and they have Spotted Cow on tap :) Their food is pretty decent and the prices are just right. Try a bloody Mary, they give you Spotted Cow as a chaser and the mix is nice and spicy."
"4","Hello, alcohol empire!\n\nRiley's has an amazing selection and a lot of great quality booze. My significant other really prefers this place to the other available places near the campus and I like coming here as well.\n\nThis place is the best for variety, but service here is mediocre at best. However, there's only things you can find here compared to Miller's or the OP, and they know it, so it's a little pricier."
"4","Best selection around, by far. Whenever I am looking for a new seasonal or limited release beer, I come here. If you can't find something, ask the staff. They will either be glad to help, or kind of blow you off it really depends on the day.\n\nPrices are pretty high, considering UAL down the street has a lot of the stuff for a couple bucks cheaper, but I guess you're paying for having the selection. 3 coolers of singles priced $1.49-$2.49 and you get a 10% discount for buying 6 or more. Also the only liquor store near campus that (sometimes) has 40's.\n\nI was originally going to give this place 3 stars, but then remembered they have a twitter feed that is constantly updated with new beer arrivals and recommendations; some businesses don't know how much of an advantage they get just by using social media. Good job on that, guys!"
"4","Love the Mac and Cheese."
"4","Totally fits in with the willy street culture.\n\nLove that a chain name is UNIQUE and actually has familiar faces that you recognize whenever you visit.\n\nYou can get almost everything you want from Ace Hardware Center!! Snacks, drinks, tools, kitchen gadgets, cleaning agents, furniture. Wow, I'm grateful for Willy street Ace hardware!!"
"2","My wife and I went there for a Valentine's day dinner....so my experience may not be typical of an average day. Anyways, here's my bit...\n\nWe had a reservation for 7.30. We were not seated until 9pm....by which time, I had lost my temper, appetite, and the mood for some over-priced, sub-par rack of lamb! The food was barely ok....the tables were too close to each other and we were seated pretty close to the kitchen with a darn pillar blocking most of my view. Guess the window tables might be fun...but I don't think I'll ever go back to find out."
"4","This microbrewery is definitely a centerpiece of Madison's dining and drinking scene.  I'm surprised nobody else has reviewed it yet.  Pretty cool place with frequent live music, a back room with pool and darts and an expansive menu showcasing the best artichoke cheese dip ever."
"3","I'm glad for a local plumbing shop (and I have no reason to think that they are great if you know plumbing), but for a place that claims to cater to DIYers, they seem to go out of their way to make one feel incompetent, refusing to sell a simple 75\u00a2 piece of plastic without a detailed explanation of the project. After four trips trying to get this piece I gave up."
"2","As far as automatic, non-do-it-yourself car washes, this is where you'll get the bang for your buck and a quick wash.  If that's what you're shooting for, this place has the whole routine down!\n\nEven with a basic wash, they'll wipe down the interior and clean the insides of the windows.  That's pretty cool, but they use ammonia-based cleaners to get the residue to evaporate faster.  That's fine when it's used in your house, but prolonged or repeated use of the stuff will dry out the vinyl and rubber seals on your car. \n\nThey janked up all the seat settings (slid them all back) so that they can get in there and wipe the dash.  Again, that's cool given how quick they wipe it down, but annoying.  Even without paying for the stinky perfume, the car still smelled like it anyway.  Eww.\n\nI believe that a DIY car wash (like the place out in Middleton or Sun Prairie) would be a better clean for ~$6, given you have your own sponge, cloth, soap, and bucket.  If you're short on time, Octopus has got your back.  Like Joyce said, it is what it is :)"
"4","This bar is tucked away on train tracks and not quite what is considered \""downtown.\"" But it is the definition of a hidden gem. Mostly a tiny sports bar, you can feel the history here, and you really drink it in...\n\nFood is available, and it's typical bar fare, but just link the drinks, the price is right. They have slot machines, as any classic Wisconsin bar should have. The Long Islands are good, but if the place wants a 5-star rating, they have to upgrade the televisions. Other than that, stop in for any Kohl center event and you won't be disappointed. I don't think it gouges you like any of the Regent bars on football Saturdays, either."
"2","I've been in to Goodman's twice, and neither was a great experience.  \n\nThe first was when my fiancee and I needed to get my engagement ring resized.  We came in with an 18k white gold ring from a well known international maker, and the first person to help us sniffed and said \""we don't work in SILVER.\""  As if we don't know what our ring is.\n\nThe second time I was in trying to pick out a watch.  Maybe if you're in the market for a Rolex this is the place for you.  But the person who helped me thought my budget was plus or minus $500, and they didn't have a great selection in my range."
"4","The Campus Inn is a great option for those visiting the University of Madison campus. It puts you just off of State Street and is easy walking distance or a bus ride from just about anything you might want to see. It was very nice not to have to rent a car while in town for the weekend. You can grab a cab at the airport and they will drop you at the Inn - you pay the tip and the hotel covers the fare. \n\nThe Inn features complimentary breakfast and evening appetizers/desserts. They also have a fully stocked bar. My room was clean, neat, and very comfortable. I did have some difficulty adjusting the thermostat, though, and my room seemed to be perpetually toasty. The weather was fairly damp, humid, and rainy and that may have contributed. Speaking of rainy, the Inn does provide complimentary umbrellas for your use during your stay. The staff was exceptionally friendly and accommodating of requests.\n\nThe Inn is showing its age a bit (paint, wallpaper, and carpet probably need updating) and I found the vending machines to be very inconvenient and difficult to operate. I would definitely ask a staff member to show you how they work before attempting it on your own. The overall feel of the place is very antique almost Edwardian in a sense - dark wood, floral motifs, brass, etc - it is very charming and cozy. They do have free wi-fi which is a bonus. I would certainly consider staying here again when in town."
"2","While the Campus Inn offers quite a bit of charm and while the Inn's lobby has been renovated quite extensively, what really disappointed me was the outdated room that I received and the very flimsy bed and old sheets in that room.\n\nNow, the hotel does offer free wifi, a decent breakfast and a manager's reception, but as a business traveler, those perks eventually come standard with any hotel. On the other hand, the room that I received could have been better.\n\nThe bed was small and quite uncomfortable, and the room had clearly once been a smoking room. The bathtub also did not drain properly. I thought long about calling them to fix it, and just decided that it wasn't really worth it, since I only planned to shower once a day anyway.\n\nIn all, I have a good idea of what to receive given a certain location and price point, and I just felt that at the Campus Inn's price point, given that it's in Madison, WI, it didn't really offer much value for me to recommend it."
"4","Positives:  Right in the heart of everything. \nNegs:  Right in the heart of everything.\n\nClean enough and a bit dated but who goes to Madison to stay in the room? (although I don't want to think about the history of the towels I used).  So if drinking and partying and drinking more and listening to other people outside doing the same is what you are looking for... this room is great especially when you consider you will be blacked out within a few hours of check in."
"3","Although I still believe that the front desk staff at the Concourse have serious communication and follow-up issues, I must say that Customer Service Manager Stephanie LaBella spent about an hour with me on the phone trying to not only get a clear picture of the problems that I experienced but trying to solve them as best she could by taking notes and formulating a plan for staff meetings and updates. She even offered to refund some of my room charges due to poor service. I believe that she did the very best that she could do to help me feel heard and appreciated as a customer and I honor that. I cannot rate the hotel above a 3, but I can rate her service as 5 stars."
"5","The Madison Concourse is really nice, hosting one of the professional conferences I attended. I was allowed to check in early, without calling ahead (I should have), being very friendly about it. Even when they asked to move me due to a heating issues with a conjoined room, they were friendly, nice, and accommodating. I was given a free dinner for my troubles! Thanks!\n\nThe catering and banquet services were also good. They were 4 out of 5 in the food area to me, regarding taste. Service was spot on! All my waiters were professional, nice, and great with accommodating vegans. I felt the waitstaff was managed very well and dressed nice. I LOVED the desserts they had. Last nice there was a dessert reception with gluten options! The food in the restaurant was a bit better and high scale. I had the roasted chicken dish, which was juicy and crispy! Again, the waitstaff and hostess were on point.\n\nThe rooms were nice. Lots of space in my queen, big tv. However, not too many cable channels, but its OK. Free Wifi that worked everywhere I went in the hotel without fail. It was also high speed despite a large conference was going on.  Our conference usually complains about that to our conference committee, but not this year! I had a great view of the Capital building form my window. Fridge, iron, and hair drawer in my room. I was not able to visit the pool, but they do have one. Vending and microwave on third floor with the arcade. Lastly, the pillows here are clouds! \n\nVery nice stay at the Madison Concourse! Great job hosting our conference!"
"3","Good lunch option if you're around upper State Street. While I can't give a spectacular rating for this place, I think it's hard to imagine that lunch here would go a completely disaster. I had Bangkok curry noodle while my friend ordered Japanese noodle - which was interesting cross between udon noodle and yakisoba. I guess that's one of the complaints I hear from other people about this place. They have their own interpretation of Asian noodles, so don't expect anything \""authentic.\""\n\nBoth of our dishes came out very quick from the kitchen. I was very satisfied with the portion, but my guy friend seemed  like he could have bit more on his plate. Nonetheless, both dishes were pretty tasty. I'm kinda curious to try the non-Asian dishes if I ever go there again."
"2","really love the mac n' cheese with meatballs. almost too rich, but the texture of the (pork?) meat provides a nice contrast to the pasta & cheese. portion size is fine for any normal sized society. only gets (a somewhat inflated) 2 stars cause i'd rather just say no to their 'asian' dishes than be disappointed."
"4","Old school, cozy supper club serving up a great fish fry and classic cocktails in Madison! \n\nMy dad and I went to the Avenue on a Friday night around 6:30-7pm for dinner. Parking was somewhat of an issue, but we found a street spot after a few minutes. Thanks to the swag bag from the Yelp Elite event at DLux, we had a buy one get one free fish fry! We only waiting about 10-15 minutes for a table, which was not bad for a Friday night (after reading other Yelp reviews). \n\nOur starters came out quickly. My dad ordered the clam chowder...yum! Large chunks of clam, no salt and pepper needed! My house salad with homemade blue cheese dressing was surprisingly good. Then the fish fry. Nice pieces of cod, the batter was crispy and delicious. Nothing too special about the baked potato or fried. My Brandy Old Fashioned was tasty and strong. \n\nI love the decor and the feel of the place. I'll definitely be back to try some of the other dishes!"
"3","We had shared an appetizer platter and it came with a relish tray (what a great side!).  We were pleased with the cheese curds, but the idea of \""shrimp toast\"" is not what I'd thought it to be.  It was simply shrimp salad with a side of white toast to put it onto.  For my meal, I tried the portobello mushroom burger.  I felt it was better without the top piece of bread.  It was ok, but nothing special.  The mushroom didn't melt any part of the cream cheese so I had two chunks of cheese to finagle.  Because it was someone's birthday, we were greeted with the traveling band singing to our birthday girl and had a small birthday cake to share.  It was a good chocolate cake.  Our server allowed us to separate our bill, so it was very nice to have that ability.  From what I hear, they has a spectacular brunch."
"1","I was very dissapointed with the Avenue Bar. My boyfriend and I went there for dinner. The atmosphere was fine, seemed like a supper club type joint. We expected some delicious classics. I ordered the fish fry and he had the eggplant parmesan. The fish fry was average and the french fries were dissapointing and boring. My boyfriend's eggplant parm was more like a lasgana and was cold in the middle. With a bill that was over fifty dollars for food and one beer, I expected more than just heated frozen food. The dinner was a waste of money. Unfortunately we will not go back. I will say that at least our server was very welcoming and great at his job."
"2","This is a review of my lunch experience.  I had lunch with two friends last week and JDS completely failed on both service and food.  From being seated to the time we got our check was one hour and fifteen minutes.  Really, for lunch?  In fact, one of my guests took about three bites, asked for a box and almost immediately had to take her lunch with her back to her office.  Oh I forgot, my other guest ordered a plain hamburger, well done, on just a bun.  This is how he always orders a hamburger, so he is always very clear with his order, he knows is not common.  Pretty easy, right?  Instead, he gets a cheeseburger with some lettuce.  Wrong!  I got a simple steak sandwich at a steak house, and it was just plain bad.  No flavor, absolutely no flavor.  There was one highlight, the french onion soup.  It was very good.  Overall, an incredibly disappointing experience all around.  I would be very reluctant to go back for lunch."
"2","The clothes, etc, are nice but the people who work here are so snotty!  I just want to say to them, \""You're in Madison, Wisconsin.  This is not Rodeo Drive or Fifth Avenue.  Drop the attitude.\""  I don't need to be treated like scum when I'm out to spend money -- I'll avoid this store from now on."
"1","Won't be coming back.   The food was only mediocre and the service was bad."
"1","Oh, Come Back Inn. You may be a relative of Hotel Rubie Marie, but you are a distant one to say the least. I live a block up from this restaurant, and seeing as I has never been before, I decided to eat dinner here. Before the shit storm starts, let me say that the style of the place is very cool, if not a step back in time to a different social era. It is disturbing to note that there was a very discriminatory atmosphere that night. I was shocked to overhear the lady who manages dismissing gay marriage as a \""fad\""... I actually feared for my safety as the manager seemed to have set a bad tone within the restaurant. The food was pretty good, but I'm afraid that was ultimately meaningless, as  the atmosphere was not accepting of others... This manager has some explaining to do."
"3","German beer hall type place. Dark and woody with lots of stuff on the walls and ceilings. Beer was good and served in a large heavy glass. People were enjoying the bar while the badger game was on, very noisy at times. If you want a German beer hall good time than this just might be the place."
"2","This review is for the new Magnus:\nOld Magnus, why did you go away? And why did you take the tasty chimichurri with you? Coming to Magnus (and paying the bill) is for special occasions. The new, updated Scandinavian menu leaves a lot to be desired. I found a few things on the menu that sounded interesting, but I will be okay without ever going back to try them. The menu is heavy on smoked and salted fish, per the Scandinavian tradition. The focaccia has even been replaced with rye bread. The bread is okay, but it's no where close to comparable. The one thing that didn't change with the Scandinavian overhaul is that the service is still very inattentive. \nMaybe this place would have gotten 3 stars if I hadn't ever been to the old version of Magnus. But I have. And I miss it."
"4","I'm a fan of the Magnus, and I've been itching to try it again since switching over to their \""new Scandinavian\"" menu.  My husband and I went for dinner last weekend, and we were not disappointed.  We arrived relatively early for a Friday night, so we decided to sit at the bar and have a cocktail before moving on to dinner.  We both had speciality cocktails - The Finn's #7 Cup (gin, vermouth, Lillet, and St. Germain garnished with sliced cucumbers and green apples) for me, and the New Style Old Fashioned (Jack Daniels, SoCo, ginger, and gingerale) for the husband.  Both were delicious.  The addition of ginger to the old fashioned gave it a zip that it doesn't normally have.  The Finn's #7 Cup was light and refreshing, and made me wish that it was July instead of November because it was a drink that I think would be best enjoyed out on the patio on a beautiful summer evening.  While our bartender was a little slow, the drinks made up for the misstep in service.\n\nWe ordered the house special appetizer of the night, which was a home cured pastrami made of grassfed beef ribeye prepared as a carpaccio topped with shaved truffles served with homemade crackers, sweet grainy mustard, and I think saurkraut.  The curing of the pastrami was just right - light enough to retain the texture of a carpaccio yet still tasting like pastrami.  \n\nWe had the caraway seared venison with venison carpaccio and the cocoa nib cured wild boar tenderloin for our entrees.  When we ordered, I asked the waitress how the venison tenderloin would be prepared, and she replied that the chef sears it to medium rare.  I usually like my red meat very rare, but I went with medium rare based on her recommendation.   And, while it was medium rare, it was still more well done than I would have liked.  Next time I won't second guess myself.  But the venison carpaccio made up for it.  It was melt in your mouth smooth, and the ligonberry syrup added a nice tartness to balance out all the meat.  However, the smoked gouda-egg flan was cold and gelatinous (in a bad way), and I could have done without it.\n\nThe wild boar was also cooked medium rare, and the cut of meat was perfection.  Perfectly cooked, perfectly seasoned, and perfectly delicious.  I would definitely order it again.\n\nFor dessert we went with the Magnus chocolates and a cheese plate.  The chocolates were your basic restaurant chocolate - absolutely fine, but nothing spectacular.  Same for the cheese plate, although the selection of Carr Valley's Cocoa Cardona to the plate was a nice complement to the rest of the meal.  We also enjoyed a delightful bottle of a bonarda/malbec blend with dinner.\n\nBased on this experience, I'm very happy with Magnus's new menu, and I would recommed the Magnus as a great fine dining option in Madison."
"3","I go there for the basics and accessories. Tank/cami and underwear (those 3/$20 kind) are useful and reasonably priced. Sometimes I see interesting earrings. They are clearly targeting the teens and young 20s (surprise, this is a college town), so you won't find anything \""quality.\"" But if you want casual ok quality/looking pieces, this might suit you. I like the home decor section, though. They do stock the pieces with interesting prints/patterns that are somewhat \""urban.\"""
"3","I don't like this Urban Outfitters compared to the one in Milwaukee. It seems to have less clearance and non-clothing items.\n\nAnd their clearance items are **hardly** even on clearance. I can get shirts at the one in Milwaukee for $5. The clearance jeans hear (in the women's department) were $40. No freaking thank-you. \n\nMy boyfriend though, had a different shopping experience. Select Men's Levi's were on sale for $20 and he got a pair he was content with...\n\nNothing special, nothing horrible, A-OK."
"5","Back when I was at school in Madison, if I wasn't home, in class, or at work, I was at ERC. I mean this in the most absolute, literal sense - people would come looking for me there because, chances were quite good, I would be there. The teas are pretty decent, the espresso drinks are almost always good, and the house blend coffee is delicious. Some might argue that point, but they're just wrong and/or dumb. It's delicious. During the summer, when they offer it, the peach rooibos tea is probably the best tea I've ever had (and I work in a tea shop so I know my tea) - get it and love it. Well, just get it. You will love it.\n\nIn terms of atmosphere, well, it depends what you want in a coffeeshop. Some of the regulars are super elitist hipster types, as are some of the employees. But at least as many of each groups are wonderful people. Did I meet my best friends there? No. But I did meet some cool people to add on Myspace or Friendster or whatever, and I was able to chat with them and have fun. The music is, by and large, great. It's pretty typical indie rock fare, but it's still generally good. If you don't like the stuff on the O.C. (because it's that kind of indie rock) or Pitchfork (it's also that kind), bring your own music.\n\nSo, the food offerings are always an important factor when people come into the place I work, and while I choose coffeeshops based on coffee, I know that not everyone else is the same way. The food is so-so. The cookies and brownies and everything are good, because hello they're cookies and brownies and stuff! They used to have these really amazing peanut butter brownies, but the recipe changed or something - they're not the same. The black and white cookie is so good though! Get that one when they have it. It's like the food version of the peach rooibos iced tea."
"3","Can't beat $2 for a any size latte on Wednesdays.  Small latte?  $2 please.  Medium latte?  $2 please!  Large latte?  $2 please!  You get the idea.  Hint:  I'd go with the large..."
"3","I still stand by the previous review. I do stop by if I am in the neighborhood and need coffee. However, this just isn't a place to hang out on a whim anymore.  It's usually PACKED between the hours of 10 to 6.  Outlets are at a premium. Bring an extension cord AND a power strip!"
"2","Small, crowded, dark, dirty utensils, glasses, mugs, fly-ridden during the summer, stuffy and stale during the winter (8 months people.  8 MONTHS!)  Espresso Royale sucks.  You can't study in here.  Music is too loud, and too many kids keep bumping into your table.   And if you can't study in a cafe, what are you doing there?  Oh, you live on campus and you don't have a car and you meet up with friends close to where you live?  Right.  Not my situation.  So, go figure.  \n\nAnyhow, I hope my next review will be less bitter."
"2","A few of my friends and I were sitting on some chairs outside of this place. One friend bought a bagel from Einstein's and because of how the chairs were set up, we thought the seating was for both places. A waitress came outside and asked if we were going to buy anything and we were a little confused but said no and she said, \""well, you can't sit here,\"" extremely rudely. I understand her request however all she had to do was be alittle bit more polite but she was so rude that none of us will ever go there again. Also, it's not like the seating are was packed and they really needed our chairs."
"4","Oh and get the weird maple candy waffles!"
"4","Fast and tasty sandwiches, good baked goods and soups, and a wide array of micro-brew-y beverages.\n\nThat said, their occasional live entertainment can be irritatingly faux-Joanna Newsom-y."
"5","My favorite sandwich place ....ABSOLUTELY!\nI love their Italian sandwich......also their meatball one....they know how to make it delish without making it soggy with the sauce.\nI think their store on state st is pretty cool...love sitting there and chatting with the wife."
"3","They make good sandwiches. My friendordered a vegetarian sandwich and lo and behold, I liked it, so that says a lot about their ingredients. But, I don't think it's worthy of a lot of return trips. \n \n Better than Silver Mine Sandwiches, but not as good as the Old Fashioned."
"4","Stayed here September of 07'.  Twice.  WTH?!?\n\nYeah some allergic reaction mixed with something viral; made my throat close up and could barely breathe; nearly passed out.\n\nLong story short; the nurses are zero supreme (Number 1) and my private room was bangin'!\n\nThey actually listened to me when I told them I have \""hidden veins\"" and a butterfly needle would suit me.\n\nMy beau, parents and daughter all came to visit and also were pleased at my accommodations.  \n\nGod forbid something else unfortunate should happen to me, but if it does, Meriter is my hospital.\n\nThanks!"
"3","Legit breakfasts and fair prices. Layout is cafeteria-style. The employees are pretty nice. Fair ambiance and lots of windows. Probably good for a snowy day. Good coffee too.\n\nAs other reviewers said, there are better near here, that's why only 3 stars."
"4","I like the new location. I have only tried the coffee & pastries so far but both are still excellent. Monkey Bread, mmm. The new space has a nice cafe feel that looks suitable for just relaxing, lunch or a meeting (they still have meeting space)."
"3","Had them cater an event - food was very good, 2 types of quiche - excellent reviews from all meeting participants.  They did forget to bring a fruit platter - luckily I had ordered enough other food that it wasn't that big of a deal, but still not the best way to make an impression.  The delivery was also quite early - about 15-20 minutes before scheduled deliver time - earlier is always better than late, however with hot food, it creates a challenge...food was nicely prepped though.  I would likely order from them again, but will certainly be double checking the order upon arrival and will stress delivery time."
"3","Note to everyone everywhere attempting to cook tofu:\n\nSPICES.\n\nIt's a tricky ingredient to master, but if you're putting it on your menu you should have something tasty to back it up. Sunprint's scramble = large chunks of flavorless tofu with a few veggies mixed in. The potatoes are dry and lacking. I maintain that the place is worthy of 3 stars because I like the bright new space and I'm willing to go back and give it another try. Overall, I wasn't impressed."
"5","Takara is the best Japanese/Sushi restaurant in Madison easily! If your looking for great sushi at a reasonable price go for the Takara Lunch Special. For two rolls and either soup/salad it is only $9.50 and for three rolls and either soup/salad it is only $12.25, you can not get a whole lot better than that. \n\nThe spicy California roll is by far the best roll available. I have tried getting spicy California rolls at other restaurants since trying theirs and I have never found something that comes even close to Takaras. \n\nTakara is also a great place to go for Hibachi. I love sitting around the table while the food is cooked in front of us. It is great for special occasions whether you are on a date or with a group of friends for a birthday."
"2","The place is mainly eh. The sashimi tastes like its B quality from the supermarket. Go to Red or Unami instead."
"2","We walked in without a reservation as it a spur of the moment \""I don't want to be in the house\"" night.  After a couple of minutes a waiter was flagged down and seated us.  There was a sorority group, prom group and a massive table for a bachelorrette party seated and loud; oh well-no biggie; live it up and have fun.\n\nI order a glass of Plum wine, an appetizer of shumai and the Teriyaki Duo (chicken and shrimp); they ordered a glass of chardonnay & the spicy spider roll.\n\nIt took 15-20 minutes to get napkins and I was 3/4 of the way done with my meal before they got their food.  I got a box and while eating his last piece of spider roll I glanced up and saw something golden.  Let me tell you mi gente, all that glitters is not gold...  I reached over across the table and pulled.  A golden blonde HAIR was in the past piece of Spider Roll.  \n\nNOT OKAY.  Everything runs through your mind, what else did they eat?  None of the staff (that was seen) had any other color of hair except BLACK...  Freaky.  I immediately felt sick and flagged down our waitress, Mia. \n\nI handed her the hair and said, \""this was in his roll...\""\n\nShe apologized a total of three (3) times but didn't offer or ask a manager to offer anything.  The bill came to $44.25 and she was still tipped 20% but I won't be returning.  I'll stick to my regular place."
"5","Good sushi with a reasonable price. Takara is extremely generous with their food and their staff are always very friendly."
"3","I love the margaritas here.  I also like the chips and dip.  This place is best utilized at happy hour, for that reason."
"5","Oh man, oh man! Eldorado is absolutely amazing!! Easily one of the best brunches I've had in Madison.\n\nFirst, let me preface my review by saying that I normally avoid Bloody Marys like the plague. Despite my propensity for alcoholic drinks, it's probably my last possible choice. In fact, I'd probably choose water (ewww) over it.\n\nAnyways, given the massive hype its Bloody Marys have gotten, and by hype, I mean my friends constantly talking about how it's the best thing ever (eye roll)... I decided to give them a chance.\n\nMy Bloody Mary arrived with a sampler of beer (starting things off right already), and was pretty delicious. Of course, it's not the best thing ever like my friends claim, but it was pretty damn good. \n\nThe fact that I highly enjoyed it should say a lot already. It was perfectly spiced, and had enough alcohol to counterbalance the normally overwhelming mix. \n\nFor food, I got their Texas Two Step, which definitely lived up to its name. There's nothing more Texan than two ginormous buttermilk biscuits topped with a fried egg, cheese, bacon, sausage and gravy. I have never had something so delicious, yet so, so terrible for me.\n\nI definitely plan on coming here more often, so who knows, I might even start ordering Bloody Marys elsewhere (yeah right)."
"5","Love this place! Get corn quesadillas!"
"2","I've been here a couple of times for brunch.  And every time, something is sort-of off.  First time, my eggs were way overcooked.  The yolks were hard even though they had said they would do sunny side up. Second time, the potato salad they brought with the main dish was basically flavorless and the potato seemed uncooked.\n\nThere was also a very disturbing art exhibit on display the first time I went there.  And a really big disfigured painting of a head in the bathroom that scared me...a bit inappropriate for a small french cafe on willy street.  They should stick to more benign things.\n\nCute, has potential, and maybe I should try it for some other meal (maybe they're not really cut out for brunch), but I was disappointed overall."
"1","I had heard good things about Bon Appetit being a new-ish local-foods cafe in Madison, and so had been excited to try it.  But we left the restaurant very disappointed.  \n\nFor one thing, there was almost nothing that could have possibly been local in our meals, as far as I could tell.  The majority of the dishes on the small menu featured non-seasonal fruits and vegetables, like avocado and strawberry and tomato.  On top of that, the non-local foods we did have were prepared in fairly bland ways (and such small portions!*), especially given the relatively steep prices (entrees at $19). The food was fine, but given these caveats, really not worth it. \n\nAnd although the service was passable, the fact that the waitress and chef sat and talked very loudly, in the most boring ways possible, about movie trivia through our whole meal (\""have you seen that one movie with that British gal? You know the one who was married to Nathan Lane? Oh you mean the one who won that Emmy?\"")**, made the whole setting very uncomfortable. And because the place was so small and we were the only patrons in the restaurant, we could hear all the clattering in the kitchen and had trouble focusing on our own conversation. \n\nWe will not be returning. \n\n*Annie Hall reference \n**Yes, I realize I offered some movie trivia of my own"
"4","I came in for water and stayed for the food.\n\nThe list of food items is quite small, about 6 dishes, but they all looked good.  I went with a scrambled egg sandwich with a garlic spread, thick slices of bacon, on a homemade biscuit.  \n\nI remember my mom making homemade biscuits one time, but then stopped because it took forever to make.  Boy, did I forget what a difference making biscuits from scratch is!  The bacon was that thick meaty bacon, and not that fatty icky stuff.  It was def hog heaven.  \n\nJust be sure when you're stuffing your face with your biscuit sandwich that your friend doesn't walk by and catch you with garlic spread on your face....not like that happened to me or anything  :)"
"2","The cigars are pretty damn near dried out. Some of their better ones are marked up a bit too high. Really? An Arturo Fuente Hemingway Short Story for 11 bucks?! Tasting Room has them for about 7. Consider than the walk in humidor isn't well maintained, it's certainly not worth the extra $4 they charge for a relatively short/quick smoke.\n\nThe staff is nice, and they have a pretty good selection of smoking tobaccos and wares, but they gotta do something bout dem see-gars."
"5","I've lived in 7 different apartments in Madison with 6 different landlords and everyone pales in comparison to McBride. Need a repair? They've fixed it by the time you get home from work. Easy to communicate with and they keep the pressure off their customers."
"4","I've gone here a few times for waxes and they've always been very thorough and far less painful than other waxing experiences I've had. This would be my go-to place, if not for their prices. The wax I get is advertised at $55 and up. I assumed mine would be $55 or $60. When I walked up to the desk to pay afterwards, my total was $75, before tip. I may have let myself go a bit but this seemed a bit high. It would have been nice to receive a little warning from the esthetician. \""Hey, I had to use extra wax to get everything so this one will cost you a bit more,\"" would have sufficed. After tip, this service ended up costing near $100. Seems a bit high for 15 minutes of their time."
"5","Casa B's has the best pizza in Madison, bar none.  The slices are gigantic, and the crust is absolutely perfect.  I can also recommend the Pasta Alla Nafi, which has a tomato cream sauce, chicken, and artichoke hearts.  Fantastic!  The Junction Road location is much nicer than their old downtown location was, though I really miss being able to walk from the UW campus for a slice."
"5","The Barriques on Monroe Street is really one of the best establishments I've been to. It's really both a wine bar and a coffee shop. It's a great environment for chatting with people, and their coffee is very high quality. Oh yeah, they also have high quality whisky as well that you can get by the drink (not that I ever did, I'm no whiskey patron, but I'm familiar with the good types of it)."
"5","Barriques on Monroe has always been one of my favorite \""office work\"" spots. As a person who works from home, the free parking (next street over!), outlets galore, great wifi connection, tasty coffee and Mediterranean Plate keep me coming in! \n\nBut now--- with the new space, so clean and bright, I'm completely in love! Everything I've ever enjoyed about Barriques but with a face lift! There is now a nice bar area to enjoy a beer or glass of wine and I feel like the tables are less cramped."
"1","The pizza here is like the kind you buy in the freezer section of a grocery store and seriously, I'd rather eat frozen pizza than have pizza here again."
"3","I gave this place three stars for these reasons:\n* good tasty foods. we had thecalamari fritti (fried calamari appetizers), spaghetti carbonara, osso buco (pork shank marinated in some spicy tomato-based sauce with risotto). The calamari fritti is one of the best I've ever eaten in Madison, and I am always picky about my squid.\n* BIG portions, we could not finish everything in one meal, although my husband and I were normally not light eaters.\n* reasonable price, especially since the restaurant is located on State St. and the portions are big.  However, I wish they can serve smaller portions of foods for less price.\n* good bread and relaxing italian ambience\n*a very friendly and good customer service (we got there at 9:30pm and left after the restaurant closed. When I told the waiter I wanted my osso buco to go and I would like some extra sauce if they have any left, the waiter asked the kitchen staff to make more sauce. I was soo impressed with this service)."
"2","Well, now I know why coffee snobs (like me) have nicknamed them \""Charbucks.\"" Horribly overroasted beans make the coffee taste awful and burnt.\n\nSo, why two stars? Well, for the service! It's awesome...seriously. The employees here are great, even if they have to deal with making coffee from super-crappy, stale beans.\n\nIf I'm in a pinch and have to choose between these guys and the horrendous Espresso Royale across the street? I'm going with Starbucks every time. Nice employees will always make me spend my money over an annoying hipster who can't brew a cup of joe worth a damn."
"4","This location is a very good example for what a Starbucks should be.  Usually, the service is good and timely, even if you go during a rush in the afternoon.  The wifi can be hit or miss depending on how many people are using it.\n\nThe reason for the four star rating is the problem that is common to most State St/Campus open areas - the transient/homeless population.  It's not unusual for one table to be taken up by someone's plastic bags or someone to be sitting out panhandling.  It's not Starbuck's fault - you see that at most coffee shops in the area.  There's really not much they can do to control the problem, short of kicking them out.  That's an issue for the city of Madison to deal with."
"2","This Starbucks is always freezing cold in the summer, uncomfortable. But usually, it's comfortable in winter and has a nice lounge upstairs and a second set of bathrooms, which is wonderful. However, today the lounge was freezing cold, causing everyone there to leave on their coats. There is a fireplace that was not lit, so I asked the barista why it wasn't lit, and he said, \""it smells like gas, so we have not lit it this year!\"" It's very cold, and there are lots of nice coffee shops in the area with better coffee and much better food. Really-you can't call a repairman? \nAnd the wifi did not work well."
"4","So I''ve only been in Madison for a short time, but I love coming to this Starbucks. I am not a huge fan of the coffee here, but the atmosphere is wonderful. The staff have always treated me well, and the first time I came here, one of the ladies working treated me as though we were already good friends. A+ to the nicest barista in the world.\n\nThey have both a downstairs and an upstairs sitting area. Downstairs is more like an normal Starbucks, but the upstairs is split into two areas, including a large outside porch area. The inside upstairs has plenty of space with tables and some more comfortable seats (but watch out because it is pretty cold up there) , and the outside has the same. I''ve only experienced this outdoor porch during June, but it is one of my favorite places to go. Also very close to the Union Terrace and the Lakeshore Path if you'd like to walk after grabbing a coffee."
"4","This is one of my favorite Starbucks - not that I drink at any Starbucks particularly often. The location is a big plus, and the workers are always friendly. They are efficient as well - they have to be, considering how much traffic this store gets. If you walk in and see a bit of a line, just know that it tends to move fairly quickly."
"4","This was one of my favourite coffee shops to go to in Madison because it was more inviting than most of the coffee shops present. (I was intimidated by not being \""hipster enough\"" at many of them. They have some food items and there is plenty of seating. What is funny about this coffee house is it seems EVERYONE comes here to work on their laptops...it is rare to find anyone talking. There are couches, which I loved. It is nice to be able to be so relaxed and feel at home without your strung our, high roommates talking to the walls...\n\n...oh you don't have that problem? It is rather frequent in Madison..."
"4","Maduro would be my favorite place to hang in town if it weren't for the smoke.  I know it's a cigar bar, but I don't smoke.  Nevertheless, the atmosphere is super cool and I've always had great service from the bartenders.  Enough good beers to placate the beer snobs (like me), and enough other stuff for everyone else.  Super awesome place to be on an off night when it's sparse."
"5","I'm giving this locally owned spot 5 stars for the simple fact that everyone I've sent there has loved it.  With the amazing rates (forget about inflated prices), proximity to the best food & retail as well as bike path and lake, and free drinks at the Up North this is the spot.  Side note: Scottish band Camera Obscura claims the place is haunted, which is very cool."
"4","Very nice, updated bed and breakfast. Furnishings and architectural details true to contextual history of building. Updated bathroom fixtures, quaint, lovely! I agree with most of the reviews written here. The noise from the pub can still be heard on 3rd floor. (Thankfully,, I had the 3rd floor room.) Street noise from morning rush hour traffic is discernible as well. Big deal if you're a light sleeper. Yes, the wi fi connection is not the greatest at this venue, SSID signal seems to fade in and out. Overall, a pleasant inn."
"5","My husband and were driving from Chicago to Madison for a concert and were looking for an inexpensive place to spend the night. Not only was the Ruby Marie the least expensive hotel within walking distance of the Majestic Theatre, but it had a charming atmosphere, everyone was friendly, and we got two complimentary drinks to the adjacent bar and two free breakfast entrees and beverages at the neighboring restaurant. Definitely the best deal in town. My only complaint was that the radiator was making loud rattling noises (if it wasn't the radiator, then it was something outside). However, I definitely plan to stay here again the next time we're in town."
"3","This place is OK.  Shoes must be taken off before you come inside.  Staff was really, really friendly and that was nice.\n\n\nRooms are RIGHT by the kitchen which can be annoying/noisy.  Also gets FREEZING in here at night."
"4","A while back the two Marigold owners started a seemingly Madison revolution in cuisine and I've loved going ever since.  I love the care they take with the food and the fun and friendly atmosphere.  If only it weren't so chaotic and crowded, but why should I think such a great place wouldn't get noticed?"
"4","I was surprised to find out that this was a super casual place to eat. One of those places where you order at the front, grab a number, find a spare table, and wait as the servers find you and bring your food. Bottomless coffee is self serve. \n\nThe blueberry pancakes are really fluffy and eggy. The batter itself isn't sweet and the stack of three is topped with powdered sugar and rolled oats. Yum. The oats really do it for me. Is this is Midwest thing or have all the gazillion breakfast places I've been to on the West Coast just happen to not to that? \n\nWe also got an egg white omelet with artichokes, topped with a smidge of asiago. The marigold potatoes on the side were good but like most other patrons, we barely finished. I also appreciated how lightly they added vinaigrette dressing to the side salad. \n\nI wish this place was cleaner. And the bussers faster. We had to flag down a busy busser/server to wipe our table. Atmosphere was your standard organic-feeling breakfast place but nothing stood out. I liked Cafe Soleil's setup better."
"4","Marigold just started Sunday brunch a few months ago which is great since they used to only be open for Saturday brunch.   My favorite brunch dish there is the salmon, chive, and cream cheese omelet.  The breakfast egg sandwich is really good too (it has boursin cheese on it).  I've been there for lunch a few times, and have enjoyed their salads as well.  The only thing I've had there that I didn't like was their bloody Mary, it tasted too much like celery for my taste.\n\nIt tends to get really busy and crowded on Farmer's Market Saturdays, but I've usually been able to get a table while a friend waited in line to order.  Even when I've had to wait in line to order, the atmosphere and service has always been cheerful."
"5","I loved this place.  Our son, Andrew, and girlfriend, Sara, took us here to enjoy a wonderful breakfast on our recent trip to Wisconsin.... Everything they had here was delicious and I hope to get a chance to go back some day.  It was definitely worth the wait to get in.  I had the strawberry pancakes with marscapone cheese and I will dream about it now."
"5","If you want the perfect breakfast, well this is it.  It's so busy because it's delicious."
"1","This is my first time in Madison and my first restaurant we visited.  Well if my experience at marigold kitchen is what Madison is about....this will be my last visit here.  When we approached the counter we were immediately treated as though we were NOT welcome.  I felt more like an inconvenience then a customer.  When we sat my food arrived 15 minutes before the rest of my table did so I ate cold food.  Marigold kitchen...you should be ashamed.  I would recommend McDonald's before marigold kitchen. Don't know the name of the pregnant woman who initially helped us but sounds like she makes a habit of treating customers poorly."
"4","Been there many times since it opened 13+ years ago.  Don't recall any disappointments.  Their fried breakfast potatoes are so so good.  Today I have a fried egg and ham sandwich with frisee and the combination of flavors and textures was superb.  My wife had chile poached eggs (which I have had in the past and loved) and she loved them (and the potatoes of mine that she poached from my plate).  I don't think you can go wrong here.  It can get crowded but I've never had to wait for a table.  Parking on the square is free on Sundays, so that's a reason to go on Sunday vs. Saturday when the Farmer's Market makes it extra crowded."
"4","You either \""get it\"" or you don't at marigolds. My mother, a visitor to our fair city, deemed marigolds to be too crowded at 1130 on a Sunday morning. She has never seen it at 930 on a Saturday morning. Once my parents initial shell shock of the hustle and bustle around us wore off, we were able to score some seats and wait for our breakfast.\n\nIf you know me, I am a Bloody Mary snob. That bing said, the bloody I had at marigolds was delicious. The mix and seasonings used in the mix were balanced well, and I could sense just the right amount of vodka without it being overpowering. \n\nBetween all of us that went out for my bday brunch, I must have tried just about everything. From the scones, to the daily scrambler, to the pancakes, to the French toast, to the quiche, to the breakfast Sammie that was on special that day, everything was great.\n\nMy qualm? The coffee. It was exceptionally bitter. And I am a lover of bitter and sour tasting things. Something was just...off. These things happen.\n\nWe got in, we got seated, we got served. Great bday brunch in an adorable, brightly lit restaurant."
"3","A very unique menu with a lot of out of the box breakfast options. I had the chorizo omelette and it was delicious, but the potatoes stole the show. Crispy and very flavorful. A friend had the duck hash and that was great, but the scrambler and the bacon omelette were a bit disappointing to the others dining with us. They serve bloody Marys during brunch and those also weren't great...especially at $7 each\n\nThis is a restaurant where customers order at the counter and serve themselves for drinks/coffee then are given a # and a member of the staff brings your food out. So, not full service and it can get busy making finding a table tricky.  \n\nOverall, it was decent but pretty expensive. For two of us, our meal was $45 (including one cocktail). Pretty pricey for \""just OK\"" food."
"3","We wandered in early on a Saturday with no idea how this place worked, so I waited in line to ask and understood that  you order, tell someone (no idea who) how many are in your party , and then you wait.     Meanwhile my husband sat himself at the counter.  This was the wrong way to be seated,  but he wasn't moving.  I went to get his order, told a random person there were two of us, then went back to place the order, completely misunderstood my total bill, apologized, paid, and got a number.  Then I got coffee, which I REALLY needed that morning.   \n\nThe food was delivered to us more quickly than I expected, and my omelette was excellent.   We ate and got out in record time because you just don't want to linger here.  It feels cramped.     Also note that it is not a cheap breakfast.  A side of bacon was $9.  It was very good bacon....but it was $9."
"2","CHOAS!!!! Complete and total CHOAS.  People crashing into each other, food falling on the floor, drinks spilled constantly. The food was good but the place was HORRIBLY managed or better yet completely UNMANAGED. No thanks not again. Tried the zucchini pancakes and they were good experience was awful."
"4","Probably my favorite brunch spot in Madison. You can always expect to wait at least 15 minutes at Marigold, because they serve food in style similar to Panera (wait in line to order & pay, wait at table for food), and the line always reaches to the door. It's worth the wait.\n\nI usually opt for the breakfast sandwich option, which is different depending on when you go, since Marigold has a rotating menu. The sandwiches are always amazing, though the accompanying potatoes are just okay. It's usually enough food for me to take something home. I've also tried the scramblers a few times and have never been disappointed.\n\nThey have delicious iced teas and other gourmet drinks to sip on while you wait for a table. Tables are available on a first come, first serve basis, so it's probably not a great spot if you're with a large group, since you could end up waiting quite a while."
"2","The atmosphere is so so...everything feels just a little be grimy and dirty.  The air always feels a bit dank and stagnant.  More importantly, they aren't particularly good with their espresso drinks.  \n\nI have had a few cappuccinos here and all of them have been too hot with total separation of foam and drinkable beverage.  The key to a decent cappuccino, besides pulling perfect shots from excellent beans, is using freshly poured milk every time, and frothing such that it becomes a perfect drinkable foamy consistency.  Additionally, heat is the enemy here: as in don't pull your shots too hot and don't overheat your milk!  Barista's that know how to pull off designs on the top of espresso drinks almost always know what they are doing with the rest of the drink.  Suffice to say that the folks at \""Thieves\"" could really improve in all of these areas."
"4","The food and service are both very good, I do however wish they where open later on weekdays with me being a 3rd shifter the options can be somewhat limited.  I do appreciate that they have no problem calling when the driver arrives."
"3","I live nearby this place and have had MANY bagels over the years. Over time, my standards have changed and I now get them rarely. These are not as good as a New York bagel. The texture just isn't right and the bread doesn't have the kind of flavor you get with well fermented doughs. \n\nIf you need to get something for an office with 25 people, this is a good cheap option. But for a bread fix, there are better options."
"1","Subs so slow you'll starve before they get there. This location in particular is literally only two right turns right down Mineral Point Road (less than a mile on the same street!) to my workplace, yet it is always an average of 40 minutes before I get my delivery order. How is that even possible? I could walk there faster than that. I always have to remember to order my lunch well before I'm even hungry for it. If my work was in a weird location, I guess I could understand, but we're literally right down the street from them. \n\nI love that JJ has online ordering but this location has to step up their game. Their \""Subs so fast you'll freak\"" motto is a joke. If I could give this location less than one star, I would."
"3","Speaking as someone who does not eat meat ever/very often, I am not impressed with the food as my options are extremely limited.  I am impressed with the atmosphere and beer selection. If  I lived closer, I'd hang out here."
"1","I have to say, I don't get it. \n\n$30+ for bread, a mediocre salad, veggies, soup, horrible prawns, a poor baked potato and a half decent steak in Madison? There has got to be better steak for cheaper elsewhere... \n\nAnd table salt and table pepper? Sorry, but if you're trying to be serious about meat, you've in the least got to have some sea salt and freshly cracked black pepper. \n\nThe beer selection was OK, but you can get the same stuff elsewhere at places that have better food.\n\nI don't know... I've heard that supper clubs are big in the Midwest, and that this place offers a quintessential experience, but maybe I'm just too much of a urbanite-city boy-hipster to enjoy this."
"2","A great restaurant if you are a senior citizen who is not on a limited budget!  We are not senior citizens and were not impressed.  \n\nWalking into the restaurant it was dark and uninviting, my instinct has always said that if an eating establishment keeps it as dark as it was in Smoky's Club they are trying to hide how dirty the place is.  We also found that we were the YOUNGEST people in the restaurant...me being in my early 30's and husband in his early 50's.\n\nThey brought an array of veggies which reminded my husband of when he was a child and went out to eat, so they are keeping up that old school atmosphere.  \n\nThe bread basket was very pleasing with a nice variety and good flavors.  Soup of the night was a clam chowder, good flavor but out of my entire cup of soup I got two tiny (tiny!) pieces of clam.  We both ordered the broiled walleye, my husbands was perfect, mine was raw and had to be sent back and rebroiled...it was much better when it came back to me the second time, still nothing to jump up and down about, but good.  Excellent portion sizes (aka, they did not skimp on the fillet size)\n\nAs I stated in the beginning this is the perfect restaurant if you are a senior citizen with money to spare...if not, don't waste your time or money!"
"5","Brennan's is a top notch market.  They offer a wide variety of fresh fruit and vegetables all year long, bread from local bakers, a full meat counter, and a large outdoor gardening area in the summer.  There's an extensive wine and liquor store in back, with a knowledgeable staff to help you navigate.  To top it all off, they carry an insane variety of cheese, much of which you can sample - get your squeaky fresh cheese curds here if you missed them at the Farmer's Market."
"5","Great meat selection. best in madison hands down"
"4","I couldn't ever make this my only grocery stop because it doesn't have the variety that I need from a grocery store, but man does it have some delicious food! \n\nNumber one is the produce.  Loads of fresh produce, and samples for you to taste before you buy. ....or you know, snack your way around the store...\n\nThey also have a pretty amazing cheese section.  Mostly Wisconsin cheeses with a few other specialty cheeses as well.  I am not a cheese expert and have gone there looking for something kind of specific and was able to have someone knowledgeable enough to point me towards what I was looking for and telling me why certain kinds would or wouldn't work for what I wanted them for. \n\nThey also have a pretty amazing beer section.  Lots of unique local selections, and also something that they seem to be pretty knowledgeable about when questions come up. \n\nThere are other things they sell as well, snacks, meats, seafood, and some other random frozen items.  You can find quite a bit of Brennans branded local items, as well as a few other local brands.\n\nI don't get here often because it isn't a one stop grocery shop, but when I do go I wonder why I don't come more often because I always find such great things!"
"1","I had very \""interesting\"" experience today. 6 days ago schedule appointment online for 7:30 a.m. for oil change.  I got here at 7:30 a.m., waited for 15 minutes in line. Then front desk person Justin told me that is no any technicians until 8 a.m. Waited for 15 minutes more. Then tech showed up and pulled my vehicle inside. I tried their coffee - very funny taste, reminds me a coffee from Sri Lanka I had once on vacation a while ago. Tastes like it was brewed couple days ago and they warm it up for me this morning. But it was great morning and I don't believe everything was bad in this shop. FREE WI-FI!!! After oil change, they adjust/check my tire pressure and tpms tire pressure sensors stopped working. Front desk person said it's my vehicle computer malfunctioning... What a coincidence. Never had any problems before. I will study this problem more and ask my friends for advice... Great Friday morning, looking forward to weekend."
"5","I don't live \""close\"" to a Whole Foods (I'm south side Indy-they are north side Indy), but I go when I need some quinoa or to grab some lunch if I am in the area. I needed some quinoa, was driving by, so I stopped, even though I am not from Madison. With the Yelp check in you get a free small bag. .They were out of the small, so I got the next size up. Yay! I would have even paid the $.20 difference. Yay for good customer service!!!"
"3","The bagels are awesome. Super chewy(in a good way) and many varieties to choose from. My favorite is the Rosemary Olive Oil. AMAZING. The breakfast sammy with turkey sausage is a great, filling, easy start to the day. The best part of this sandwich is the magical way it always stays together. There's no AWOL egg sliding down, or mysterious juices ruining my shirt. So if you're in a rush and have to nosh in your car--go for it. \n\nThe not so awesome? The service. it's not bad. it's just not...good. I always feel like the employees are like \""Okay. You're here. I'm here. Let's get this done.\"""
"3","Eh.  Very big eh.  \n\nWe've been here twice.  I've had the chicken with black bean sauce, and the mushroom chicken.  Both were your average americanized chinese slop.  Not that I don't enjoy that, or think there's good or bad in that genre (heck, I grew up on that shit, and when it's good, it's pretty frickin good), but this wasn't very good.  The lady had a curry chicken, and it was that same yellow curry chicken you get anywhere else.  \n\nNot bad if you think 6 or 7 dollars for a very satisfying portion of chicken and rice is good for lunch.  I'm cheap, so I don't.  But that's just me.  \n\nAs far as the proprietress being rude?  Didn't notice anything like that either time."
"5","Best Chinese food in Madison  by far. Friendly staff and quick service!  They carry a wide selection of both traditional Chinese food and American Chinese food."
"5","HANDS DOWN most authentic Asian cuisine my hubby Andi have found in Madison!  Congee love! The chicken was moist and tasty, so good!"
"1","The food was excellent.  If you can overlook the apathetic hostess/waitress, who was totally put out that we failed to make a reservation, even though the entire eating area was empty, and her horrid customer service, by all means - go, check it out.  We each ordered a glass of wine, which was finally delivered to the table 15 minutes after our food arrived at the table.  Nothing like sitting with water and three rounds of pita for 45 minutes.  We asked 3 different people for the wine, including the waitress.  Loved the food, there's nothing like it where we live and we were excited to check this restaurant out after seeing it on yelp.  You're only allotted 3 small  pita rounds at any given time - God forbid you ask for more, they acted like there was a pita famine in Madison.  The waitress never checked on us, never asked if the food was good, never asked if we were done and if we wanted a box.  We finally had to flag someone else down and ask for the check.  When she brought the check, she slammed it down on the table and stormed off.  There appeared to be several regulars here, eating out on date night - she seemed at least mildly interested in them.  We own a business, and I would never for a minute consider treating people that way the staff at this establishment did.  It was appalling."
"3","Sought this place out because it was across the street from my hotel, but was pleasantly surprised by the service and tasty entree.  I'm not a fish person by nature, but after a long day of tasting cheese I wanted a relatively light dinner and ordered their halibut - served over flavorful mashed potatoes with an awesome creamy (but not heavy!) sauce.  The fish was tender, flaky and moist, really nicely done.  \n\nThe goat cheesecake dessert was a lovely cheesecake, but unfortunately drowning in a far too sweet cherry sauce.  I wondered if this was to smother the goat cheese flavor in the dessert - but if someone doesn't like goat cheese, maybe they just shouldn't order the GOAT cheesecake?  \n\nThe wine was lovely although it cost twice as much as the one I thought we had ordered... either myself or the server was not watching my companion closely enough when he ordered it!"
"2","I recently wanted to treat a friend to a Lombardinos dining  experience. It was about 7:15 this past Friday night so I thought I'd call to see if there were any reservations available. I started from downtown and attempted three different times- no one ever answered the phone and I was sent to voicemail to leave info for a reservation callback. I decided to take a chance that there'd be a table or at least a spot at the bar for two. We arrive to find a busy dining room, not full by any means and an almost empty bar. We were told there were\""like 50 more people coming in\"" for the empty tables but we could sit in the bar. We took seats at the bar and I tried to order two peroni's. We were told the keg blew earlier and apparently they hadn't changed it yet as I can't imagine you wouldn't have an extra keg of Italian beer going in to the weekend. We settled on specialty cocktails and got our first sips in when the hostesses told us there was a table in the dining room we could have. We happily moved and took a look at the menu. While tempted by a number of items I decided on the classic eggplant Napoleon and inquired if I could substitute the long spaghetti for penne or another short pasta. I was told by the waiter that I could have fettuccine, linguine, or bucatini as you didn't offer any short pastas except Orchietti-I thought I was in an Italian restaurant...strike one-no Peroni, strike two-no short pasta...really? I settled on the eggplant with a side of bucatini and my dining partner ordered the bucatini pasta as we waited for dinner to arrive. The plates arrived, steaming hot and piled high swimming in a dark, over cooked tomato sauce-I cut into the \""Napoleon\"" of eggplant only to find that the former thin slices of eggplant, layered with sauce and cheeses had been replaced with an unpeeled slab of aubergine-approximately 2\"" thick and raw in the middle, I cut around the edges and ate as much as possible and moved onto the second piece which was completely undercooked and bitter.  I ate the bucatini, studded with raisins and wondered if the waiter would ever return. When he did he snatched our plates up, never inquiring as to why all the eggplant was still in my bowl and asked if we'd saved room for dessert- strike three-raw eggplant and an adulterated Lombardinos classic-sadly I'll never spend $17 again for two slices of raw eggplant and a handful of pasta smothered in red sauce-net cost probably less than $4.\nToo bad as you were one of the few almost traditional Italian restaurants in town-Francesca's has you beat and that's a sad state of affairs!"
"4","Lombardinos is a good family place to go..Lombardinos service/staff is ok...The food is good though when we ask for crispy pizza they never give us crispy pizza but it is still good!!The Pasta is nothing wowing also the calamari is good...If you want to go to a nice pizza family restaurant u should go to Lombardinos!!!"
"3","I had dinner here with a friend and the food was okay.  I had the panang curry with chicken which was alright.  It wasn't oily like other panang curries I've had at other thai restaurants, however, it was a lot more peanutty than what I expected.  Also, they could use more chicken in the dish especially when you have to pay more for the meat.  Service was alright, we didn't have to wait long for a seat and got our food and drinks quickly.  Wouldn't mind checking this place out again.  The prices were not bad at all."
"3","I've been a fan of New Seoul since I moved to Madison. \n\nThe bibimbop is very good. The pulgogi is also very good, but could be cut up a bit more before serving. The portions are a bit large for chop sticks.  The kimchi is very good! I am not a huge fan of the various stir-fry dishes they offer. I had the chopchebop once and have never had it again since. The other stir-fry dishes are OK, but I'm a fan of the bibimbop and will probably only ever order that again. \n\nThe atmosphere of the restaurant leaves something to be desired. The bathroom is often dirty and awkward to get to. The service is usually good, but sometimes the turn-over of the staff seems a bit high and the quality of service suffers. All in all, it's a good place and not too pricey."
"2","The only reason why I go to this place is because it's the nearest Korean restaurant to Madison college campus.  I always go for their Bibimbap on Rock which is the best meal there, in my opinion.  The potato side is really good too!!"
"5","If you got hair color problems this is the place to go and Betsey is the person to go to. This is the 3rd time in many years that I have gone to her to fix a bad color. I tracked her down from the other (not out of business, William Jon salon on the square). This time she cut my hair and did a wonderful job. She never makes me feel bad for what I did and she is willing to work with us who can't afford regular salon coloring visits and attempt to do it ourselves. She has been in the business 50 years and she knows her chemistry. I hear she is great with African American hair as well. Check her out."
"4","Nice to see that Panera is the same here in Madison WI. Good quality food, very nice employees. This is a fairly busy location but they move people through rather quickly."
"3","I just starting really enjoy going to Panera Breads. I was originally not a fan of their food but thanks to my co workers, I really like dropping by for a nice lunch.\n\nThey have a large variety of foods to select from for all meals if the day and even snack. I am a fan of their strawberry chicken salad and Asian chicken salad. However, the only salad dressing I care for is the dressing that comes with the Asian chicken salad. I think the other dressings are far too tangy. \n\nThis specific location is great because it's easy access for people who do not drive but leave in the area. There are plenty of buses that makes stops directly in front of the restaurant . One thing that I do wish for is them adding more outlets. I like to sometime  bring work and my laptop with me when I dine inside. However, thy have hardly any outlets for charging electronics.  Because of that, I often leave earlier than I would like because my battery starts to run low. This could be done on purpose from Paneras end because they don't want people to overstay their visit as finding seats can be problematic. They do offer free 2 hour service wifi. If too many people are connected, you may get booted or have extremely slow service.\n\n\nI really would give them a 3 stars. I reserve  4 & 5 stars to high end restaurants only but I really do enjoy their food and beverages. Good spot!"
"1","I do not recommend this place for lunch.\n\n\nService - Average\n\nEmployees are friendly and competent, doing their jobs in a way that is expected.\n\n\nFood - A waste of money. I wish I could get a refund.\n\nThe bread was hard, chewy, and tasted woody...like it would have been a tender crusty bread four days ago that was then left uncovered in the sun...\n\n(They keep their bread loaves uncovered, on a shelf, by giant windows where the sunlight beats down unhindered...I guess that should have been a warning sign.)\n\nThe dill spread could easily have come in a budget tub from a grocer.\n\nThe red onion slice was okay, though it's really hard to screw up raw onion. Sadly, you don't gain points for slicing an onion.\n\nThe paper thin slices of cucumber were pointless, their flavor overwhelmed by the salmon & spread, and cut too thin to be crunchy.\n\nThe small pieces of salmon were okay, though nothing exceptional. You can get similar fare from your local butcher.\n\nThe side salad... ... ... wtf did they put on these greens? It tasted like bitter vinegary dish water.\n\n\nPortion size - Small\n\nIt's acceptable as a very light lunch.\n\n\nOver all, the salad sucked, the bread blew and the rest left me unimpressed. If I'm paying $8.50 for a small open-faced (and therefore basically only a half) sandwich, it needs to be organic, local and mind blowing amazing.\n\n\nAtmosphere - Corporate / Faux - Indie\n\nRandom second hand tables, though most had their own set of matching chairs.\n\nSunlight from the large windows lights the place up, but be aware of where you sit to avoid excessive sun glare.\n\n\nJust a side note. Their website claims their chef  \""draws inspiration from local, sustainable, and seasonal ingredients.\"" This is not the same as actually *using* local, sustainable and seasonal ingredients. I dislike it when restaurants use B.S. marketing manipulation. Only their bread and beverages include local ingredients, and not even 100% like they imply."
"5","Great vibe with too many great choices. I had the Frarattoo and would highly recommend it. Very rich and savory grain dish with poached egg. Great baked goods as well."
"5","By far, the best pizza pies in Madison. Their crust and sauces are exceptional. This Italian joint is decidedly old school. Cheese is spread and calories and fat phobes are not spared. \n\nMuch of the staff is young, but are all friendly enough. However, you don't come here too feed your ego ... just your face. \n\nRosati's has a massive menu, but you cannot go wrong with any of it. In fact, if you order their sensational Italian sausage, you can't help but go right. \n\nEat up and leave your calorie counter at home ... or else it may explode."
"4","I had always resisted going to Rosati's because they don't usually have any seating available, so imagine my surprise (and delight) when I found out that this Rosati's (on Mineral Point) did indeed have seating and full wait-service!\n\nWith the first \""blizzard\"" of 2009 breathing down our neck, we ventured over to Rosati's to try their pizza.  Folks at work raved about it, so we set our expectations high.  We arrived and were pleased to discover they were open and that they did indeed have plenty of seating (6 large booths, a few tables, and a bar to sit at).\n\nThe waitress invited us in and told us to sit wherever we'd like.  As we were sitting down, she brought us complimentary popcorn, along with the menus.  Tonight's special was fried chicken, but we opted for the double dough meat lover's pizza.  We added a Miller Lite and a couple of sodas for good measure.\n\nPizza arrived; it was h-u-g-e.  Their \""large\"" is closer to an extra-large if you'd ask me... We took our first bite, and - yum.  The cheese was fantastic - very flavorful, great texture, and perfectly proportioned.  The toppings were tasty as well - fresh and flavorful.  The sauce had just a hint of a kick, which was a pleasant surprise.\n\nI'm not sure that I'd order the double dough crust again (they have thin, double dough, Chicago style, and stuffed); I'd probably try the thin, as the double was just a tad too bready for my liking, but that's really nit-picking on my part.  \n\nThe service was absolutely awesome - our waitress checked-in several times, made sure our drinks were always full, and followed up at the perfect intervals.  Top notch, for sure!  We will definitely be back.\n\nRosati's = WIN\n\nService = 5 stars (fantastic!!! friendly and helpful)\nFood = 4 stars (very solid pizza)\nValue = 4 stars ($26 for large pizza + drinks)\nMIsc = 4 stars (great menu variety, nice seating area)\n\nSummary: It's not often that you get great service from a pizza place, let alone a place that specializes primarily in delivery and carry out.  Combine Rosati's awesome service, huge menu, their delicious pizza, and the great overall value and you can't go wrong."
"5","Most know Rosati's for pizza and take out, but they have so much more including an eat in dinning room.  There pizza is great, but you also need to try the ribs and fries, chicago hot dogs, and pastas.  They have dinning room specials every night that are an incredible deal!"
"1","Worst service EVER! We sat down at a dirty table (because all the tables were dirty) around 12:15 pm. We ordered margaritas on the rocks WITH salt. We got no salt so we waited another 5-10 mins for our salted margs. Then we waited for our order to be taken for about another 10-15 mins while our server was standing next to the kitchen. Well, we ordered and it was NOW 1:57pm and our food was still not to our table. One of us had ordered nachos and at 1:57 they came to tell us they were out of tortilla chips! Are you joking???? That's something they should have known from first hand! I will NEVER go back! I've worked in restaurants since I was 15 and I've never seen any sort of thing like this before! We were not the only table waiting for our food that long either....."
"1","Awful. Percy's on Monroe St. had our van for over a year and a half - that's right, 1-1/2 YEARS!! Lied about working on it. Lied about getting parts. Had it sitting outside in snow and rain to rust away. Finally, my husband figured out what it was and he ordered the parts after they said it was difficult to find fuel injectors. My husband found them with no difficulty. Would not recommend this place. Sure seemed like they were up to something nefarious or just completely incompetent."
"4","Michael's is my favorite dessert-type stop in Madison. You see ice cream, gelato, sorbet, and frozen yogurt all over the place. But frozen custard is a superior breed of dairy goodness.\n\nI never get tired of Michael's custard. They offer many mixes and flavors, and each one can quench your cravings. It's pricier than ice cream, but that's because, again, frozen custard is superior."
"2","My nephew who lives in Madison LOVES this place so we keep going but I have to say that other than sitting outside, I don't get the appeal. The flavor options are incredibly boring- every time we go there it's just chocolate and vanilla and then a \""guest\"" flavor (on Monday it was Espresso). The people who work there are not very friendly or welcoming and generally don't have a grasp of the English language. On top of it, I'm not at all clear what kind of ingredients are being used. If my raspberry shake was in any way natural, I'd be surprised. There were no seeds at all (usually a good sign of authenticity) and it tasted a bit chemical. Is the milk hormone-free? I don't know. That said, it's a cute little place that attracts people of all ages and on this most recent visit, we learned about K-9 Custard, which our dog absolutely devoured (it's $2.75, so make sure yours is hungry!). Anyway, I wish I could give more stars but I have to be truthful- I have had much tastier and interesting ice cream/gelato experiences than this custard stand offers."
"1","I've been out in California for the last three years, but I lived in Madison back when Bluephies first opened in 1994, and have sampled it pretty regularly over the various chef/menu changes.  The last time I came here for dinner, it was a pleasure. I associated Bluephies with fresh local greens, unique flavors that favored aioli and tapenade over mayo, and especially over-the-top breakfast yumminess.\n\n Alas, whatever's happened to dinner in the last year and a half, is totally depressing.  My fiance, my mother, and my two stepkids and I went the last night (8/11) we were in Madison before flying back here.  I ordered an apple chicken walnut salad sandwich, which used to be a pretty awesome blend of aioli and a locally baked croissant with mixed greens, with an interesting presentation.\n\nWhat I got, was something substandard to the airport food that we had at Denver International Airport, and more expensive to boot.  The chicken salad was totally overwhelmed with mayo, the lettuce flabby, and the croissant one of those commercial flabby affairs.  The kids menu dinner items were horrifying; the cheese quesadilla and pizza were microwaved and pretty darn tiny.  My mother's the most forgiving person when it comes to restaurants, but her salmon wasn't good either.  My fiance's meal was totally over-mayoed as well. \n\nThe waitress staff were good, and one waitress who had been there for 2 1/2 years said that it wasn't what it used to be.  And when we complained about the quality of the food, they took off one plate from the price.  I know times are tough, but even out here people have the sense that if you want people to try to get you to ever come back, you should comp the whole meal, or at least offer a free dinner the next time around.\n\nI've used Yelp a bunch of times to check out restaurants ahead of time, but this meal inspired me to actually start up my own account."
"4","I love this place- esp. the breakfast. I started out with a Fat Boy bloody mary. It has bacon. And string cheese. Yum. I ordered the crab Benedict and it was delicious. My dining partners ordered the Denver scramble and prime rib hash. Both said their meals were great. We ended the meal with cookie dough egg rolls. They are evil, but soooo goood. My usual favorite dessert is their 6 layer carrot cake. One thing to remember is that the wait on Sunday morning is long. Do not walk in and expect to be seated in less than a half hour. They have a lounge area where you can get drinks while you wait which makes the time go a little faster."
"2","Hearts topping and not even worth it. Food was surprisingly bad. I had pork and Mac grill cheese which didn't work on many levels. My son's chicken fingers were better than my dish."
"3","I've been here for brunch before and it was amazing! However, I was disappointed by a recent trip for a friend's bday. \n\nWe had a big group and hung out in the bar area, standing/mingling, and occupied the three tall, center tables. It was a Monday night and the service was EXTREMELY slow. It looked like the server, in addition to the bar area, was also responsible for some tables in the dining room.\n\nI ordered a drink and it arrived about 20 minutes later. A friend ordered food at the same time and his food arrived about 10 minutes before my drink. And we were sitting right next to the bar! The drink did not fit the description on the menu (it sounded like a martini, based on the description, but ended up being some sweet concoction served in a wine glass) and I sent it back (something I very rarely do). I asked for a different drink and it arrived, another 15 minutes later.\n\nThe dinner small plate and entree options leave much to be desired. With a large group, we wanted to order a few shareable plates, but all the small plates on the menu did not seem very sharing-friendly. Also, why does EVERYTHING have bacon?? The entrees seemed very over priced (tilapia for $22, are you kidding me?). \n\nI would definitely return for brunch, but never for dinner or drinks."
"2","I've lived in Madison for almost 8 years now and somehow had never made my way over to Bluephies, which I had heard was great for years. Last week I was finally in the area and suggested going to my friend who lives nearby. We went for dinner on a Tuesday night and I can't say I was impressed. \n\nWe were seated immediately in the center of their main dining room and told our server would be right with us. About 10 minutes went by and still no one had come over to our table, even to give us a couple of waters. Several other tables had been seated since we arrived and they had all received water and their other drink orders. Eventually we made eye contact with one of the servers who went straight to the other servers and pointed to us. After that our waitress came right over and apologized (apparently there was some confusion over who's section we were in). She was very friendly, but didn't offer to do much to make up for our 15 minute wait. \n\nI ordered a couple of their specialty vodka cocktails. They were fine, but nothing special. The zucchini appetizer with french onion dip was delicious and was the best part of the meal. For my entr\u00e9e I ordered the chile rellenos and was pretty disappointed. The menu described a pepper stuffed with rice, mushrooms and spinach. If there was anything besides rice in the pepper I couldn't see it or taste it. The black bean corn relish was mostly a heaping pile of black beans, next to a far too large helping of mole. The \""avocado salad\"" was a dollop of guacamole. Overall the dish wasn't bad in terms of taste, however it was entirely too small. Poblano peppers aren't too big but for 16 dollars I guess I expected more than one or for it to be battered and fried like I've had before. It was really just a small pepper with a bit of rice inside and a ton of black beans and mole. The topper of it all was our waitress decided to crack some joke about how hungry I must have been to have eaten so quickly. I had to bite my lip to avoid asking her how long it would take her to eat ten bites of food. \n\nOverall the food was slightly above average but WAY overpriced. I mean WAY overpriced. For 16 dollars I can get a much better and much larger meal downtown around the square. I've heard great things about their brunch so maybe dinner just isn't their forte. I'm glad I finally went, but I won't be back. Not for dinner anyway."
"1","Here I am, sitting at a table with my buddy at this location, writing this review because we are bored. It is 6p on Sunday, and this is the worst service that we've had in a long time! I only see two waitress in the whole place (one is the bartender), and we need refills. By the way, they don't have ground beef? \n\nIt's now been 1 hour since we ordered, and nothing. \n\nFinally got our food. Nothing special. Expected better! Took forever for our bill. We won't be coming back anytime soon."
"5","The costumer service is perfect and the waiters are very friendly, the food quality is really good compared with other places, but for me the best of Pascual's are the tortilla chips that they make, and the best is that they can also be found at the grocery stores in Madison. \nThe location is good, because you are so close to the downtown but you can park very close to the restaurant, and nice views to the street.\n\nActually the best restaurant in Madison!"
"5","So, funny I just read the previous review.  I am in the same boat, i.e. I have been known to drive from Chicago to Madison to see Nicole.  I have been unable to replace her... ;-(  Her cuts and colors are consistently good.  \n\nShe is great and was recently promoted to manager... kudos, she deserves it!"
"5","It's a fun place if you're looking to put together a pricey little care-package.\n\nLots of cool high-quality gift-ty things for the hard to shop for kid or adult.  \n\nI usually stop in for their supreme collection of chocolates, local (ahem, Gail Ambrosius) and international.  The chocolate and candy selection seems to be constantly changing, so I am constantly sampling.  Most recently I tried their new singly-wrapped spicy 50 cent carmels. oh la la. as sexy and spicy as they are sticky and sweet."
"2","I don't like this place too much. The energy felt a little weird. Maybe it is because I just had Palestinian Mediterranean last night. Maybe I was dining with my father in law and my step mother in law. Maybe the food is just, eh!\n\nI ordered the Lamb burgher. It was 1 lamb patty with a huge wedge of bread, almost doubly bigger than the patty. It was served with feta cheese, red onions and cucumbers on the side. The cucumber sauce tasted like more plain yogurt a little dill stirred in. Once I took off 2/3 of the bun, it was only okay.\n\nMy husband ordered the chicken doner kebab plate. There was no kebab. The plate consisted of  sliced up dry chicken with the same yogurt sauce and rice. More of... eh.\n\nThe server was nice but timid.\n\nI'm just didn't enjoy this place, whatever the reason was."
"2","Went for dinner with mother and uncle. All three meals where all right but not amazing. The quality to price ratio was off (too expensive). My meal was ordinary with meatballs that where dry and over cooked. Wine was good."
"4","I love the selection of baked goods and breakfast treats for work :)  I've never had lunch or eaten here...someday soon, will have to try it."
"1","Just go to St. Vinnie's on Willy Street. I've worked for this Goodwill, and they really don't do all that much good will compared with the awesome Vinnie's whose prices and selection are far better. I like my clothes sorted by size and not color too. Donate and shop at the far better option."
"3","This Copps is near my work.  What can you say, it's part of a huge grocery chain.  They have a decent selection of beer and wine at good prices...the reasons I stop here on my way home.  It can get really busy after work, especially on Fridays."
"4","Came here with my wife, after a long hard day of hot work outside....needing a cool beer and some grub.  It was early afternoon, quite a few folks there, we sat at the bar.\n\nVery pleased to see they offer Hopalicious on tap, decent selection of bottles.  We both ordered the Reuben, and were very pleased.  They used fresh shaved brisket for the meat, very generous helpings, and cook it right there, behind the bar.  Fries were typical pub fare but bonus - yummy brown horse radish mustard!\n\nAll in all, a very pleasant place for an afternoon bite and beer."
"1","Earlier today my friend & I ate here. She seemed to enjoy her meal. Mine tasted fine. \n\nUnfortunately I got in my car leaving Applebee's parking lot feeling extremely ill. I had to restrain from vomiting the entire ride home (this was my first meal of the day). I have been sick ever since I ate there.  Do not order the bruschetta salad. In fact, just do not go there. Period. Your stomach may thank you.  I called Applebee's to let them know, and the manager was very stoic and said an insurance company would contact me shortly. That's it. No apology. Nothing other than, 'what's your name and when did you come here?\""\n\nSo in summary, I would not recommend this place to my worst enemy."
"2","My husband had the new 5-cheese Mac and Cheese with chicken. Looked pretty good and he said it was tasty.\n\nI however had the tried-and-true baby back ribs. Awful! Very dry to the point the meat was very cooked down and the ends were all but burned. They didn't even try to cover it up with globs of bbq sauce, which is a common stunt. Very BLEH... Won't ever get the ribs there again and highly dis-recommend them from others. Ew."
"3","This place used to be better and more knowledgeable and helpful.  I guess I hit bad staff day or something.\ngood prices and a great selection.   \nNeed chairs to sit and read."
"1","Worst cheesy breadsticks! I've ordered this item from other locations and it was great but this location's version was terrible! They were over cooked, cut in half  and with 50% less bread sticks than other locations. Barely any cheese as well."
"3","First sandwich I had here...  a \""Pastrami Plus\"" on Asiago bread....  was one of the best sandwiches I've ever had.  OK..  maybe I'd been craving a pastrami sandwich for a week or two.  Every moment.....   In any case, that sandwich blew me away.  I couldn't believe it!   For $6 (maybe not even that!) I'd gotten a sandwich that lined right up with Bari in Chicago.  I called all my friends.  Asked my girlfriend if she'd consider moving up to Madison.  We could stay.  There was a good sandwich place.\n\nThen it all fell apart.  I went back the next day, and wished I'd gone to Cousin's.  Went back two more times over the next two weeks and for some reason they just couldn't duplicate that first one.  I don't know what to say.  I mean...  they weren't *bad*, just disappointing after that first one that was just *so* freaking good.  \n\nI also had their veggie lasagna once, on the recommendation of a friend (who raves about it btw).  Honestly, I wasn't impressed, but I'll admit that making lasagna is \""my thing\"" so I sort of resent when it's anything less than 5 stars.  Anyway, for the friendly people, the cheap prices, and that first sandwich...  3 stars to you, Gino's.  Occasionally I'll be back....  like a long-lost lover returning to the place he met an old love whom he never saw again."
"3","It was average. Not quite the same as italian delis in Chicago, but ok, I guess."
"4","We checked this place out because of positive reviews on Yelp.  This looks like a real find.   We did take out and it was all very good.   The food came out very quickly too and it was handed to me by the owner.  I knew this because of the news articles posted at the front restaurant that tells about how the restaurant came to Madison and its owners immigrated from China to America years ago etc.  It is an interesting story. \n\nWe will be going back for full service sometime soon and I expect my rating to go up as I think this is a hidden gem in a very unassuming location."
"1","My wife and I ate here after reading the high reviews and were REALLY disappointed. We visited on a rainy day and they had buckets all over the restaurant to catch water from the leaking roof, and the bathroom was even worse. I've seen cleaner dive bar bathrooms. Serious. Aside from the buckets and bathroom, the food was mediocre at BEST. The sauces tasted like they came out of a can and the egg drop soup was terrible! We won't be back."
"3","I had a crave for chinese food today and after reading good reviews about this location I went ahead and placed an order.\n\nI had the combination plate C26 (General Tso Chicken) since some yelpers raved about this dish and to be honest, I liked the sauce but I didn't like it had so much breading I could not even taste the chicken inside (if there was any). The accompaniments were a pork fried rice (that was tasty) and a pork egg roll (same as  most other chinese places) very chewy and a bland flavor. My hubby had the #66 (Kung Bo chicken) and he said there wasn't anything exciting about it. I really don't know if we will order again from this place."
"2","The specialized, high quality, service they provide at Brunsell is a valued addition to this community. That being said, however, their service is atrocious and their business could improve measurably with a few very simple improvements. \n\nFor instance, why not have a price list available for things like Knit bowls and knobs? Instead, they require you to go and ask the surly, rude, \""why are you bothering me\"" sales people at the customer service desk. At the very least, they should rename the desk.\n\nAs the owner of an old home in an historic neighborhood, I will continue to come back here, but I know they could probably make my life a lot easier Anselmi many more products than they are, if they took the time to bother to find out my needs. I will continue to buy salvage antique trims or stock from Home Depot and Menard's, just to avoid having to talk to these people again."
"4","Drive thru gets clogged quickly with caffeine addicts.\nThis being said the staff is on it like a rabbit in a hole.  They're fast, quick moving little bunnies aiming to please the heck out of those desperate caffeine addicts.\nThey keep the inside of this place clean if you ever get out of your car.\nIt's got the new updated look so it looks a bit too hip for Fitchburg.\nLast time I waited in line, they gave me a free coupon since it took so long.\nNo sweat Starbucky Bunnies, I'll be back."
"2","I did not enjoy my shopping experience at this Office Depot.  I had some specific shipping supplies that I was looking for, and the employees seemed extremely unenthusiastic to help me find them.  After wandering around for a long time unsuccessfully looking for my items, I put what I had found back on the shelf and drove to Staples, where I found the same items for half the price and much friendlier service to boot."
"5","Good, cheap, fast, friendly. Best fresh chips and salsa."
"1","Ugh. Where to begin.\n\nI drove up to Madison to visit my boyfriend on Cinco De Mayo, and decided we should get some mexican and margaritas to be festive! So we chose Laredo's.\nBad call.\nService was bad from the minute we walked in. Hostesses were unfriendly, and since they were on a 15 minute wait, they ripped off a piece of notebook paper, wrote the number \""30\"" on it, and told us they'd call our number.\n\nWe decided we'd grab some drinks at the bar while we waited. When the bartender finally made his way over to us, we ordered a beer and a margarita, to which he responded \""Uhh, that's gonna be 8 something... maybe.\"" So my boyfriend just handed him a $10 and told him to keep it. Really? Shouldn't he know how much to charge?\n\nWhen we finally got seated, we decided on nachos for an appetizer. They came out in one big pile of squishy mush. The meat was decent, but everything else tasted bland, and well.. mushy.\n\nWe ordered our entrees, and waited. And waited. And watched other people order and eat. And waited..... and waited... for 45 minutes, we waited. We actually considered just leaving (which I have never done and couldn't ever actually do). Finally our server came to our table and asked if we had gotten our food yet. We said no, he went to the kitchen, came back and told us they had boxed it up to go but that he would  bring it out now.\nYuck! I don't want food that's been sitting around in boxes for 45 minutes when I go out to eat. So my boyfriend told him we didn't want our food anymore and we'd just pay for the appetizer and leave.\n\nAt least we were too full of mushy nachos to really be hungry for the rest of our food.\n\nIn short, don't go to Laredo's."
"5","Mmmm mmmm good!  The catfish was our favorite, but everything was soooo good.  Get the cornbread!"
"2","Holy hole in a doughnut, Batman! \n\nThis dude seriously wanted 13+$ for a 10x10x48 box that you can get 20 of online for under 40 bucks (that was just the first price I found online while I was standing there). Thats over 5x profit.  Asked for owner to request  a more reasonable price. Owner was a dingy-butt about it. \n\nWhen my customer asks for a more reasonable price, they are giving me a chance to serve them. This guy made me feel like if I wanna box I needed to bring gloves. \n\n13 dollars!? Good grief."
"3","A Kohl's is a Kohl's is a Kohl's. I really don't have much to add here. I went to this store by chance has I needed to stock up on some warmer clothes. I was impressed with the sale that they had going on; on the same hand the selection was fairly limited.\n\nThe staff was very friendly and helpful and there was plenty of parking. I would not be opposed to going back."
"4","The Sheraton is a great place to stay in Madison.  The rooms have been renovated somewhat recently and are very nice and comfortable.  Customer Service has always been good to me - in my 20 or so stays at this location.  Workout room is good.  Restaurant is good.  There is a bar.  I'll be honest, there is nothing especially stunning or remarkable about this hotel, but I have never been disappointed with my stay.  I always have everything I need there.  You do need transport to downtown area (never a problem for me, as I am driving from Chicago).  My most recent stay was for a race - they are very accommodating to these special event situations.  Rooms on the SPG level are really nice the the SPG lounge has a great breakfast on weekdays!"
"2","Some staff were helpful. Some seemed uninterested, the shuttle bus drivers were very nice. The room was clean and the hall decor seemed updated and fine with me. The shuttle service to downtown Madison was a big plus since this hotel is not walkable to much. The rental bikes out front are fabulous when the kiosk is working.\n\nThe beds were very comfortable but when the temperature in the room went up a bit and got warmer we could smell urine. We were on the pet floor (without a pet) and so we assume that was what it was. We could never find a luggage cart....\n\nThere was a wedding Saturday night, we went and complained about the noise from the partying guests at midnight and it quieted down. We went and spoke to the guests ourselves at 1:30 again when they \""forgot.\"" We had a fire alarm go off from the drunken wedding guest at 2:45 a.m. There were elderly folks and parents with babies all over the front drive and the manager or staff never came outside and told us a thing. I finally went in to ask and he admitted it was the wedding folks and it was a false alarm. I know it's not their fault, but they could have handled that better. A \""sorry\"" at some point about the noise or  alarm would have been nice. Even nicer would have been if the manager had offered us a deal if we came to stay again or free breakfast since we literally got zero sleep Saturday night. \n\nThe wi-fi on the 4th floor was pretty darn mediocre even though the manager said it was fine. I couldn't download my e-mail to my phone!\n\nHere's the thing, I can get a Hampton Inn for about the same price. I get free breakfast, a clean room and no rowdy wedding folks there so I'm not sure that this was \""nicer.\"""
"3","The Sheraton Madison is a perfectly adequate business travel hotel. Yes, there are a few frayed elements to the hotels \""total package\"" - but the positive elements out-weigh the negative in a resounding way.\n\nA few things to consider - (1) It's a Sheraton. By that statement I mean - the Sheraton Madison is a mid-range, travel hotel. It is not a resort hotel or even a high-end business travel hotel. Guests should consider the class of hotel before they book a stay at the Sheraton (and especially when writing acerbic reviews). (2) The location is outside of the downtown core - but restaurants and amenities are easily accessible. In fact, the hotel has one of the most robust shuttle services to the downtown and the airport I have ever seen. Case in point, my co-worker landed a few hours before me (I rented a car). She called the hotel to request the shuttle. They told her the shuttle had already left the airport - but that she should get in a cab and tell the driver to charge the fare to the Sheraton. Wow. have you ever heard of such great customer service? (3) The hotel needs a little remodeling. The decor is clean and maintained, but there is definitely a need for a little more contemporary features. (4) The staff are super pleasant and very responsive to requests. I am a SPG Platinum member. I stay in SPG properties 75+ nights per year. The staff at the Sheraton Madison were some of the nicest staff I have encountered. \n\nAnd finally, (5) The Sheraton Madison is a mid-range business travel hotel. I know - I have already stated such; but it is super important to keep this in-kind if you are looking to book a more luxurious hotel for your staff in the Madison area. If, however, you are looking for a place to sleep while in town for meetings or business, and don't mind a short commute to the downtown area - the Sheraton Madison is a perfectly comfortable hotel."
"2","A small group of us made the short trek from the Polar Plunge to the Coliseum this past Saturday; had it not been for the close proximity to the plunge event, we probably would've gone elsewhere, and in hindsight, should have.\n\nThe place was a zoo, due to the Polar Plunge, so I wanted to cut them a little slack.  Even with the massive influx of people, I'm not so sure that I'd hurry back to the Coliseum Bar.  It appears to be quite dated and sorta' uninviting - clinical, almost.  Tap selection isn't anything to write home about, and the back bar area is limited to bottles/cans only (though they can mix drinks back there as well).  It was also a little pricey; 4 beers (2 taps (served in plastic cups), 2 bottles) were $18.\n\nThere was a \""DJ\"" blasting music the entire time, and neither he nor his sound system were very good... the sound was heavily distorted and lacking any fullness/bass.  Thankfully, we were standing in the back bar area, semi-shielded from the \""music.\""\n\nUltimately, we stayed for one beer, and then headed to the Wisco on Willy Street, where we enjoyed a great burger, a great selection of brews, and a better experience."
"3","Perkins is your standard chain diner.  Wide selection of continental cuisine, from all-day breakfast to steak.  This location is now 24 hour, and probably my favorite place for either drunk food or hangover food.  \n\nAtmosphere: your standard boring diner with vinyl booths and tables scattered into three areas with ugly curtains.   Early morning is usually trucker time, brunch and lunch are baby boomer and over.  Dinner is a mix of families and high schoolers.  Late night is more high schoolers, college kids and a mix of truckers.  \n\nService:  Sometimes good, sometimes bad, but either way you're left with a feeling that your server might go in the back and kill themselves instead of refilling your lemonade for a third time while you build towers with the syrups.  I've had excellent service, I've had terrible.  \n\nFood:  Breakfast, burger, sandwich and salad menu is the shining beacon of the menu.  Nothing special, your typical omelettes, tyson chicken sandwiches and overdressed salads, but I really love it anyway.  The dinner menu with fish, steaks and whatnot is a trainwreck, enter at your own risk.  Do yourself a favor and order the Mini-Chimis.  Dessert menu has gone down hill in recent years, maybe someday they'll get edible cookies, but the wildberry pie is to die for.  \n\nPrices:  About $8-10 per for entrees ($12ish for the dreaded dinner menu), desserts $3-6 per serving."
"1","Ok, let me start off and say Ive always been a Perkins fan, I used to go to the one off East Washington so I dont want to seem like a jerk, but what happened to this one? I had breakfast today and very little was good about it. I feel bad because of all the good memories, Its too bad this wasnt one of them.\n\nService - Fair to good. Our waitress was very busy but attentive and nice. Food came out hot and punctual.\n8/10\n\nFood Quality - Ok, heres where I might hurt feelings. I ordered the Steak and Eggs. The goods: Bacon was crunchy and hot, and the pancakes albeit much smaller then I remember tasted great. Lots of butter.\nThe bads: Everything else. The eggs were not scrambled, they were formed into a patty. The hashbrowns with cheese on top had a weird aftertaste (kind of bitter, soapy or something), and the steak, oh my god, was THE worst steak Ive ever attempted to eat. I am a steak fanatic so its my bad that I thought Perkins might suprise me (like Norms diner in LA, great t bone there). Nope, it was tough, tasted gamey, and soooo chewy. I spent so much time chewing everything else went cold. It was cooked to my liking its just they have horrible cuts of meat.\n2/10 (0/10 without bacon and pancakes)\n\nPrice - For what I got not good at all. I paid $12 for \""steak\"" and eggs and $3 for a side of bacon (4 strips). Coffee was priced well. I expect either a smaller steak of better quality then the 7oz piece of garbage I got.\n1/10\n\nExperience/Vibe - Typical of any Perkins, we weren't offered to have a booth which I think is a no brainer, some people prefer booths. A little cramped but not too bad.\n6/10\n\nOverall - 17/40\n\nMANAGEMENT PLEASE LISTEN!!!\nPlease your meat elsewhere. Ive never had such a tough piece of \""steak\"" in my life. I am anti A1 sauce cause I like the taste of steak as it is. I actually used A1 because of how nasty I felt trying to choke this down. I can't believe you call that steak, the only way I will ever buy that false steak again is if the world ran out of dog food and my dog was starving. Even then Id feel bad for my dog and probably end up giving him the hiemlich maneuver after choking on it.\n\n1 star, sorry Perkins, you might have just lost a customer to Dennys. Ill still patronize your bakery but as for meals I think I am done. Hire a meat manager or fire the one you have, please."
"4","I have been going to Parkway for years. I really like the Parkway omelette. The service is always fast and friendly. What are you waiting for ?"
"5","Great selection and wide variety with good prices make this my new favorite Asian/international market in Madison! Store and items were clean and fresh. Variety of ethnicities-- I went home with Jamaican, Mexican, Indian, Arab, Thai, and Chinese foods/products in my bags! Near downtown and very close to the beltline make it easy to access, even if you're coming from out of town. Seems like the strip mall and library which share a parking lot with Yue-Wah has all been recently updated. Looks nice."
"5","Hotel Review\n5 stars for clean, safe, hotel with free breakfast. This is a great location right off of downtown and the staff is super friendly. Check-in was quick. The rooms themselves are super clean and spacious. TV with cable + HBO. The other amenities include free WIFI (you get a code from the front desk when you check in), coffee, and pool. No problems with noise or difficulty sleeping. In the AM, free continental breakfast with hot waffles (delicious batter blueberry and regular), yogurt, boiled eggs, super 8 cinnamon rolls (amazing!), cereal, coffee, and milk. Saves you money on getting a complete breakfast. Free newspapers at the front desk as well\n\nPros- Very clean, bargain price, lots of amenities, top notch service, free breakfast\n\nCons- none\n\nHidden deals\n1. Free high speed WIFI\n2. Free breakfast\n3. Sign up at Super 8 website for wyndham rewards to earn free nights\n\nI am sold on Super 8, great hotel chain!"
"5","What a super nice Super 8!  We booked through Hotwire and chose a \""Secret Hotel\"" and I admit, I was a bit bummed to see that we were given a Super 8.  However, I shouldn't have been, at all.  This place was really quite nice and the manager, Josh, went above and beyond to make sure we had a room with a fridge.  Everything was very good here for a two-star motel.  Rooms were comfy, clean and well equipped.  The pool was very nice and clean.  Breakfast was your typical, but tasty, continental fare.  Every employee we encountered was pleasant. \n\nThere is a lot of annoying construction going on around this place right now.  Which didn't really cause any huge issues, just a few minor traffic annoyances.  This is a perfectly fine location if you plan to get around Madison by car.  It is close to everything one would go to Madison for.   \n\nAgain, I was disappointed to see Super 8 pop up in my \""Secret Hotel\"" reveal, but now, I'm glad it worked out that way.  Great place at a great price."
"3","This is a nice little grocer.  I wish their cash register would work better so that you don't have to wait 10 minutes to ring up.  But otherwise its nice."
"3","The upside? This place is huge.\n\nThe downside? This place is huge.\n\nI would say the experience is determined by how the vendors use the space and how they try to make the guests feel.  Both times I've been here (Food & Wine and Well Expo) it was hard to relax and feel casual.  Cement floors, no music, and fluorescent lighting definitely makes you feel too convention-y.  That being said, they can fit a ton of people and vendors, so that's great.  \n\nHowever, if someone has a band playing, maybe some table cloths with color, and some different lighting, this might be nice!\n\nParking was $6 for me, even when my husband was only dropping me off.  :/\nAND cash only.  Srsly."
"1","They announced today they are closing. As you can see due to my previous review I am not surprised. Sad but not suprised."
"5","I was recommended to go to Wright's by a friend of mine and I wanted to take the time to post a glowing review because the service was beyond my expectations. Tom and the rest of his staff are not only highly qualified, they are friendly, honest and very accommodating. If you are looking for a great mechanic, look no further!"
"2","Whenever we go there, we are hit with a bill of nearly $200 or more. They charge excessivley for small things like looking at some sample under a microscope for 5 mins or $20 for shampoo. We are seriously considering switching."
"1","I would not recommend this vet clinic. We had used this clinic for years but over the last 4 years the service has gone down hill. The staff and Dr Hook are unprofessional and rude. If we ever called to ask about something that concerned us they would blow us of or make us feel stupid for calling. When we took the pet in they talked down to us and didn't answer the question asked, They showed no compassion for our pet and made us (loyal customers) feel like a number."
"1","They charge too much, care is so-so.  I would go to Veterinary Emergency Service.  I wish I could do it all over again.  They will also suggest you take the route that is \""most expensive,\"" and prey on your feelings towards our pet.  Stay away."
"1","Checked into our room and went with kids to the pool. The hot tub had black water in it. No kidding. You couldn't see the bottom of the tub. The water smelled disgusting like smelly feet. How can staff not know what is going on in their hotel!  We won't be back."
"2","3 dart machines, a Foosball, a shuffleboard. Wouldn't call this a place for games. Upstairs opens at 11? What's up there that's not open at 9? But as a bonus, drinks are cheap, staff is friendly. Great job."
"2","\""Meh. I've experienced better.\"" sums it up just right. Forgive me for being an economics major, but I firmly believe that prices should reflect the cost of production. If I need to print a black and white two page document, it should cost 20 or so cents, no matter what the CONTENT of the two pages are. I should not have to pay 10 times this amount just because *what* I need to print is a packaging slip. I raised a question about this while I was in the store, but the guy gave me a condescending speech about how they are a for-profit business, so I just paid quickly to get out of there. $2 is no skin off my nose, but it's the principle of the matter!"
"4","It's tiny and dingy, but they sell everything you'd need to make a Thai curry. Or whatever Asian dish you're trying to make. Their produce is also a lot cheaper than other grocery stores in the area. The only downside is their tiny parking lot with the 30 min. parking."
"3","Why am I surprised that The Rustic hasn't been reviewed yet? A solid three stars, smack dab in the middle. It's a dive bar on Park St., in a part of town that most of my friends tend to avoid. I casually mentioned one day that I had gone to The Rustic the night before, and was met with wide eyes and admonishment. What? It's harmless. They've got PBR tall boys (or silos, if you will.) They have a long, wooden bar, wobbly pub tables and stools, and bags of Cheetos if you get hungry. We were there for an \""after-party\"" of sorts, where my friend's drunken roommate was somehow doing a \""working interview\"" bartending. Hilarity!"
"1","Somebody dared me to check out this place in Madison on the topic of worse scummy bars in Wisconsin and this ranks among the top. My shoes became very sticky the moment walk gin this place and it took a while to get that stuff off my shoe. The smell of the place was atrocious and the place was disgusting everywhere and among the drunk quacks who hang out here. No college students in this bar this is a place for the seedier elements of Madison and it oth showed and smelled the night I visited here recently. A very scary bar"
"5","This place is a must-go!  We went there this weekend for the first time and the service was excellent.  Not only that, but the doughnuts were exceptional.  It has been hard for me to find a good-family owned bakery since I moved to Madison, but here it has been all along!  We will definitely be back soon.  My favorites were the sprinkle ones and the apple fritter looked amazing.  The girl working said they don't make long-johns all the time, mainly for special orders, but I bet those would be great!  I may just have to special order some!! Check it out!  But...get there early!!  Before 7 on a Sunday!"
"2","Drove all the way downtown so my girlfriends daughter could get a few donuts. Not too impressive. They have a lot of donuts, but they only have a few different types/flavors.  I have seen larger selections at most grocery stores. That being said, I walked away paying only 4 bucks for our breafast. Not too bad."
"4","Super cute, old school Italian-American restaurant, replete with Christmas lights strung around the bar, very friendly wait staff and a killer beer/drink list. I didn't have pizza, but it looked good...Had the special veggie lasagna and a couple vodka drinks (they have Death's Door, among others) and the excellent garlic bread. The vibe is laid back- really homey. I could see making this a regular stop in the neighborhood. Others obviously agree because the place was packed on Saturday night."
"4","If they hadn't changed their location, it was a sure-shot 5 stars! The old location inside University Square mall was just awesome. The food was unbelievably tasty and cheap! The food's still good, but the price is slightly higher now, given the nicer location. I'd give it a try if I'm in the vicinity."
"2","The bar was okay (satisfactory drink menu), but the dining room made me feel like I was in a coffin.  I had a pizza and a salad, both of which did the job in satiating my hunger, but neither of which I'd write home about.  In fact, I don't think I'd take my parents here, and they love mediocre dining.  I won't be back."
"4","I love this place.  I've been going to Paisan's since i was about 10 years old.  The best is a Porta Salad and then going on to the Bella Pizza with onion's!  BEST PIZZA I've ever had!"
"2","What a complete disappointment.\n\nWe live nearby, and yesterday had some big and exciting news to celebrate. It was late and nice outside so we decided to talk a walk to Paisan's and try it for the first time.\n\nWhat do you do when you need to celebrate? You order champagne. We ordered 25 dollar champagne. We got ... a BOTTLE OF COOK'S. Really?? REALLY? If you are going to serve us cheap champagne, fine, but at LEAST be smart enough to get something no one will recognize! What's more, while the waiter was nice and all, he wasted tons of our champagne. He didn't pour it right so it fizzed all kinds and he kept spilling it. THANKS. That was our 25 dollar bottle of effin' Cook's you just wasted.\n\nWe tried to move on, and order an appetizer. It's pretty much bread and cheese, or bread and cheese. Or bread and garlic. Cool. It was fine, but nothing special.\n\nThe pizzas were also fine, but nothing special. I got vegetarian pesto, Derek got the spicy one. I think these people are relying WAYYYY too much on their name, their legacy, and crappy Kraft cheese.  Way too much cheese. Really good cheese can be used in just the right amount for perfect flavor -- if you add a ton of bland, poor quality cheese to something, that's not going to make it suddenly taste better!!!\n\nDesserts? Meh. Derek was horrified to find the tiramisu cut like a pie slice and not a square. (he's picky)\n\nIt was a pretty building. The acoustics in the back room, the one overlooking the \""lake\"" (read: freeway) are terrible though. Also, it's dirty. The floors were covered.\n\nI'm thinking ... never again. Not worth my close-to-90 dollars. And it ruined our celebration. I really wish we had gone somewhere else."
"3","Was here for a work dinner event.  Service was not good.  Very slow too.  Worst service I've gotten here.  Usually gotten better service."
"2","I'm sad to give Paisan's a \""Meh\"", because it's a Madison staple (especially in my family), but I'm just not that fired up about it. I've had both lunch and dinner here, and while the food is never bad, per se, it's also not outstanding - and for the price of some items, it should earn at least a \""really good\"". Mozzarella bread, for example, is fine, but would be easy (and way cheaper) to make at home - it's just two big pieces of bread with some cheese sprinkled on it and put in the oven. The only thing about my most recent meal at Paisan's that stood out to me was the seasoning on the crust of my taco pizza. And the fact that my menu pages were water-damaged and falling apart, and that the booth area we were sitting in felt a lot like a Catholic church confessional. :/\n\nOverall: Not a bad place, I guess, but pretty solidly \""meh.\"""
"1","Service was extremely slow and not very useful...never once asked if we wanted something to drink, just brought water out. Took a hour for a 9\"" pizza that didn't even have all the correct toppings on it. Food was \""meh\""."
"2","Not impressed, especially given the reputation that it's a great place. It started with not being able to sit in the main room and we got taken down a long hall in a secluded room full of booths, with a loud fan and a dark, lonesome, secluded setting. The space between the table and bench is quite large so makes it awkward being so far from your food. The spicy cheese bread was about the only thing that gets a 3/4 star. Otherwise, the food was just crummy- Mozzerella sticks, Cesar salad (served with ginormous portions of dressing), pizza was bland with dry and hard crust and littler cheese and the Monday pasta special was just pasta, nothing special and could be made at home much better. Several of the pasta dishes came with very little sauce and the server came sparingly to check on us, and didn't even make it to run the check and we paid up front. The only thing that made this experience is being with family, and that was the point of going out for dinner!"
"5","If I can't give the Key a 5 star rating, I don't know what I would. As a disclaimer, I worked there for 2 years and left on unsavory terms with the owner. The fact that she (wears the pants) and her husband are doing back-to-back prison sentences bumps it from a 4 to a 5.\n\nNow, any bar in madison on friday or saturday is bound to be butts-to-nuts busy, so don't take away stars for it being packed, that's just dumb.\n\nDrinks=strong. \n\nI'd be hardpressed to tell you the prices, but I'm guessing they're average. Stick to specials and you'll do all right. In response to another reviewer... most male bartenders come off as tools, it's in the job description, and the Key's aren't on the same level as those at Brothers, Mad Ave or even (maybe even especially) the Nitty.\n\nFood=Exceptionally good bar food+a ton of it+cheap.\nA burger special is $5 and it's uncomfortable to finish all of it. I recommend trying.\n\nIf you're ambling towards Camp Randall or the Kohl Center, stop in for a quick round or two of shots. It's easy enough to get to the bar in a timely manner and it's right on the way for a lot of you."
"5","I have been here a few times now, and it's been nothing been great. \n\nWe always order the appetizer platter - shrimp toast is to die for. I also ordered the hot and sour soup tonight, which was delicious! The bits of tofu and bamboo shoots are my favorite. \n\nI wasn't overly hungry this visit and more so just tagged along for company. I did pick off others plates however :), and the sesame chicken is tasty. It was ordered hot on the spice level, and hot it was! Everything was nice and fresh, and portions are filling with a little left over to take home. \n\nThe service is always beyond exceptional! Staff is super friendly, funny, and accommodating. Our waitress tonight was super cute and funny. It took a little bit to get water and soda refills, but since the food was so good we weren't too concerned. \n\nWill keep returning :) very nicely run and sweet staff with fresh delicious food!"
"3","There is nothing particularly stunning or revolting about Jade Garden: it is what it is.  I ordered from here all the time in college - cheap food, specials every so often if you Google it, pretty quick turnaround as well.\n\nI was back in Madison for New Year's, and I ordered from here on New Year's Day, online.  Not only were they open (unlike some of their delivery friends), but they had it at my door in about 15 minutes.  I don't know if I'm scared or impressed, but I'm going to go with impressed.\n\nFood is traditional blah pan-Asian cuisine, but I did enjoy the fried potstickers, fried wontons, and eggrolls.  Then again, anything fried is soooo gooooood.  Chicken with broccoli was decent - broccoli wasn't soggy, and it was aplenty.\n\nBetter Chinese food than most places in Madison, with great delivery times to boot.  Someday, Jade Garden, I will be back."
"1","Got delivery... Looked em up on here and wasn't too impressed (3 isn't horrible) but really looking forward to trying the rangoon .  Phone etiquette was nice, delivery was fast, food was eh.  I wasn't expecting a lot, I just needed a greasy Chinese fix, which I got!!  The generals chicken was dried out and bland... the egg rolls were soggy but the rangoons?  Those were the WORST thing I may have ever eaten!!  I was crushed.   I thought for sure I was safe with those... but no, I did not get to enjoy the deliciousness of a previous reviewer.  Mine were stale, with lumpy chunks of nasty cream cheese and maybe one slice of green onion per rangoon.  No Crab.  Not a thing.  It was bad enough to do such a crappy job, but then to just leave out the one possible saving grace?  Horrible.  Such a disappointment :("
"3","Me give this place 4 years of me life and $50,000 and all me get is piece of paper that say \""Numen Lumen\"" at top. It supposed to be proof of wealth of knowledge that me absorb but guess what? Everybody else on planet take one look and know me no learn jack. They all like, \""Liberal arts degree? Thank you, but that position has already been filled,\"" or \""Isn't a poli sci major just a philosophy major who doesn't live in his parents basement?\"" Not me fault! Advisor tell me that it really not matter which major me choose! Engineering students they all get six figures and Ferrari 599's and seven girlfriends even though they nerds. But no one else want to go to Engineering Building because they hear rumor it house of sin. So I spend all me time in upside-down Humanities building wondering why it upside-down, and trying to find hidden eleven in Big Ten logo, and now me poor.\n\nBy the way, when I went there the biggest celebrity in town was Scanner Bob. Is he still around?"
"4","A nice list of loose leaf teas, which are served in a light-bulb looking glass ware. This Jiffy Lube converted place is an unexpectedly pleasant coffee shop on the S Park street. Very friendly staff, a fantastic view of Copps, and overall a charming neighborhood cafe."
"2","I'm reviewing this place since it's the best Indian restaurant in Madison, but my review applies to all the other ones in the city:\n\nIf you crave real Indian food, I would highly recommend you stay away from this place. The food in their buffet is very watered down to cater to American tastes since there's practically no spiciness or flavor to anything in their buffet. Heck, even the watered down Indian food places in San Francisco are more spicy (and better) than this place. \n\nHowever, like any other Indian restaurant in Madison, this place has cheap/reasonably priced buffet lunch specials which makes it worth a visit if you happen to be starving and in the area, but if you have any real expectations about Indian food in the region, you're better off trying your luck in Milwaukee or Chicago instead."
"3","The place is quite nice in appearance and seemed very clean.  The food was hot and the buffet was kept stocked nicely.  The food wasn't bad but wasn't that good either.\n\nWhen I think of Indian food, I want a depth of flavor, some intensity.  The food here was none of that.  It was even somewhat bland.  The chicken masala had nice chunks of white breast meat, but there was hardly any spice in it.  Seemed like Midwestern chicken gravy.  And the beef curry was just as flavorless.\n\nThe nana bread was good as was the rice Brian's.  but that was about it."
"1","I really like the triple order of cheese sticks at Toppers.  Their pizza really sucks, but the cheese sticks are pretty awesome.  I'm not exactly the most adventurous eater all the time, but i decided to try the mac and cheese pizza.  \n\nObviously they were copying Ian's in that department, but I figured since I like the Ian's pizza, i would try Toppers.\n\nBig mistake.\n\nOMFG, the first bite was awful.  I knew there was something off right away.  I lifted up the noodle cheese crust thing, and I realized that the whole crust was covered in some sort of orange glue.  Seriously, the pizza was covered in some imitation cheese-wiz.  I say imitation because cheese-wiz is better that the orange shit that was on my pizza.  And I ordered a large!  I actually threw the rest of the pizza away, because I wouldn't feed that shit to a dog."
"3","It's a decent place but the food is hit or miss. I've had some great food as well as some really lousy stuff....once my wife sent her stuff back coz it seemed like it was a week old!\nOk to try sometime if u r in the neighborhood, but I wouldn't travel much for it."
"2","I was a regular at Nam's till they started decreasing their portion size for the same price.  K23 which was the beef pepper steak with rice is my favorite!!!  But this place does not appreciate customer loyalty, so please don't bother going there."
"2","Don't really know what they really mean by Nam but it's definitely not a Vietnamese restaurant. The name is quite misleading.\n\nThe pho is below average but i guess ppl just simple dont have an option in Madison though. If you want to have decent pho/vietnamese foods, you have to go all the way to the west side for saigon noodles. Madison sucks"
"3","I've only ever ordered delivery from Nam's, so I don't know how it is in person. Their food is impressive enough to make them a regular in my delivery rotation, but pricey enough that I probably won't go for them more than once a month or so. Their lemongrass chicken wings were the dish that originally sold me on the place, with their surprising and delicious flavor combination, but all the typical americanized Chinese dishes I'd get anywhere else have been at least as good if not better than other places I've tried around Madison. I get bubble tea with every order--delicious and refreshing. My favorite so far is the honeydew milk tea, but I haven't tried them all yet. I tried one of their Vietnamese sandwiches recently, and it was too spicy for my taste, but from what I could taste after picking off all the peppers and still feeling like I was martyring my mouth, it seemed like the meat had a nice texture and the sauce was good...maybe just not my thing. \n\nPersonally, my go-to takeout places are usually those that give huge portions, so I can justify the price by the fact that they give me yummy leftovers for a week...Nam's isn't like this, and it makes me sad. But it's still good enough to keep going back to, just not quite as frequently."
"1","I really want to like this place, but I've had a bad experience every time I've ordered from them. A few weeks ago, I ordered delivery from Nam's and my food took almost an hour longer than the estimated arrival time. When I finally received my food, there was a curly black hair sitting directly on top of my curry. Luckily, I still had my crab rangoons and I was able to eat those, but I certainly had no appetite for the curry... I called Nam's as soon as I found the hair and was told by the employee that answered the phone that he would \""leave a note\"" about getting me a free entree next time I ordered from them. Well, I just ordered food from them again and received a very rude phone call from one of the workers demanding to know why I was receiving a free entree. Let's just say that I am a little insulted that, after I gave them a second chance, they would call me and accuse me of lying to get free food. \n\nSide Note: After being reassured that my food would be here in 45 minutes, it has now been an hour and I am officially never ordering from here again."
"4","Always a consitent, great meal.  The service is excellent - we've always had really friendly staff.  I LOVE the beat salad and the mushroom pasta special (served only at lunch)."
"2","A friend recommended this place while I was visiting Madison. I was hesitant because it's a chain but she highly recommended. I regret not just yelping for an Italian restaurant in Madison. The food wasn't that great and the service was OK. I'm tired of Italian restaurants throwing noodles and sauce together and calling it an Italian dish. Lessoned learned....I'll stick to yelping restaurants."
"2","A couple of my friends really enjoy this place, but no matter how much I try, I just can't warm-up to the place.\n\nThey do have a decent tap selection, which includes a nice mix of local micros and tasty macros.  Not in the mood for a tap?  Check out the large selection of bottled brews.  Their beer menu is excellent because it lists the style, the origin (city/state/country), and ABV.  Pricing is a bit higher than you'll find at most of the locally-run pubs.\n\nThe food and service is where I have to take away a star or two... The food I've tried has been greasy - from the chicken tenders to the pizza rolls to the regular pizza - it's all been terribly greasy.  It tastes hyper-processed - I think another reviewer made note of this, and I couldn't agree more... And, it's overpriced - count on spending around $22-$24 for dinner, a drink, and a soda/tea.  \n\nService is (wait for it) spotty.  I've been to this location five or six times, and have only once had a really good server - we sat in the bar, and our server was excellent.  He never let a glass go beyond 2/3 empty.  Sitting in the dining area has resulted in less than favorable service, even when the place wasn't busy.\n\nSo... Old Chicago... I'm sorry, but I have to give you a \""MEH\"" rating.\n\nFood = 2 stars (greasy; seems sub-par)\nService = 2 stars (very spotty; sit in the bar for best service)\nValue = 2 stars (pricey)\nMISC = 3 stars (good beer selection)\n\nWith places like Roman Candle, Rosatti's, Glass Nickel, Buck's, and others very nearby, I can't justify hitting Old Chicago.  Sorry."
"5","I took my dog to another vet for 2 years when I first moved here. The experience was always fine. Nothing bad at all, but nothing to be too excited about. \nI didn't really ask around, but I started hearing more and more about A Breed Apart. A few of my coworkers who are surgeons had dogs with serious problems requiring surgery. The surgeries were performed at A Breed Apart, and they couldn't be happier. They also noted how reasonable the pricing was for their dog's care. They didn't feel like they were getting fleeced at all.\nSo when it was time for Jackson's annual checkup, we established care at A Breed Apart. They took fantastic care of his and answered all of my detailed laundry list of questions without hesitation. I was very happy with the switch, especially because I feel happy establishing care with vets that I would feel comfortable taking my dog in the case of an emergency."
"1","I do love Target, but after this experience I will no longer shop at the specific Target. Last week I ran into Target to purchase two C.D's one for myself and one a gift. One of them was regular price and one was on sale for only $9.99. I thought great, what a deal! I go up the check-out, which is busy, and wait a few minutes to find that my C.D. did not come up as the sale price posted. The check-out girl gets a manager to come over and he does a price check. I tell him there are two versions of the C.D. a deluxe and regular, I had chosen the regular. He asks if I got in on the end of a isle on in the middle. I tell him in the middle under pop/rock. He tells me the C.D. is $13.99 on a big display at the end of an Isle and says nothing more. It's been about 4-5 minutes now and there are people waiting behind me. So I say \""Ok, Never mind, I do not want it then.\"" The girl just stares and me and the manager just stands there? I have no idea what is going on, so I say again, \""Never mind, I don't wait it\"" and swipe my card. Again, a silence and they are both just standing there. I say \"" I swiped my card\"" to the check out lady and she \""ugh's\"" at me and give me my receipt without my bag with my other C.D. in it. I had to literally reach over the counter to get it. I decided to run back to the C.D. section to re-read the SALE sign I saw. Ha, well it was gone. They had taken in down, so I talk to someone in the Electronic department and they have no Idea what is going. The manager comes back and explains that yes, the sign was left up past the sale date and I did not wait long enough for him to find out...I told him that he had me standing there in silence for almost 10 minutes talking on his \""walkie talkie\"" and maybe a \""one minute ma'am\"" or \""Im just looking into that for you miss\"" would have been a nice indication that he wasn't just standing there staring off into space. He proceeded to argue with me telling me that I just walked away from him. Why didn't he say \""Wait one minute Ma'am\"" or something, anything for that matter...? Too bad I didn't catch his name, or else that would be on here too. I shut him up by saying \""Don't worry about it, I will be returning the one C.D. I bought and buying both at Best Buy, I'm sure they will appreciate my business!\"" I got my C.D. at Best Buy for ONLY $6.99 :) See if you can beat that Target!"
"2","Noodles & Company...universally loved, almost.  I say almost because there seems to be an attitude among foodies that this chain sucks.  I, personally, don't think it sucks, but it could be a lot better.\n\nThe main problem with this location is the size of the restaurant itself.  It would probably get three stars from me if not for this problem. There is simply not enough seating to accommodate the amount of people who want to eat here on weekends.  I'm not a fan of waiting for tables unless the restaurant is REALLY good, so I've just walked out a few times before placing my order.  When I do stick around, usually I feel really crowded due to the close proximity of the tables.\n\nThere are also lots of little kids, who may or may not leave you teetering precariously on the brink of utter madness.  It's probably better to go during the work-week.\n\nThe food is reasonably tasty and quickly served, but inconsistent.  The noodles are always cooked perfectly but sometimes the sauces come out too watery.  The ability to add meat (or tofu) to any dish is helpful, since some of the dishes are pretty bland otherwise.  My favorite recently has been the penne rosa, which has just the right amount of kick.  However, for a place devoted to pastas, and considering the rather high prices, I expect to be more impressed.\n\nYou probably already know if you like Noodles & Company or not. If you aren't familiar with this chain and are thinking of trying it out, I would not recommend this location; there are quite a few others in the Madison area which are less crowded.  For a quick bite, Noodles is pretty good, but you can do better."
"1","I want to start by saying I LOVE LOVE LOVE Olive Garden.  It's truly one of my all-time favorites and usually my go-to Italian place when I want something yummy and not want to worry about quality.\n\nThat's why I was SOOOOOO disheartened by this particular location.  The waitress was awesome!!  Best part of the night.  BUT, the food was crap.  Seriously, I almost sent my meal back because it was so freaking bad.  I got the fetuccini alfredo.  The pasta was severely over cooked.  They noodles fell apart as I was trying to wind them around the fork to eat them.  And the sauce was poorly seasoned (like no flavor whatsoever) as well as chunky.  Have you ever had chunky alfredo sauce?  I was thinking, what the heck did they use in this, cottage cheese??  Ewwww!  That's all I have to say about that.  My dining partner said his noodles were also mushy (I thought, maybe, it was just the fetuccini, but nope).\n\nSave your money and eat somewhere else or go to a different Madison location because THIS one was so totally not worth it."
"5","This is our favorite take out place.  The food is always fresh, flavorful and plentiful.  The owners are very nice also.  We drive out of the way for take out from them."
"2","Don't stay here if you need to get sleep. They rent rooms to groups of teenagers on outings... so there are rooms full of kids with no supervision (and no manners) running up and down the halls yelling all night. I thought it was illegal for minors to rent a room without an adult... apparently not at this place.\n\nI came here for EPIC training, and this was on the list of approved hotels. I'm going to suggest that EPIC change that. I got almost no sleep and I have to wake up at 6am, sit in class, and get on a plane... with no sleep. \n\nLet your employer pay a little more and stay at a better hotel."
"4","Not the best hotel in the world, but the previous reviewer hasn't been there lately.  They've earned their 3 stars (of 5).  Comfy beds, lots of space, not much service (except if you call the front desk).  My main complaint is that 1/4 of the times I've been there (4 weeks, weekdays only) over the course of a work project) the other clientele has been a little...  I dunno...  loud and drunk.  Not always, but sometimes.  After all, though, check hotwire, they're always on there with the *deals*"
"2","The only thing irish about this \""irish pub\"" is they sever Guiness and have Jameson Whiskey. Otherwise there isn't anything irish on the menu and no irish ambiance at all. Boooring."
"1","I wouldn't go here again, although the staff was seemingly \""nice\"" I don't know if they know what they are doing in the back. \nWent in to get my headlight bulbs replaced, they forgot to replace two screws that hold the entire headlight assembly in place ( luckily I noticed right after it was done), and now my headlights are all askew, so they either forgot to adjust them or didn't know how. I'd do it myself if I could, but then again, I don't work at a car service center."
"5","After taking my photos to countless places looking to get them framed, I visited u-frame-it after receiving a coupon and I'm so glad I did. They had the best selection of frames in the city, and their prices were far better than any of the competition. To top it all off, the lady we spoke to could not have been friendlier or more helpful. 5 stars all around."
"2","Not offensively bad, but there are too many good restaurants in Madison to waste your time on a mediocre at best chain like Chili's. Better restaurants on the West Side. Heck, better restaurants at the same mall: If you're considering Chili's, go to Granite City instead.\n\nIt's also unforgivable (well, almost...I'll expand on this when I review the Dane) to be a bar and grill with lousy fries."
"1","Went there today and the waitress was beyond rude. Another waitress came over and gave us chips and salsa. Our group thought chips and salsa came with the meal, so we started eating then. Our waitress then asked who was going to pay for the chips they gave to us.... We refused to pay that was not our mistake.\n\nThe waitress then asked us 3 different times how we are going to pay for 8 of us. We asked every time to please separate the bills. She not only rolled her eyes, but she said \""okay then...\"" in a rude tone. I would not go back to this particular location. \n\nWe also had to asked 3 times for waters and the drinks that we ordered. Finally the manger came over to help.  The only thing that evened out the trip was the fact the food was actually good...."
"5","I don't get items dry cleaned very often, so when I needed to have a formal dress cleaned, I wasn't sure where to go.  Even though I had coupons in my Bucky Book for three other cleaners, I decided to use Right Touch after reading the Yelp reviews (those other cleaners scored very low, and Right Touch scored very high).  \n\nMy dress had only been worn once, and it had a large dark stain on the front.  The dress was stored in my closet with that stain for over seven years!  I was not sure it could be cleaned at all.  But Right Touch said they would do their best, and they got it completely out!  The dress looks brand new, and I am thrilled!  Plus, the price was incredibly reasonable!  I will definitely use them again for any future dry cleaning needs!!"
"1","This place was recommended by our regular auto guy as a place to have our AC looked at. The mechanic (or owner?) was not very friendly throughout interaction. We ended up paying $100 to have the problem diagnosed, which was more than we expected. We were told the air compressor was out, and it would cost $900 to replace. We decided not to have it fixed, and it felt like there was some amount frustration directed towards my husband about that choice.  \n\nHere's the reason for the one-star review: My husband gets home, starts googling to see if he can do this work himself. He finds out, that on our model of car -- which is a very common model -- there is one electrical relay that always goes out first on the AC. My husband bought it for $60 on ebay and fixed it himself. AC fixed. \n\nI just quite frustrated to consider that we would have put $1,000 into repairs, and it wouldn't have fixed the problem."
"2","Good docs - young but nice and responsive to questions.  The office staff isn't the most pleasant.  \nThe prices are reasonable and the facility is new - very nice."
"1","Stopped in to get help replacing a pendant and sconce that we had bought years ago.  The lady who helped me was not very helpful and seemed bothered to even give me minimum information.  I had a bad experience a year or so ago with customer service here but hoped they might have improved in this area...nope!"
"3","Went to the house part for restaurant week. The setting is unique. The food is about average, but perhaps it is a little overpriced for the portions received. Not bad, but I probably won't come back until my folks are in from out of town. I also want to try the grill part that is the barn. Maybe that's more my style."
"1","This is one of the worst restaurants I've ever tried to order from.  They take 2 hours to get you delivery, they always screw up the my order and they have no clue how to give good service.  Every time I've worked with them, they've screwed something up and they've never tried to make it right.  If Madison had any other food options, I would never order from them again."
"2","Monkeyshines is the way to end a night of bad decisions."
"2","I was not thrilled with this gym.  At the Fitchburg location, there is plenty of equipment, and the little TVs are a treat.  It is clean.  My biggest complaint is the trainers, who spent more time chatting with me than helping me develop a routine I'd actually do.  At first I was really excited about the group classes, but then I realized the instructors don't make corrections, which is not only disappointing, but can be dangerous.  I'd recommend taking full advantage of the 14 day trial period, as the fees end up being quite costly if you aren't going to use the gym."
"2","Tired and outdated equipment.  It's embarrassing to jog on a treadmill to have it squeak and rattle so loud everyone looks at you.  While I was never the slimmest person there, I wasn't the heaviest either.  After 5 years, I finally left because membership was being offered to new members for considerably less than I was paying."
"2","As far as fast food is concerned, Taco Bell isn't all that bad.  I usually get two of the chicken soft taco frescos - they're lower in calories, and not terribly bad for the 'ole diet.\n\nHowever... this location irks me for a number of reasons.  Allow me to recreate a few visits (all from the drive thru).  I only know the dates because I looked them up via online banking.\n\nVisit on 9/14/12:\nTB: \""What's up?\""\nMe: \""Excuse me?\""\nTB: \""Aw yeah - whatchya' need?\""\nMe: \""I'd like two chicken soft taco frescos?\""\nTB: \""Cool.  Cool.  What else?\""\n\nVisit on 10/2/12:\nTB: \""Hey, how's it going?\""\nMe: \""Fine, thanks.\""\nTB: \""What's new?\""\nMe: \""Um, can I place an order?\""\nTB: \""Sure you can.\""\n\nVisit on 10/10/12:\nTB: \""What's up?\""\nMe: \""Can I place an order?\""\nTB: \""You bet.\""\n\nNever once have they greeted me with a, \""Welcome to Taco Bell, may I take your order?\""\n\nI'm not sure why they're trying to be so hip/laid back/cool - it's a Taco Bell ferchristsakes.  I'm not buying a Billabong shirt or a surfboard - I'm ordering a dollar-something taco from a drive thru at 7:00pm on a Tuesday.  \n\nKnock off the casual crap and just process our orders, 'ya dig?"
"5","This is one of my FAVORITE west side eats!  I HIGHLY recommend the veggie spring rolls and the number 60 & the number 65 (I think this is it, it is lemongrass chicken with eggroll).  I can't order anything else because I love these!!!"
"2","Food is good, service is terrible, the staff didn't come to our table for over 10 min finally when they arrived they wanted our whole order.  Didn't ask if we wanted drinks at all. We were then never spoken to during our meal except to see if they could take our sauces away.  Dirty dishes were left on our table thru the meal. Staff was more interested in filling sauces, and condiments then giving service to the customers.  You can the best Food but if service is bad you will continue to lose customer like us who used to come frequently."
"3","I wish there was a half star so I could put this at 3.5. I like Saigon Noodles the food is fresh and the place is clean. There are several good choices on the menu that ensures you can eat here a couple of times a month and not have the same thing twice. A few more choices on the menu and I'd throw in that extra half a star."
"5","This is one of my favorite places in town, and it's been great to watch this business grow over the years. I absolutely love vermicelli noodle dishes. I've eaten here several times, but always order the exact, same thing: vermicelli noodle bowl with grilled shrimp and an egg roll. Seriously, this cannot be beat. The vegetables are always fresh and crispy. The sauce is served on the side so you can keep it as light or heavy as you like. The shrimp are wonderfully seasoned and grilled, and I love the hot shrimp against the cold cucumbers and other veggies.\n\nJust writing this review makes me want to return right now.\n\nAlso, I've noticed sometime in the last few years they invested in the decor and have made it very nice inside."
"2","I've had a massage, a mani, and two pedis here.  All of my previous experiences have been par for the course.  My latest pedi turned in to a not so nice memory.  The technician cut my cuticle on my big toe and didn't even mention it to me.  I felt a little sting as she was cleaning the lotion off before using the polish - but I didn't think too much of it.  A week and a half later, I get to go to prompt care for an infected nail bed.\nI wouldn't be so upset about this if it had been from a strip mall nails joint, but from a day spa?  And the amount of money you have to pay for their service?  I'm going to think twice before visiting them for a pedi again."
"2","Towels are washed, but they have a smell to them. Carpets need to be replaced because they smell old and a bit moldy.  The linens need to be replaced because this duvet cover's zipper is broken so the down comforter is falling out of the duvet. \n\nMeatloaf at the hotel's restaurant was alright. Could have been better if the gravy wasn't too salty."
"5","Easily my favorite restaurant in Madison. Very attentive waitstaff. I've never had a dish here that I didn't like."
"1","I have eaten in Indian places all over the country and this place ranks up there with one of the worst.  The wait staff is nice, the water stayed full, but the food is dead avg at best.  One of the reasons I love Indian food is the depth of flavor.  Last night I had to salt the lamb dish b/c it was so flat.  We have left overs which is usually a hot commodity for lunch the next day.  Neither one of us have touched them.  I've just moved to Madison and this is my first time here, but I don't envision returning anytime soon."
"2","This rating does NOT reflect the fabulous selection at The Bean--that's amazing. I was irritated by the customer service. It STARTED well, with a lady greeting me as I came in the door and asking if I needed help finding anything. When I said no, the lady walked over to her associate, and the two proceeded to engage in an epic--riveting, I'm SURE--conversation that was still going on 10 minutes later, which is when I walked (unnoticed) out the door. The conversation transpired in the middle of a crowed aisle, which I, along with another patron, were having no small amount of difficulty navigating. The two were completely oblivious to the fact that we were trying to see (and move) PAST them. When the other patron met my eyes and shook her head in bewilderment, my suspicion that this is NOT normal behavior for business proprietors was confirmed. I didn't stick around any longer. I found what I needed at JoAnn's right around the corner."
"2","HOLY CRAP!!!\nOK, now before I get into a pissing match with anyone I just have to say this, the place is ridiculously expensive. \nI don't get why you have to spend almost $200 on 1 pair of jeans? I mean come on!! I guess I would expect this from a store like this, but it's mostly all graphic t-shirts and pants..I do like the style..but I mean everything in there is graphic-ified. haha.\nI did purchase a purse from there that I still wear today, but they are cheaply made. The lining of the purse tore open for some odd reason, I'm not ruff with my pruses and don't keep knives in there..all the time.. ;)~\nI do know they have a sale rack in the back that is unmarked which I found odd..basically you have to read the tag to find out how much your paying..it's always a good hunt! \nI'd say go in, look around, but don't waste your money on their clothes. Or purses. You can find better quality. ;)~"
"2","Crappy vegetarian selection. The few things I had were meh. Definitely needs better labeling for the buffet for noobies like myself."
"1","Burger King scews themself again!  Who is running this franchise?  They don't know what they are doing.  What I am referring to is that they took their best new burgers off their menu and went back to the old Whopper and basic blah.  What the heck!?  They got us back with their angus and Texas burgers and now they don't carry those anymore.  \nStaff is good and the store is clean and the fries are good.   This place is only good for some fries so why go here.  I suggest Wendy's or for something different Popeye's if you want fast food."
"4","I must say with the amount of business this Burger King does it has always been accurate, fast and declicious.\n\nThey have the best chicken sandwich (The Original) in town.\n\nI would have given 5 stars but, the trash can in the drive thru when you are exiting is always full and overflowing.  Who wants to drive over trash?  Not me....."
"2","I work very nearby this particular Steep & Brew, and it is consistently hit-or-miss, as contradictory as that sounds. However, my most urgent complaint is that the majority of the baristas have no urgency whatsoever. I often try to build an extra 10 minutes into my morning commute to grab a cup of coffee and a pastry, and I'm forced to wait for a full 7 minutes while the one barista available slowlyyyyy makes pour-over coffee and precisely steamed lattes. \n\nI know it's a small shop, but the priorities and sense of urgency here are non-existent. Why don't they have carafes of coffee to the side, so those who are there to just get a cup can fill up, pay at the counter and get out? \n\nI wouldn't be complaining about this if it weren't a frequent and extremely irritating occurrence. Whenever I go there, I'm there at least 10 minutes before I need to be at work less than a block away and end up at work late, ALWAYS, due to a cup of coffee taking at least 7 minutes to obtain. \n\nRidiculous. \n\nThat said, the cherry danishes ARE delicious."
"3","Grade: C-\n\nThe most over-rated restaurant in Madison. Decent food. Outrageous prices. Good service. How this place is still in business amazes me."
"4","one of our favs in Madison, very consistent and good, sister-in-law and mother-in-law were impressed last night"
"3","Grade: C-\n\nLess than average service. Almost okay food. Spendy."
"2","I had high hopes for this place but in the end, I did not have a great experience here. I went to collage a decade ago in Madison and Ginza was a thriving restaurant then. My memories of the hibachi here were very fond. Returning to Madison, I rarely get out to the west side, but I decided to make the trek out here to try it again.\n\nWalking into the restaurant, the place looked relatively slow. My wife and I I were told it would be 15-20 minutes for a hibachi table. We went to the bar and decided to order some sushi as an appetizer. After 30 minutes, we had not received our sushi and we were still sitting at the bar. I can understand if it is a busy Saturday night. This was a Tuesday night with about 15 people total in the restaurant. The hostess was less than courteous to say the least. When we finally received our sushi, we were told our table was ready.\n\nWe sat down at the hibachi table with some other strangers since it was just my wife and I. The hibachi performance was not inspiring and the food was bland. The sushi was decent. I read in the other reviews that sodas did not include free refills, but I did not test this.\n\nGinza has lost its luster and I won't be returning."
"1","Just ate here for the last time. Have gone here probably 20 times total in the past 4 years. Big fan of the sushi happy hour. However quality control is non existent. Found a hair in my salad, two out of my three sushi rolls were not made right and the crab in one tasted rotten. Totally disappointed. Check out VIP sushi next door. Much better and where I'll be taking my business from now on."
"4","The wash was quick and fairly inexpensive-- $10. Yes they missed a few spots on the dash but the rest of the car was vacuumed nicely and the outside looks great. Perhaps my expectations were low given the other reviews, but I'd go again."
"2","I should've written this review ages ago! For awhile I thought that this place was pretty good, but then I got a car wash over at Octopus on University. I then realized how good of a wash I should have been getting. Since then I haven't gone back. When Mermaid has a crazy deal, it's ok for the price. Otherwise I wouldn't recommend it. They just don't clean the interior as well as Octopus. Every employee I've dealt with is very, very nice though."
"1","Worst car wash I ever got. The inside of my car is still dirty and dusty doesn't even look like I got a car wash. Should of gone to octopus what a waste of 20 dollars"
"2","Someone needs to do some serious phone training at this location.I've ordered from here before, but they were never a staple for me. But my roommate was recently diagnosed with a gluten intolerance, and they prominently advertised a gluten-free crust option, so we started ordering from here instead of our preferred (pricier) pizza place.\n\nOrder #1: Took me 5 minutes to explain to the person taking my order over the phone that I wanted sausage added to a base special pizza. Really not that complicated. An hour and fifteen minutes pass, no pizza. Tried to call and inquire. Was immediately placed on hold and left there for 5 minutes. Hung up. Called back. Refused to let them immediately place them on hold (much to the person taking my call's surprise) and managed to ask my 15-second question. (I wanted to verify that the order had gone through, given the uncertainty level of the person who took it.)\n\nOrder #2: Placed online. Ordering system doesn't tell you an estimated timeframe of when your pizza will be ready for pickup. Called to ask. Was immediately placed on hold and left there for 3 minutes. Hung up. Called back. This time was actually allowed to talk to a human and ask my 5-second question. Went to pick up my pizza and watched them place someone else on hold indefinitely as we left even though no one was in line behind us.\n\nI know this is a nitpick, but it really is atrocious from a service standpoint, and guys, this ISN'T HARD. If you have a customer in front of you, put the caller on hold, and then help them before you take the next customer. If you're too slammed to do that, at least pick up the phone between customers and let the person you've put on hold indefinitely know that you haven't forgotten about them and someone will be with them shortly. This is sort of Retail Phone Service 101.\n\nThe pizza is fine. It's nothing spectacular, but it's good. Some of the toppings are interesting but overall it's good Basic Utility Pizza, the kind of thing you order if you're having a party and want something nicer than Pizza Hut. I like the calzones because they're the size of my head and last two meals easily, but they do usually arrive still cold in the middle. Overall, it's pretty underwhelming, and certainly not worth braving godawful service for. I might still snag a calzone every so often, but the phone manner the last few times had me googling whether our favorite place DID have gluten free crust after all, and lo and behold they do, so our actual pizza orders are headed right back to Roman Candle where they apparently should've just stayed."
"3","Nothing to go out of your way to get, but not bad if you're in a pinch. On my last visit I ordered the Hunan chicken, rated spicy but won't make you break a sweat. The veggies were colorful and seemed fresh. The chicken was white meat, not chewy and cooked just right. The sauce was salty like you'd expect at a hole-in-the-wall Chinese place, but not congealed. The fried rice was fine -- I've had much greasier -- but the egg rolls leave something to be desired. They seemed a little dry and lacked flavor. I was the only person in the restaurant and waited 5 minutes for them to finish my order while a couple other people came in to pick up their takeout. Decent place to grab some Chinese takeout when you're unprepared for dinner and sick of burgers or pizza, with service much faster than the location closer to home in Verona."
"4","To keep it short, they make consistently great coffee.\n\nI would recommended the Royale which is a double shot. I also bought a mocha for a friend who really enjoyed it as well.\n\nOnly downside? For a college campus coffeeshop, the prices are high and the sizes are small.\n\nGreat for a time to time treat :)"
"5","One of my absolute favorites in CU, Courier Cafe is the best place to relax and get some delicious American food. Old fashioned soda fountain favorites like phosphates and malt shakes make this place unique, but nearly everything is good. Sandwiches are on fresh bread,  and burgers are thick and hearty. There are a lot of vegetarian options- my favorite is the pesto grilled swiss on sourdough. I also love the ham melt on a fresh croissant. For dessert I recommend sharing a headliner, a monstrously delicious sundae drenched in hot fudge.\n\nFor the quality of food you get, this place is actually a bargain. I'd prefer it over most of CU's \""fine dining\"" establishments any day. Service can be slightly slow, but overall this is one of my favorite places to enjoy after a difficult test or a arduous paper-writing spree."
"3","Came here for a late lunch and was pretty disappointed by the service.  Our waiter took our order promptly enough and we received our food.  The sandwich I ordered was on the wrong bread and I spent what seemed like forever waiting for the waiter to come back around.  In the meantime I discovered that there was also a hair in the sandwich.  I eventually managed to flag him down and asked about the bread.  He took it back to the kitchen and when he came back, told me that they were out of the bread I ordered.  Ok...so why didn't someone come out and ask me what I wanted instead, rather than just making it with something else and hoping I wouldn't notice?  Seems pretty straightforward.  I got a new sandwich and by that time my boyfriend was almost done eating.\n\nAfter that, our waiter never bothered even stopping by our table again to check in, other than walking by to drop off the check.\n\nSandwich was good (...the second one, sans hair) although the \""special sauce\"" appeared to just be a mustard...maybe they were out of that too."
"5","By far the best place for breakfast in CU, and their coffee is always top notch. I've never had any qualms with the service, and never waited for over 5 minutes for a seat. Everyone's super friendly and I always leave in a great mood."
"2","Love the look and feel of the place but I've eaten better food. Came here for breakfast and it was alright, nothing great. The service here was fantastic."
"1","As so many other reviewers have stated, the owner has no respect for his customers. Condescending and patronizing are two good adjectives to describe his attitude. I would never support a store where the owner says \""the customer is almost never right\"", as he expresses on this YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_L1m1QIFTtg\n\nOne of the entries in the YoutTube Comments section is from a former employee, who expresses his admiration for his \""gruff, surly, obstinate\"" personality. Another former employee recalls with fondness how they liked to tell people off if they brought poor quality bikes, unless that customer was an attractive female. \n\nYou can find numerous other bike stores in the area where mechanics know their stuff too, but they will not abuse or mistreat you if you have an old rusty bike. It seems like the owner and the mechanics at Bikeworks only want to work on quality bikes (like the Bianchis they have in the store). Only that, with their discourteous attitude, they would not last in a world of elite bikes, where quality is also measured in terms of how you treat your customers.\n\nI guess that's why they are still at a whole-in-the-wall bike shop."
"2","This is NOT the place to go for your lunch hour. They are incredibly slow and they really don't care that they are. We were not ready to order when the waitress asked us the first time so she said she would come back in a few minutes. Yeah, more like 20 minutes!! \n\nI ordered the new bacon, mushroom and onion skillet and I loved it. It has an Alfredo sauce over potatoes, grilled mushrooms & onion, bacon and cheddar cheese. I know it sounds like a heart attack on a plate but it was so good. I had a blueberry muffin also and it came out hot with butter on the side. \n\nAlthough I was very pleased with the meal the reason I am giving such a low rating is for the service. I ran out of water and was looking for my waitress to ask for more. It took a really long time for her to show up again. It also took more than a half an hour for our food to come out of the kitchen after we ordered. With only an hour for lunch that is unacceptable."
"3","We had Lunch there on a Sunday ,pretty busy .\nI say the food is ok not a wow but ok.\nThe service was good and the place looked pretty clean .\nThey got lots to pick from. \nWe did wait a long time for are food.\nThe prices are not to bad either .\nI will give them another try maybe for dinner."
"3","Went here for an anniversary a while back with the idea that it was one of the nicer places in town. I did have high expectations and was a bit disappointed. I do like the rustic ambiance, but the menu has little to no imagination and the wine list is quite small. I would suggest the lobster Mac-n-cheese though."
"2","This was on graduation weekend and mother's day, so I am cutting them a little slack since they were busy.\n\nWe were able to get reservations for my wife's mom and decided it would be a great idea to take her out on mother's day. When we first got there it was pretty packed, it took five minutes before anyone at the counter acknowledge us.\n\nThey sat us down in a booth and an older waitress asked what we would like to drink, we ordered three cocktails and she asked us if we were in a hurry? No we are not, but thanks for asking...The drinks took ten minutes to come out, apparently we should have said we were in a hurry. \n\nFor the starters I got the Beef Tenderloin Carpaccio for myself and Shrimp Cocktail for my wife and her mom, both came out fast and were decent taste wise overall. The waitress to me seemed a little spacy and not quite there, we had numerous other waiters/waitresses stop by in between for refills and checking up on us since she wasn't.\n\nFor entrees we all ordered the Cider Brined \""Double Cut\"" Pork Chops, wait times were roughly 25-30mins. We were anxious to eat it as they were very thick chops, until my wife cut her pork chop open. The center of it was medium rare, borderline rare. Mine was a tad undercooked and also her moms, the waitress even commented and took it all back. They recooked it correctly and ten minutes later we received it back, the meal was above average and we enjoyed it.\n\nNow I normally would let this slip, but the manager proceeded to stop by our table and explain that is how they cook them at Silvercreek and well sorry. I guess the waitress isn't aware of this because she was the one to first point it out. If this is the case, it should be stated on the menu, totally unacceptable and unprofessional behavior as it wasn't really a legitimate apology. The manager there needs etiquette training, you do not act snooty like that to customers.\n\nThe desert we decided on was Caramel creme burlee and I have to say it was perfect. It made up a little bit for the disappointing experience, but hardly a reason to return only for that.\n\nOverall my experience was mostly negative with the service and how things operate there, they try to come off as upper scale but it falls flat. The location they are located it is a little bizarre, as right next door you have some sort of vehicle repair shop and things look a bit run down. For what we paid around $150ish and we did tip *More then we should have*, we did not get our moneys worth.\n\nI can't recommend Silvercreek for the service, location, and price. You will find better places to eat in the area."
"4","I went here on a number of occasions and was always super impressed with the speed and quality of care I recieved.\n\nFree cold-packs and condoms. What more could you ask for?!?"
"4","This is my favorite of all the Expresso Royale locations I have been to. It is in a lovely Spanish-style building and the interior has beautiful arches as well as all sorts of nooks and crannies for studying. The drinks (hot chocolate, coffee, etc.) are almost always good and they have all sorts of treats as well. At night it is sometimes filled with the aromas of baking pastries. Caveat- it can get darn crowded and during peak hours it can be hard to find a plug for laptops."
"5","This Espresso is definitely the best Espresso Royale at U of I. The baristas are AWESOME and have GREAT senses of humor. The new manager has really stepped it up in terms of making it a really interesting and charasmatic place to be ( if a store could be charasmatic). If you're used to starbucks and their sweet sweet coffee, it'll take some time to get used to the drinks but in the long run its what coffee should taste like. The enviornment is worth it in itself and the pastries are baked and sandwiches are made fresh everyday. Plus their soups kick @ss. love it."
"1","So, I was all set to give this bar a solid four stars...\n\nThey feature live music quite a bit.  Been here once a few times recently.  The first seeing a band from Austin.  It's a solid, clean, neighborhood spot a half step above dive.  The drinks are good, and fairly priced.  They don't have a lot of beer on tap.\n\nThe other time there, it happened to be a night where they had the grill going, on Mondays I believe.   Me and two friends each had a dinner platter of various steaks with sides.  The meat was tasty and well done, though not spectacular.  All the sides were fairly good.\n\nThe food was an excellent value for the price point.  Checking out the menu we saw that their other, daily basis, menu items were at really reasonable prices as well\n\nJust a nice four star kinda bar, until after our visit last night.  Five housemates, two ate the burger.  Others had veggie burger, and the chili dog.  \n\nThe fries are pretty great.  Upon noticing the menu claimed the fries were baked, and not greasy, MrT asked why anyone would want them.  But despite the non-greasy they were fairly fantastic.\n\nYou can ask for a side of their house BBQ sauce.  Not bad flavor, but it is a mainly straight black pepper taste; not quite a true thicker multi-flavored typical BBQ.\n\nEverything tasted great, everyone was happy.  All set to give the Iron Post a solid four stars.\n\nUntil a few hours after we got home.  The burger dinner folks BOTH had food poisoning!\n\nOne of the food poisoned has stated since that her six week recovery from heart surgery was less painful than her case.  She ended up having to go to the hospital for it.\n\nSo, be warned.  Maybe stick with sides or veggie options here?  Don't know if I'd ever go meat here again!  \n\nI'd give the place another chance, steering(huhuh) clear of the meat.  I would give the bar more stars, but can't forgive the disgustingly, painfully stricken."
"2","\""Three raviolis in my dish?! This better be the appetizer portion!!\""\n\nMy experiences with TImpone's are fairly inconsistent. Food is not bad tasting in any way, but I always leave just a little dissatisfied. Portions are incredibly small and well, if you wanna be \""that kind of place\""...you should move out of Champaign. It's fine for a date, business dinner, something of that sorts, but definitely not the kind of place I'd keep coming back to."
"5","Last night, while thinking about this place, I actually started to drool. I'm not kidding...then I vowed to write a review the next day.\n\nGo on sundays and get the half chicken special, comes with a HUGE drink and bread. Get the lemonade drink. Sometimes, I wish I could just buy their sauce (which I think you actually can) and just pour it on everything I eat. Their sauce is what makes their food delicious."
"1","You know how they have all those television commercials saying, \""If you have a job, we'll put you in a car?\""  This is supposed to be regardless of credit history or location of said job.  I took it for what it was worth, and provided a legitimate job offer to them, one with a starting salary of $55,000/yr, in the door.  I know I have a bad credit rating, as I am still recovering from filing a Chapter 7 Bankruptcy just over 2 years ago, so I am expecting a higher interest rate, which I will have no problem paying to re-establish my credit rating.\n\nI was told that my possible trade-in car wasn't worth much as a trade-in, but if I could come up with $1,000 as a down payment, they would be willing to waive the trade-in requirement and pre-approve me to get into a newer car.  I took the salesman at his word and found a third party individual who was in dire need of a car, and he bought my car for over $1,000.  I called up my insurance company to put in notice that I was purchasing a newer car and needed to upgrade my State minimum to full coverage.  My premium was duly increased, but since I was still covered until the middle of July, I didn't have to make any payments until next month, so all is well so far.\n\nI find out my loan was approved by the bank, but there was a small hiccup:  The bank would not release the funds to the dealer until the first day of my new job.  The new job starts on June 6th, 2011, and the dealer's owner decides at the last moment that he doesn't want to approve the deal because, Heaven forbid, the new job is in Washington, DC...700+ miles away from the middle of nowhere.  The dealer is afraid that just because I have a job offer, it doesn't mean I have been hired, and if I take their 2003 Mercury Grand Marquis to Washington, D.C. and am unable to pay for my car, they have no way of getting their car back.\n\nSo I am now left out in the cold, without a car from O'Brien, without a car that was actually running because I had let someone else purchase it from me, expecting to get a newer car, and now I have to take a bus or train to Washington, DC with just a duffle bag full of clothes and $1,000 in my pocket.  Thanks O'Brien, your false advertisements made such a difference in my life.  So where's the fine print saying that the customer's job offer has to be within 150 miles of the dealer?"
"5","I just purchased a new (2012) Toyota Tacoma through O'Brien Auto Park.  I contacted their online representative (Matthew Shanks) via Email and got a very good price comparable to the best of other dealers in the state which I had contacted.\n\nSince this was a special order,  he was very helpful in getting the paperwork arranged and it was completely without the usual \""talk to the manager\"" and other salesmen's games - a simple business deal at a good price.\n\nIt's a pity that more dealerships don't consider this business model - honest, unstressful and building value for both parties.  Thumbs up for Matt and O'Brien."
"4","I am not vegan or vegetarian but my friend is so I went with him and thought I would try it. I had the BBQ seitan and for someone who doesn't eat that type of thing normally it was actually pretty good. It had the look, feel, and taste of bbq pork. I also had a side salad that had a yummy herb vingearatte. I don't think I would go back again because I like my meat but it was definitely tasty and if you are looking for a vegetarian type of place definitely go check it out!!"
"2","I really wanted to like this place, being both vegetarian and right next to my building.  After several visits though, I had to concede that it just isn't that good.  Tables are constantly dirty.  Food is inconsistent, too expensive for the quality and portion size, and generally not very tasty.\n\nThe employees are in a constant state of confusion, seemingly overwhelmed by the trickle of customers during the lunchtime \""rush\"".  The ordering process is inefficient, with very little thought put into organization of the process.\n\nBasically, this place has all of the drawbacks of a small, quirky cafe, with virtually none of the payoff.  \n\nI am currently at the restaurant again, having given in to proximity over quality, and I am regretting it."
"5","Have nothing but incredible things to say about the Canopy Club. I came up for my birthday weekend to see a few DJ's perform, expecting nothing more than to be the average customer. I got to be back stage during sound check, during the concert, went to the Green Room for free booze. All in all, they put me up in there like I was Donald Trump. This is mostly a thanks to Positive Vibr8ions who really took care of me, but every employee and anyone associated with the Canopy was so kind and cool to me. It was truly the best 72 hours of my life (went to Wed night and Fri night concert).\n\nTo all that were complaining, and rated anything lower than a 4. You were either not on enough E, not able to take home a girl/boy, or both. #ShutupAndDance"
"1","I came here once to buy a Camelbak, of which they had none, \""because everyone just buys them on the Internet now \"". Well yes, if you don't have any in your store, people will buy them on the Internet.\n\nThen, I came here once at 5:45 PM before trying to go mountain biking and intending to buy some cycling gloves. They were closed. I don't know what kind of idiotic bike shop owner thinks they can just stay open until 5:30 and stay in business. Hey idiotic owner, a lot of your customers are going to be working people. If you ever expect them to shop at your store, you're going to need to stay open a little later.\n\nOr don't, and just go out of business. Maybe a shop that is actually helpful will open in your place."
"1","Bad experience and service.  I made a reservation here that I needed to cancel.  I cancelled it more than 5 months before I was supposed to stay and they charged my credit card saying I was a no show.  I emailed the hotel 3 times and got no response at all.  I called and talked to someone who said they have no record of me canceling.  When I asked to talk to a manager the girl on the phone said the manager Cassie would call me back.  Never got a call.  I called their corporate office to try and resolve this but I think I will have to end up disputing the charge on my credit card.  What a pain!"
"3","Greasy bar food at it's finest. I was craving nachos. They didn't have them. It was a sad day, but I got another greasy meal in place of my much desired nachos. The food was fine, prices, were awesome, seating was scary. Asses to elbows. We couldn't move without accidentally feeling someone up or getting ourselves violated. Small price to pay for a quick lunch."
"5","The Bread Company is one of my favorite restaurants, and is one of the things I miss most about U of I.  I ate here frequently as a student and as an alumna I make sure to stop in every time I return to campus.  The atmosphere of the restaurant makes me feel like I'm taken away from the stress of every day life.  They have a fireplace in the corner and white lights strung up to make it feel romantic, but it is modernized with the art that they have on the walls.  My husband and I usually share an order of cheese fondue and a gourmet pizza.  The Bread Company offers a nice selection of wine and beer, including wine by the carafe.  I can't forget to mention their selection of fresh baked cookies.  The sables and chocolate macaroons are delicious.  Great atmosphere, delicious food, and reasonable prices - I love this place!"
"3","I popped in here once for lunch last summer, on the recommendation of my nutrition professor.  Our chat on carbs and training for races and triathlons led to \""you HAVE to go to the Bread Company!\"" \n\nThough this overly subtle carb stop doesn't have a sign (anymore?) on its exterior, it can be identified by the variety of wine bottles lining the window sills.  There's a variety of sandwiches for the lunch hour, but I hit the Bread Company tonight, and my, do they swank it up for dinner.\n\nDim lights, plentiful menu of pasta-pizza-sandwich options, and extensive specials list, including tapas.  Who knew?  \n\nI had the roast beef sandwich, served atop roasted potatoes and a light salad.  I think all of the sammies are served up open faced, so open your mouth, and get ready for a carbolicious meal."
"3","When our department has to entertain guest speakers or job candidates, The Bread Company always becomes the default dinner/lunch location.  Embarrassingly, I've heard some job candidates comment that they were taken here for 3 different meals during their visit!  My department is probably at fault for their lack of imagination when choosing restaurants, but The Bread Company offers some benefits that elevate it to a top pick for business-casual university diners:\n\n(1) Location.  For people who have short lunch periods and need to be within walking distance of campus, this restaurant's location is unbeatable.  (And since it's next door to an Espresso Royale, you can grab a coffee after your meal, if desired.)\n\n(2) Atmosphere.  Most college restaurants resemble a McDonald's Playroom for adolescents: neon walls and heavy-duty plastic furniture, with underlying scents of urine and vomit.  While The Bread Company does have a hint of grunge, it also invokes a strong sense of urban, artistic chic.  There are real paintings on the wall (not poster prints).  At night, they bring out white tablecloth and mood lighting.\n\n(3) Price.  I think the prices are reasonable depending on who you ask.  This place IS pricey when compared to most campus restaurants, where students are always trying to squeeze their dollars.  Lunch generally runs around $7 to $10, which is not unreasonable when entertaining guests.  (And still comparable/cheaper than what you can get at Timpone's, the other \""nice\"" restaurant in the area.)\n\nAll of the food is fairly conservative, with obvious combinations of flavors (brie + portobello, turkey + pesto, etc.).  I think this is also a reason that it ranks highly among options for guests; you will find nothing offensive here in terms of food (but also nothing exciting).  The presentation tends to be elegant and you can tell that most of the ingredients are of good quality.\n\nFor lunch, I always go with the egg salad, which is creamy, well-seasoned, and always satiates my craving for egg goodness.  In the early evening, sometimes I stop by for a beer and appetizer with friends.  The cheese selection is quite good (you'll find Stilton, Gouda, Manchego, etc.), and the beers are all microbrews (if you're into that kind of thing).  Dinner selections include fondue, pastas, pizzas, and some specialties, but the prices are on par with more interesting restaurants in downtown Champaign/Urbana.\n\nIn terms of baked goods, I am quite fond of ordering my sandwiches here with sourdough or rye bread.  Yum!  At most places with a baking reputation, I always find myself enticed by the sweet buns and cookies, but I almost never find myself tempted by the ones at The Bread Company.  Their treats always look colorless and hardened, as if they were made by an angry grandma.\n\nOverall, I'd recommend this to people who like simple, light food.  If you are cheap and don't care about indie street cred, you could probably get the same food at Panera."
"2","I went with a Chinese friend who ordered in Chinese.  When one of the dishes arrived and she didn't like the look of it she then shouted a lot at the waiter (in Chinese).  After that the food was exceptional.  Easily the best Chinese food I've had in Central Illinois.  (I admit, that's a low standard.)\n\nHowever, I've never been able to recreate this experience.  And how I've tried!  I ended up asking my Chinese friend to write me a note in Chinese ordering these same dishes from the Chinese menu.  I show the crumpled and worn note to the waiter when I go by myself.  But the food is never as good.  I expect it was the shouting.  Now that my friend has moved away, I expect it will never be that good again.\n\nWithout my friend to help us, this is a mediocre place."
"3","It's okay.  It's large, lots of room.  But the tables are tiny.  They have free wifi, but everyone connects to power strips and extension cords that are strewn about haphazardly.  Watch out so you don't trip.  And people would unplug your computer if you weren't paying attention.  It looks more like a dorm area than a business.\n\nThe tables and chairs are mismatched, which I'm sure is the style they're going for.  It would be cute if it just had something a little more to connect everything together, instead of a bunch of furniture thrown in.  It looks like left-overs from the dorms and frats that surround the area.  And it was sort of dirty.  Like dusty.  And the windows weren't clean.  And flies.  I can't stand trying to study with flies buzzing around me.  It's sort of the little things that can make a place be \""wow.\""  \n\nAnd the coffee was, in my opinion, rather overpriced.  Very good, but I was a little miffed at paying over $2 for a 16 oz. house coffee.  I guess because it's closer to the school they can over charge.  But my friend loves that brand of coffee, so we go there.\n\nI don't know, the potential is totally there.  It would be better if they kept it cleaner and more organized, and wiped the tables down on occassion.  But they do seem to have good hours - open until 11pm I think.  And the people behind the counter were nice."
"2","- Overrated\n- Expensive\n- Hipsters\n\nThree strikes and you're out, Caffe Paradiso."
"3","It's hard to evaluate the merits of a coffee shop based on a french soda, but this place seems pretty good. It cost about $3 which is a bit pricey, but tasted good, and the syrups they use are good quality.\n\nI'd have to keep going here and grab a coffee to see how the place is on the whole."
"3","I'm moving out of town and very sorry to be leaving Paradiso behind. Their coffee is Intelligentsia, their tea is Rishi, and they make the best (brewed, not from a bottle) chai latte in Chambana. It's my writing and reading spot, I love it, and the people-watching is especially entertaining after a big campus party or football game.\n\nBut there are some downsides: \n\n* Yes, the coffee is expensive. I think it's worth it, especially when I'm planning to sit for awhile and essentially renting table space. Many disagree.\n* The best time to write at Paradiso is during breaks or in the summer when campus empties out. During the semester, it can be loud and hard to get a table, and the internet is slow when there's a ton of students procrastinating by watching youtube.\n* The food is fine, but generally unexceptional. The pastries and soups are the best bet (macarons and corn chowder - yum! - not together, of course), and they  always have a variety of vegetarian options."
"2","One of the worse chocolate fraps. It was bitter, to syrupy, and over-priced. I do not recommend this place"
"4","Excellent setup and ambience. Great selection of cakes and pastries. Amazing selection of teas. Quite a list of coffees. This place is probably the most \""real\"" coffee shop. I had the affogato and cappuccino and both were good. You can also get a sandwich and pick the bread and ingredients. It's good but tastes like a regular sandwich, nothing special."
"2","NO NO NO!\n\nThis is not how a great bakery should be!\n\nOk, let me begin:\n\n1)   The staff are generally either not familiar with what they're selling (what's a brioche?) or not interested.  Some of them have been friendly, but there have been times I've felt bad for interrupting their phone call!\n\n2)  The bread is DELICIOUS!  But, if you're trying to have a \""french style\"" bakery, you need more than nice bread to save you.  Plus, the baguette is generally as old as what the french hand out to the homeless.  \n\n3)  The pastries are really not worth the price.  They're expensive (a french chocolate cake is too expensive to even try!) and the cost of other items doesn't meet the quality.\n\nAside from the price, the pastries are too heavy on the crust and too light on the flavor.  For example, a blueberry tart will have a crust 2 times too thick for the amount of filling.  You would NEVER find that in France, as the fruit is the star and the tasteless crust just transports it to your mouth.\n\n4)  Ehh...yeah...it's local.  But, not all that great.\n\nI'd rather go to Pekara.  At least the staff are friendlier, the bread is just as good and the pastries are reasonable in price."
"4","For years, I longed for a truly fine bakery in Urbana-Champaign, and then Jack Kostrub opened Mirabelle Fine Pastry.  The bakery produces exceptional loaves and pastries, both savory and sweet.  We are special fans of the focaccia, from the traditional flat loaves topped with sea salt and rosemary or red onions and tomatoes, to the thick wedges piled with feta cheese and roasted veg.  \n\nThe almond horn, tipped with chocolate, I purchased yesterday is an example of the quality of the bakery's sweets.  The outside had a slight crunch of roasted almond slices, while the inside was dense, moist, and chewy and tasted of the most delicate amaretto.  The chocolate was darkly sweet, perfectly complementing the almond flavor.  Heavenly.  \n\nPlus, Mirabelle is located in Urbana's gallery district, with the wonderful Heartland Gallery just down the block, among other treasures.  If you'd like lunch, too, you can hop right across the street to La Gourmandise.  Or, you can get take-away at Mirabelle, which includes savory stuffed croissants and simple, delicious baguette and loaf bread sandwiches.\n\nOn Fridays at lunchtime, the bakery recently started a piled high roast beef sandwich tradition, steeped in au jus.  I have not had one yet, but a local business owner sends in his folks every week to pick up a batch -- they swear by them.\n\nMy only complaints: 1) popular items run out early, 2) flies, flies, flies in the bakery and cases (especially in the summer, when the door is propped), 3) somewhat surly and negligent counter service."
"2","Sometimes you can get great core service, but some ancillary thing can leave such a bad taste in your mouth you just don't ever want to go back.\n\nI went into Mirabelle's this morning for a big ol cup of coffee and a lil snacky. I was greeted by a pleasant girl and purchased a delish pastry. They don't have large coffees (and their French Roast is FAR inferior to other places in town). Total on the pastry and not large coffee: $4.25. About a dollar more than I would have liked, but not out of this world expensive. Straight out of low cash, I whip out the card and she drops the bomb: $5 minimum on credit card purchases.\n\nI recognize I am being a bit melodramatic by freaking out about this, but tactics like these by retailers are in violation of their agreements with the credit card companies and they really piss me off. Consumers are third party beneficiaries of these contracts: we pay (in more ways than one) for our credit cards and all the good stuff that comes with them. I fully understand why retailers do this, as credit card companies charge a percentage on all transactions, with minimum charges on smaller purchases. The minimum charges are more significant on small-dollar transactions. I get that. Stores don't have to play the minimum purchase amount game, though. The have other options, such as offering a discount for cash transactions or not accepting cards at all. They also can empower their clerks to waive the limit if the customer balks.\n\nSo, the net result? You already know this chubby bastard ordered another pastry. It was also tasty. However, I ended up spending almost $7 all told when all I wanted was a (larger and better) cup of coffee and a lil snacky."
"5","I just have to update this to say that they no longer have a minimum for credit card purchases.  Love their spinach and feta croissants!"
"3","I've gone to Mirabelle's since it first opened, and have experienced the highs and not so highs among their products. Generally-the baked goods are excellent if you do not need to know the ingredients (we're talking butter and sugar here), but one problem they have consistently had has been their customer service. It is often the case among local businesses that the manager or owner fails to see that the 'face' (or 'faces') of the business are those people serving the customers, and that they need to be trained beyond using Square and putting food in the bags. They should be 'there' mentally, know how to spot the first customer in line, and put the correct items in the bag or box. If there are a lot of customers, why not get a number device? Sometimes the line goes out the door, or customers would like to look into the display case first, but they cannot see it because of the crowd in front of them until it is their turn, and then they spend time trying to choose while people behind them wait. The customers in Urbana are a pretty civilized bunch, but owners will never know when they have lost a customer who does not return. I often get the feeling among local owners that if they are making enough profit, then that's it, no need to improve. However, there are always new businesses opening up and new competition. \nBeyond the products I suggest looking at: \n1.) training staff to be friendlier and more responsive to customers. \n2.) cleaning that place like it is a surgery. \n3.) Innovate products-try coming up with items that are not so heavy or hard to eat. For example-the sandwiches are made from baguette-fine, but they are so hard they cut the roof of your mouth. In France, Italy, and many other places, they scrape out the inner part of the bread to leave the shell for the sandwich filling, and wrap it tightly overnight, where it softens. \n4.) Offer ingredient lists for products.\n5.) Use social media to create enthusiasm for new products."
"4","My favorite place in town.  I started going there because I live close by.  The food is excellent - slightly creative pub style.  Excellent beer selection - rotating taps mean you'll always find something new.  Waitstaff seem to have been turning over a lot lately, which can lead to inconsistent service.  Usually good, though."
"2","Don't order the fish here, it's clearly frozen, not fresh. I've been to this restaurant several times with groups. While there's a decent drink/beer selection, it seems like most of the time alot of the food items on the menu are not available. The one thing I do love about this place is their sweet potato fries, which is topped with brown sugar. This is definately more of a bar + snacks kind of place and not so much a sit-down restaurant though they try. And as far as bars go, there are less expensive and better, elsewhere in town."
"1","I didn't buy my dress at Michelle's, only rented tuxes there, so I cannot speak for the dress buying experience at Michelle's.\n\nDO NOT rent tuxes from them. DO NOT! If you think about renting them there and speak with someone named Monica, run! I live about 3 hours from Champaign but had my wedding in Champaign, and I spent a lot of (needless) time emailing back and forth with Monica. For some reason I had to repeat things over and over...she definitely was not really reading my emails or just has really bad reading comprehension because she would ask the same questions over and over....things I had already answered. When I talked to her on the phone she seemed very scatterbrained.\n\nThe day of the wedding all of the guys were wearing different styles of vests!!! They were all the correct color (black...kind of hard to mess that part up), but they were all different styles! Apparently after the long string of emails she still couldn't get it right.\n\nMy friend recently got married she also dealt with Monica and all the guys ended up with the wrong shoes - she had ordered them the wrong ones! She was told Michelle's would give her a refund for the shoes, but she hasn't seen it yet."
"2","It is hard to want to shop at a store that allows the cashiers to be on thier cell phones while customers are in line waiting to check out. Briana turned to her cell phone and was playing with it twice with the costumer ahead of me and then again when I was checking out. She would have rather ed answered her text then take my money for my purchases. I'm not sure if safeway corp. Is aware that there are other stores around that people will go shop at when the employees care more about thier cell phones than customer service. Maybe safeway needs to impliment  a no cell phone policies  while working. Or stop hiring these kids that think they are entitled. With so many people unemployed I bet there are a lot of people that would love a job with a safeway and I bet they would do better customer service and have respect for the company and the customers."
"1","I've already posted this review for the location at Bell and 7th Ave, but thought I needed to post it again since we took our dog here, too.\n\nThis \""pet hospital\"" is a scam and a total waste of money. Their vets seem like they barely passed vet school. We took our wonderful dog, Duke, into them when he developed a lump on his side. After taking x-rays, blood tests, etc., the vet told us that the lump was \""a medical mystery\"". Prior to this, we had signed up for their pet wellness plan. In short, we took our dog to a reliable, trustworthy vet (Dr. Ryan at Blue Cross Vet Clinic) and it turned out he had bone cancer :-(. He ended up passing away this summer, yet my husband and I are still being forced to pay for our Banfield pet wellness plan each month, even though our dog is dead. Thanks, Banfield."
"1","This place does not care at all about your animal!  We had our beloved dog there for years and he developed an issue.  I called them for help one day and they did not care one bit.  I had to rush him to another vet which did all they could, but we lost him.  When Banfield found out, they didn't even call us to apologize or offer condolences.  Then, on top of everything, they still continued to charge us monthly for his health plan!  Every time you call, they put you on hold forever too.  They are horrible and I will never, ever return!!"
"4","I have taken my 4 cats to this hospital and never had any problems/ issues. \nThe staff is always friendly, caring and patient. From the front desk to the vet- everyone truly cares for my animals. The vet takes time to explain whats going on with my pet and discuss the treatment options. We've done surgeries at this hospital on two of the strays and the care was wonderful! I was worried all day and the staff let me go back and check on the kittens to ease my anxiety as they were recovering from surgery. \nA couple of times we've had emergencies and they were able to fit us in right away. The only reason I'm not giving a \""five star\"".. is the cost. I don't have the insurance, we pay as we go, and it gets to be a bit pricey-meds, tests.  I would totally recommend this hospital."
"1","I take my Yelp reviews very seriously.  To me, giving someone a one star yelp review means that they have done something so egregious, that someone either did or could have gotten hurt as a result.  Oh wait...that's exactly what happened.  I recently flew into Phoenix with my brother, his husband and their 11 month old baby for a family wedding.  We rented an SUV with a car seat.  Initially, my brother asked if the car seat could be installed for them, as they were unfamililar with this model, and they were told company policy dictates that they could not install the seat.  Fine.  No big deal.  We install the seat and off we go to our hotel to rest up for the drive to Sedona the next day.  \n\nMy brother's husband had a nagging feeling about the seat that just wouldn't go away.  Finally, he drove to the local police station to have it inspected and we were informed that Hertz had neglected to include the base of the carseat and that it was in fact, unsafe to hold a child.  A quick call to Hertz later and I KID YOU NOT, we were informed that it was not negligence on their part, it was negligence on our part for driving off with the car seat that they had provided.  Are you counting?  We have two strikes so far.  Massive error that could have led to death of child (that's gotta count for at least 10 strikes though...right) and then complete failure to take responsibility or attempt to fix the problem.  The bro in law located a nearby Hertz location, and they said we could come and pick up a new seat.  They gave us a new seat, they sure did.  Once again, I kid you not, this one was missing clips.  \n\nWe made our way back to the original Hertz location at the airport.  The staff were rude, and spent a great deal of time rolling their eyes at us when we asked them for assistance putting a strange car seat into a car that we'd never seen before.  I understand they can't actually install it for liability purposes, but I can't believe that no one else has struggled to install an unfamiliar seat in an unfamiliar car.  Regardless, we never once received an apology, just continued rude behavior and eye rolls.  I travel often and have never encountered such poor customer service and lack of concern for safety at a car rental agency.  You can be sure that Hertz will never receive mine, my family's or any of my friends' business again.  You can bet that they will never receive the business of random people who I run into on the street.  This is how infuriated I am by their negligience and egregious mishandling of the whole situation."
"3","This is your typical Barnes & Noble's large footprint store.  I am unsure if this is their largest store, the one in Chandler Fashion seems larger.\n\nBarnes & Nobles suffers from the same affliction as Best Buy.  If Best Buy is Amazon's showroom, then so is B & N.  The book industry has changes quite a bit over the years, due primarily to the internet.  Gone are the Borders of the world, a friendlier and easier to maneuver store.  But if you are looking for volume and sheer size, this might be the best place.\n\nWe have been coming to this B & N for the last five years.  All the employees are very helpful, and Four Stars in my opinion.  It's convenient for from my office and it seems as if we're in here at least twice a month on weekends.  \n\nI know at this point,  I am tired of the Nook sales pitch as you come through the door.  At some point, I'm sure Microsoft will just buy the other 50% they do not own and that will end it. Hopefully.\n\nSo in summary, this Barnes & Nobles is Thee Stars, A-OK."
"5","My dog, Riley, is a total disaster of a dog. She's so pretty, but there's not much there in the way of smarts. But we love her!\n\nSo when she was bitten by a rattlesnake, I of course raced her here for treatment. The staff are extremely knowledgable, smart, friendly and forthcoming with information. They told me upfront that this was going to be expensive and all the different options. No beating around the bush, nothing vague or general, just to the point. It was great, totally got the hard part out of the way. \n\nShe was treated with kindness by people who obviously love animals. Yes, it was expensive, about $1700, but obviously completely worth it. \n\nSo remember when I said Riley isn't the smartest? Yeah, well two days after the rattler incident, she ate a bottle of midol. I again found myself back in the clinic. Most of the staff remembered her and treated me and her with the utmost in professionalism and concern. \n\nThat was another $650. (I love my dog.. i love my dog...I love my dog .. I keep reminding myself...).\n\nOy. Well anyway. I would reccommend this clinic to anyone with a pet in distress."
"5","The Staff at this location were SO nice and supportive when I brought my dying cat in early this morning. It is nice to have caring and empathetic animal people around when you have to go through this. I deal with this loss a lot in my line of work, but my own pets are my babies and this does not get easier. Thank You Scottsdale Staff for everything on this sad day."
"4","I took my CCW class here and the instructor was very knowledgeable.  No complaints here and he made me a more accurate shooter.  What more could you ask for?"
"1","Taking this class was one of the worst experiences I have ever had! I can't believe I actually paid for this abuse and to watch others be talked down to and abused! This guy Rick Barkett was the most rude, inconsiderate and belittling excuse for a human I have ever had the displeasure of meeting. He made even asking a question something you did not want to do because if you did you would be made to feel stupid for asking. Fortunatley for me, I already knew everything he was paid to teach me and I got the certificate I needed. I wish I would have looked into this guy before taking this class. Taught me that I should be on here more often!"
"1","I booked this hotel with the hopes of a relaxing weekend by the four pools.  I booked through Perfect Escapes because of the free room upgrad and early check in.  When my boyfriend and I arrived at the hotel, we were told it would be 30-60 min before our room was ready.  Not a huge deal, so we had the bell desk hold our bags and decided to check out the pool area.  As soon as we walked outside we hear extremely loud jackhammering going on.  They were using jackhammers at what looked like two of the four pools.  It was so loud we could stand side by side and not hear each other and it stirred up so much dust it was hard to see.  We immediately asked inside how long it would be going on.  They then told us it would be going on the entire weekend until 4 p.m. each day.  There was no indication of construction on the resort website or perfect escapes. Disappointing after $45 cab ride to the resort and then another $45 cab ride to another resort after then paying to use the hotel internet to find another resort.  I go to the Phoenix area often and have staid at Camelback Inn, Hyatt Gainey Ranch and Hotel Indigo.  All were wonderful accomodations.  From the look of this hotel on several websites, it was quite beautiful and relaxing and very comparable to the other resorts in the area.  Unfortunately, I never even made it to the room due to the construction.  It was not the relaxing weekend I had planned for.  The construction should have been disclosed on all websites linked to the hotel."
"2","I came here on a business trip I was less than impressed. They claim to be the #1 Sheraton in the nation for hospitality and quality service's....haha! Upon checking in they decided to hold my debit card for $200 a night in case of incidentals. Now if you have a credit card, they won't change you anything...rediculous! When I explained that I was on a business trip and that there would be no incidentals, the GQ guy behind the counter said \""it's policy and if you don't like it, then you don't have to stay\"". I asked to speak to a manager and he told me no one was available...yeah right!! I think he was just on a power trip. \n\nThe room was nice nonetheless, but it smelled like smoke...grose! Especially for someone who has never smoked. But they made it a point to tell me it was a nonsmoking room while checking in and with the signs/cards all over the room. \n\nAlso, don't bring your gym cloths unless you want to take a hike to the facility (seriously) and then pay $20/day when you get there. Something they don't tell you on their website. \n\nThe pool is really cool, especially for kids with the twisty slide. They also have a fire pit to roast marshmallows. The best part of the whole trip was the boat ride to the Rawhide Ranch. The Ranch was ehh, but the boat driver was a riot with his awesome serenading voice. He is the reason for the additional star and that is it! \n\nI'm sure glad that I wasn't footing the bill otherwise I would have been super disappointed."
"2","Very disappointed. The grounds were nice, the food was good, and the service was hospitable and friendly. However, $13/day for wired Internet in the room, and $20/day to use the fitness center? And even worse, the rooms will never, ever get colder than 68F, even if you set the thermostat to 60F. Yes, I called to complain that my room was warm, even when the thermo was set to it's coldest setting of 60F. They sent a tech who adjusted the vents and then said that they have green-friendly thermostats that are pre-programmed to not let the room get colder than 68F, and that they get frequent complaints, even from staff. What did they do about it? Nothing except to offer to bring me a small fan and offer apologies. If you like a cool room to sleep in, this is not the place. \nAnd the walk to some of the rooms is long, which isn't an issue if you have time on your hands (which I didn't - I was here for a conference). There are much better values around the US, I would skip this place altogether."
"3","Recently stayed at this resort for a staycation and have to say it was a very comfortable stay. Rooms are nice and clean, staff is all very friendly and helpful and the beds are very comfortable. The resort is well kept and the pool area is nice. \n\nFor the price per night, the resort should at the very least offer a FREE continental breakfast in the morning. We were told that we could not bring in any food or drink into the pool area as long as the restaurant/bar area is open for business. And it is open for business until about 8pm. The resort also charges an EXTRA $20 per night fee for internet, computer and gym use and it is NOT optional!! I think you should be able to opt out of this fee and you cant!\n\nAlso didn't like that the parking lot was SOOO far away from the resort. For elderly people or for anyone in the summer this can be killer walking to and from your car.\n\nOverall the stay was great but just expected more for the amount of money you spend to stay here."
"2","Lost baggage and poor child wrangling. It's all about employee empowerment.\n\nI have the patience of the Madonna - all right maybe more like the Material Girl - but I am pretty laid back. After my humbling experience in the wine industry, I've been much more appreciative of service industry related jobs. But when employees are not empowered to answer the most simple of questions, and we're checking in on machines with nobody around to handle luggage, well...it's a disaster waiting to happen. It's an unfortunate thing that is supposed to help in keeping costs down and help with efficiency - but there's been consistent problems with all of my US AIRWAYS flights.\n\nLet's throw JFK airport into the mix to help maximize the disaster...we ended up in Orlando. Waiting for our luggage. Luckily our toddler was entertained with the luggage roundabout...because we waited through two flight arrivals to retrieve one bag. \n\nFamily that met up with us for the 4th assured us US AIRWAYS used a really efficient delivery service...Apparently the lost luggage situation is pretty common.\n\nGood thing the baby bug is a trooper when it comes to traveling - because Orlando trips tend to be family-heavy and the on-board US AIRWAYS staff consistently doesn't seem too thrilled to be dealing with even the well-behaved ones."
"1","This is the WORST airline ever. I will gladly be herded onto Southwest like some fat ass cattle rather than ever endure the torture of US Airways again.\n\nHow can any businesses possibly be such a mess? Ever since they were merged with craptastic America West it's been downhill. Every person from the counter bitches to the flight attendants were out of control rude. It's clear this airline does not value their customers.  The flight attendants were so rude on my last flight that it shocked me. \n\nAnd now you want to charge me $30 for an aisle seat. Fuck you!\n\nAnd don't tell me it's just the industry that's taking a dive because riding on Jet Blue is like going to freaking Disneyland! Polite customer service people, happy flight attendants, snacks, tv's, on time arrivals.... dignity."
"2","Ghetto. Classless. Surly-ass crew that needs a reality check on how to work in a service-oriented profession. \n\nGet this: the reading lights above my seat would not go out. On a 9 hour red-eye flight to Europe. They just wouldn't turn off. There were a few other seats with the same problem. So what did the stewardess do? She stuck a styrofoam cup over the light. \""THERE.\""\n\nNever again."
"3","I would not recommend this airline if you are traveling with kids. This is a no frills airline. Nothing special. There was no TV, period on our 5 hour flight from NY. All the kids in the plane were going nuts. The seats are very cramped and small. The plane seemed very old. \n\nGo Delta, if you have kids."
"2","This airline is definitely no-frills, as other reviewers have stated. No TV, attendants didn't smile, nickel-and-dime everything -- wot, no peanuts or pretzels or crackers? Not even one lil' bag? Are you kidding me? You have to buy their snack bag to get those. That used to be one of flying's great joys. A tiny bag of salty goodness. Not on this airline! \n\nWe've flown them before, but don't recall them EVER being this tight-assed. We've learned not to check luggage if we can at all help it because they charge $15 per bag. That's insane, but we know that's how they are, so we made do with carry-ons. Of course, that means the overhead bins fill up really fast and makes the cranky attendants even crankier. Whaddaya expect, lady, ordinarily most of this stuff would be checked! The employees seemed rather unhappy all-around. \n\nHowever, the flights themselves were basically decent. On time. It's worth it to us to put up with the lack of luxury when it's a really short flight and my Amex points are covering most of it. But for a longer flight, or if we have to come out of pocket more money, we'd look for a more comfortable airline."
"1","There's a reason we are told to be at the airport two hours in advance.  Had I left earlier, I wouldn't  have missed my flight at 7:30pm the Friday before labor day. \nThe US Air representative was kind enough to rebook me on the next flight out.  Unfortunately the next flight wasn't until 6 am the next morning.   Since it was Labor Day weekend; the check in line was long. I decided to grab a quick bite to eat then come back.   I returned less than 15 minutes later and gone were the customer service representatives,  and  self service check in counters had closed. \nI thought maybe they took a lunch break or something.  So I waited,  waited, and waited some more.  There were several other US Air passengers there also. I  also checked Us Air's , but no one was there either. \n I called the customer service line, and was transferred to US AIR's Hartsfield Jackson  number.  Frustrating doesn't even begin to describe how one feels when the customer service number rings the check in counter you're standing in front of.  Anyway I spoke with the same customer service 4 different times before she  told me US Air's reps would not return until 3:30am . \nThere is absolutely no excuse that I had to call customer service FOUR times before getting a straight answer.   Someone should have been able to assist me by my second call. That's not an unreasonable expectation, is it? \nAtlanta Hartsfield Jackson is nation's busiest airport. As such someone should be on call especially on holiday weekends where increased travel should be anticipated.  Delta and Air Tran both had customer service representatives on call."
"1","Dont ever Fly US Airways to Hawaii. The Flight Attendants were rude and very unpleasant. Spend the Extra and Fly Hawaiian Airline."
"1","I don't know where to begin with this review.  I guess it started when US Airways stranded us until 2:15 AM in Honolulu with a 3 year old and no offer of support or compensation due to a flight member needing some more sleep time.  You know, we could have all used some more sleep time.  Unfortunately, we had to pay for an extra night of hotel, but US Airways did not think they had to reimburse us, despite the delay not being due to weather and was on their end.\n\nSo, they gave us each $100 voucher codes for a future flight - so we could apparently get the same bad service again.  What I received was worse.  An attempt 2 months later to follow their instructions by calling Reservations and trying to book us on a vacation flight to Phoenix became an act in futility when the call got dropped at least 4 times using 2 separate phones.  The last attempt got me the closest of making the reservation, but then the so-called customer service rep told me they were having trouble with their system and to call back in 5-10 minutes.  Excuse me?  I'll say you're having trouble with your system.  Why don't you call ME back when it's fixed???\n\nThe next day, I started over from scratch.  I wanted to use the vouchers for my wife and daughter, but I wanted to fly with them using Dividend Miles.  After a pain-stakingly long time with Richard on the phone, we finally get them squared away, but then he tells me I will have to call back to the Dividend Miles extenstion to make my reservation.  What?  Not even a \""let me transfer you over to the Dividend Miles\"" folks???\n\nSo I play their game.  I call back and figure out which options to press to make a Dividend Miles reservation.  Guess who I get.  That's right, Richard.  \n\nHello again, hello.  \n\nWe go through another painstakingly long process of getting me booked, but at least he has my billing information so I don't have to repeat it.  We get almost to the end and I asked for our seating assignments to all be in row 19, seats D, E, and F for both flights.  Richard said \""no problem\"".  Later that day, when I go to check our reservations, the outbound flight to Phoenix has us in row 19 as I asked, but the return flight still has us in Row 14.  So, I had to go into the system and change our seat assignments (thank goodness I could do that on-line and not have to make another stressful call).\n\nHere is something even funnier: instead of two $100 vouchers if US Airways had given us the one night at the hotel, the cost would have been $215.  Yes, $15 more than what they ended up giving us.  $15 to keep a family of 3 satisfied instead of making us go through these painful processes and ticking us off and away from them forever.\n\nI sincerely doubt anyone from US Air cares what I think, how I was treated through this entire process, or will read this.  But for those of you who have a choice in who you choose as your airline carrier, DO NOT CHOOSE U.S. SCARE!   Friends don't let friends fly US Airways.  They are not worth yours or anyone else's business.  America West was at one time a pretty good airline.  I flew with them a fair amount.  US Air has managed to sink that company to an all-time low by bringing in their practices on how an airline should be run, which is to say, \""F-you, just give us your money.\"""
"3","I like US Airways because they simply fly where I go."
"1","Hopefully someone will put US Air out of its misery soon, as it has to be the worst airline (and I fly a lot - top FF level in United, Continental (both star alliance) and BA).  Traveling with family and they have a ton of seats available in coach but agent unwilling to change for a 4 year old and 7 year old..."
"1","Our us airways flight from Santa Barbara to Phoenix was on time, smooth, without delay and renewed my faith in the idea of flying versus driving, etc.   \n\nHowever, my return flight shook my faith in this mode of transportation. We arrived to check in at sky harbor only to be told that it was too late to check in.  Our flight was for 5:49pm. It was 5:10pm.  We were told by our eye-fluttering attendant typing at the keyboard with a fake smile that we needed to arrive at least 45 minutes prior to departure.  We lost are already paid for seats.  Resisting the urge to grab him by the neck and bang his head on the counter to see what would fall out, I politely asked for options which he responded with two: 1) wait until 9:00 pm to fly standby 2) or depart the next morning at 8:30am.  Not wanting to wait fora hours to see if we could board an oversold flight, we chose the latter option. \n\nWhen we arrived in the morning to a chaotic crowd of passengers, there was little direction by us airways employees.  Instead they only contributed to the chaos by giving vague directions.  They wouldn't last five minutes in my classroom.  Clearly some employee training is overdue here. \n\nWhen we finally checked ourselves in, we faced gates changes, delays due to maintenance, and an ever increasing amount if disgruntled travelers surrounding us.  I'm glad it's over.  No more US Airways."
"1","The Worse Airline Ever....God Forbid if they buy AA they will also screw that airline up forever also."
"1","Had the same issue with the 45 minute prior check-in.  I heard of such a thing being 30 minutes prior to check-in due to security reasons, we were at the 35 minute point so they definetely said no.  Their computers had already siezed up is what we were told, a security measure...federal rules to be exact.  Funny cuz Allegiant does no such thing.\n\nSo we were stuck in Reno for the night and got the next flight out, said my buddies bag was to large for the over head compartment, yet it was fine on the arrival.  So he had to pay.  The couple in front of us had a bag that weighted 51 pounds, 1 pound over and gave them grief.  The lady freaked out and started taking out shoes and clothes and shoving it in carry ons.  I don't blame her, 1 pound over really?  They don't know what customer satisfaction is, I'll stick with Southwest and Allegiant thanks !"
"1","Oh I forgot how much I hate you! \n\nYou've  yet again managed to ruin another family vacation! I promised myself the last time that I would never fly you again.  But somehow I forgot. \n\nDelayed due to a malfunctioning generator?? Really and now you want me to go 5 hours cross country on you with my offspring! I will never ever fly you again.\n\nMissing the AZ diamondback game was the least of my worries.  Thinking that I was flying on an old decrepit plane....yeah pretty much occupied my mind.\n\nYour staff is rude.  You didn't even offer us a FREE snack after delaying us for 3 hours.  \n\nYou made me want to write Jet Blue a love letter, asking for forgiveness because I cheated with a lesser quality airline.  I will never fly you again and OH I won't forget!!"
"2","I miss the days when flight attendants took pride in their appearance and were over the top nice.  The flight attendants for US Airways are run down and crabby.  There was an older Indian woman on my flight who did not speak English and they were very rude to her, it was hard to watch.  \n\nIt really chaps my hide that luggage is now $25 so I've made adjustments in my packing to fit everything I need into two carry-ons.  At least they make you aware of the fee though, what I did not know is that they now charge for meals on flights across the country.  For $8 I got the nastiest sandwich they could throw together.  They also make you recycle, which is really cool but I wanted to throw away my plastic drink cup, put my tray up and pass out but I had to wait 20 minutes because they weren't collecting plastic at that time.\n\nHere's a tip US Airways, when you treat your customers like crap, it puts them in a bad mood.  It's not a good idea to put people in a bad mood when they're cramped in  a small area, surrounded by strangers and can't get out of their seat for 5 hours."
"1","Flight attendant spilled water on my MacBook Pro\nFried it\nI work from home\nIt is my livelihood\nAirline won't pay for it \nCites \""we don't pay for electronics\"" \nI want my machine replaced\nNow"
"1","If there was a chance to give them 0 star I would after this email. They anticipate unreasonable and mean behavior.\nDear Dr. Ballan:\n\nThank you for contacting Customer Relations at US Airways. We welcome the opportunity to address your concerns regarding your recent departure from Phoenix.\n\nI'm sorry you were not able to check in for your flight. As you may already know, each airport has specific guidelines about check-in times to ensure customers and bags make it through security and to the aircraft on time. Once the check-in cutoff time has arrived, the computer system automatically restricts the ability to check any passenger in for the flight. Although I'm happy our agents were able to book you on the next flight with available seats, I realize this was a frustrating situation for you.\n\nFor Phoenix specifically, if you're checking bags at the ticket counter, you must check in at least 45 minutes before departure. Because the 45 minute requirement was not met, you were not able to be checked-in for flight 1550.\n\nThank you for giving us this opportunity to address your concerns. We realize you have a choice when flying and we thank you for choosing US Airways.\n\nSincerely,\n\n\nSara Berk\nRepresentative, Customer Relations\nUS Airways Corporate Office"
"1","An example of one of their stupid idiotic \""rules\"" is this. At the gate next to us, a flight for Al Paso was posted to leave at 6:50 but it was delayed for 1 hour. A couple left to get some food and arrived back in about 20 minutes ... but their plane had left. The rule is that even if we post a delay your flight might leave R Amy time without you .... So, if the airline is late they can fool you I to leaving and then take off without you WTH again?"
"2","Having done an adequate amount of traveling with different airlines, I would have to say US Airways is my least favorite. I just don't understand why they don't feed me? It was a six hour flight, an not even a snack? Madness. \nMore regarding the airlines though, Their stewards are not as cheerful or nice as others...and they mess up everything. Forget your flight leaving on time or having your baggage when you get there. They had three chances to get it right, and struck out every time. Rebooked me on another airlines' flight that was already overbooked and then wouldn't help us get on a new flight because they had \""turned us over\"", come on!"
"1","To Yelp readers - Avoid this airline. On a recent trip, I was denied full access to my seat (middle passenger encroached on half of my space, creating an intolerable experience and safety hazard. Not only did U S Airways not make alternative arrangements, but refused a prorated refund. They spent more in capital and staff expense \""defending\"" their indefensible position that the cost of the refund and created some poor advertisement as a result. A brief Facebook scan reveals many other complaints. I note several similar complaints on Yelp, also."
"1","A company that used to have great customer service and on-time flights that has deteriorated to unacceptable levels. I used to fly them almost exclusively but wondering if your plane is going to arrive with each trip forced me to switch. And anytime you had to talk to someone good luck...they always seemed annoyed when dealing with customers. That was 2 years ago. \n\nAdvance to 2014 and I have some miles left that if I don't use I forfeit. So I decided to take a trip to Vegas. The flight out was only a few minutes late - not bad. The return flight? Well I'm still waiting to get home and I'm on standby for the next 2 flights - both of which are oversold. Tried to work with an agent to see that my options were and rudeness and lack of empathy don't begin to describe her behavior. Never even an apology - no service recovery attempt at all. I've written to their customer service department and will update this review when/if I get a response. \n\nSo this will be the absolute last time I use this airline and gladly so. Even a \""free\"" trip using miles isn't worth the way I've been treated today. \n\nUse a competitor - you'll be better off. Good luck out there."
"1","Here is a recipe for success:  take the two worst airlines in the industry and merge them together.  What do you think you get?  One colossal airline that completely sucks"
"1","My family and I were flying from Austin, TX to Phoenix (final destination was Anchorage, AK) on June 28th. We had our 12 year old daughter, who suffers from a brain malformation schizencephaly, with us. She requires a wheelchair to get around in and we gate checked it in Austin. There were two tags placed on the chair. One was for the gate check itself, the other was the full itinerary. When we arrived in Phoenix, my husband saw the ground crew take our daughters wheelchair and place it in a vehicle. Well, when you gate check something, you get it when you get to the next city. Not so much with US Air!! Now, they decided that the wheelchair was going to go directly to our next gate. We had a 4 hour layover in PHX. 4 hours of carrying my 12 year old, 66 pound daughter around. Yeah, I don't think so. So when I asked our flight attendant she quickly jumped at 'we can't speak with the ground crew\"" then proceeded to get herself ready to deplane. We took all of our stuff, including our other 2 daughters and my 12 year olds car seat, up to first class where we waited for the ground crew to bring my daughters wheelchair up. 10 minutes later, we were asked to deplane so they could get the plane ready for the next batch of passengers. We waited for about another 10-15 minutes in the terminal waiting for them to bring me her chair. When we finally got the chair, the lady was very rude saying \""Here's your chair\"" then walking off. I will never fly US Air with my daughter again. This was completely unprofessional and unbelievably rude."
"3","So I'm here every other week seems like, and I haven't had any problem with US airways.."
"1","A completely avoidable 3 HOUR tarmac delay in a frozen cabin!  NEVER flying US airways again.\n\nMy connecting flight from PHX to OAK came to the gate with a known major technical issue in the cockpit which would prevent proper pre-flight checks.\n\nThey boarded us anyway rather than provide a different plane. As one of the first people on board I saw 3 maintenance staff already present on the aircraft.\n\nWe received no status and upon inquiry (after 45 minutes with no action), they \""claimed\"" it was the first officer's seat-belt that needed replacement.   Seat belts don't take 3 hours to replace, nor do they require 4 levels of maintenance staff.  They had us sit there in a plane cold enough to ship freshly packed meat for 3 freaking hours.\n\nBy the time we took off I had developed a 103 fever.  I should sue them on behalf of my company, as I'll probably be down for the rest of the week trying to recover.\n\nThey also violated FAA/DOT rules regarding provision of adequate food/hydration, and after something so egregious, they offered nothing in compensation."
"1","Worst flight experience ever.  Traveling with three small children and closed the door on us for our connecting flight because they had re routed us without telling us assuming we were not making our connecting flight which we ran to and arrived at in time.  Customer service may as well close up since they are just faces who can't do anything but admit we were right but they are powerless. Same with 1-800 #.  Don't waste your money flying this airline."
"1","This is the worst experience I have ever had with an airline. I had 3 flights delays for 2 hours or more!!! I miss some very important business, which cause me to miss hundreds of dollars and personal event dealing with my family. I'm going write more complaints on yelp and anywhere so other future clients don't make a mistake to purchase a flights with US Airways!!!!\n\nIt's 8pm 12/6/14 and now my flight has  been cancelled\nI been at the airport since 4pm"
"1","There is a reason the flights are so cheap...they charge you 100 dollars if your bag is over 50 pounds but they'll give you a trash bag to put your items in to check and then you don't have to pay. Oh, I guess that extra five pounds really doesn't make a difference then does it. Why would I put my belongings in garbage bag to get tossed around? I even to them I was military on leave orders and it didn't seem to matter. Awful airlines... I'll pay extra to fly with Alaska."
"4","If you haven't been to the Indoor Swap Mart, it can be difficult to describe.  Imagine these ingrediants all marinating in one giant shopping stew - Small business, garage sale, infomercials, Avon, amazing deals, tacky statues, street fair, carnival, and dollar store.  That is one freaky stew.   \n\nI had never gone until a few years ago.  It was a bit overwhelming.  But once your're in there, we found some amazing places.  There is a guy there who's been fixing watches for like 30 years and just couldn't afford to have a full time shop, so he does this.  He fixed a problem we'd been having that a fancy watch shop said couldn't be fixed.  Then there is my favorite - the sunglass guy.  He'll look at you, look at your face and say, \""You know what, I think these would look great on you\"" and hand you a pair of glasses that you might not have pictured wearing, but they look great on you. And they are pretty cheap.  You have to realize that every little bench or table is someone with a business.  Sometimes that business includes some wacky and weird items.  But that can be fun to just laugh at too.  \n\nIt can be quite an adventure or just a great day of shopping based on your interests.  But it will definately never be dull."
"2","Went here for lunch on a not-super-busy Thursday. After an exchange with the very confused waitress about nutmeg (my friend has allergies), I ordered an egg salad sandwich. When I got it, there was literally only a tablespoon of egg salad on the bread. It was mostly a lettuce sandwich. I would've said something to the waitress, but she had given us our check with our food and never came back to see how we were doing. Poor service, poor food."
"1","I didn't like this place at all. I came with 3 friends and non of us like there omelets. There were very dry tasting..."
"2","Dear Hyatt--\n\nIt's time . Phoenix is becoming , or at least trying to become a big city and you need to seriously consider some upgrades. You are looking dated and tired. I suggest getting inspired and moving into the now. \n\nHere are a few suggestions :\n\nGo up to the eighth floor look out onto the atrium look at the tile and carpet It's hodge podge  , stained and worn out. Ick! \n\nRemodel to  a  contemporary look that embraces the southwest feel. \n\nDo something bout the curtains in the suites they look  faded and have strings hanging from the hardware.\n\nScrape off the popcorn ceilings and clean the other ceilings , I can see dust hanging in places. \n\nShow off your elevators with flair and panache. \n\nLove and Kisses ,\nme"
"1","Buzzzzzzz in my room all night long coming from the vents. Creepy clicking speaker in the ceiling. Construction noises like a drill sting during the day. I can hear my neighbors talk. Avoid at all cost."
"4","Spent a weekend in PHX for the Dbacks vs. Giants and booked the Hyatt based on the proximity of the hotel.  I was suprised by the accomodations.  VERY NICE!  Rooms are average sized and have great blackout curtains.  Pool was small but nice.  Felt good after walking back in the HOT sun.\n\nBest part about the experience was despite arriving when most people are checking out, they found a room early so we could dump our luggage and head out to the ballpark.\n\nThe restaurant/bar in the hotel was great in the evening.  Super Bartender Ryan and Awesome bar manager Danielle make that place fun!  They know how to cater to different clientele.  oh!  and the food and beer selection is good too!"
"4","I travel for work (entertainment) very often... Location is great to catch a sports game as the Diamondbacks stadium is across the street, the Suns basketball arena is across the street as well, not to forget the convention center is only steps away. Valet and bell hops were very attentive and kept the flow of traffic moving. Front desk was knowledgable about the surrounding area and always acknowledging people with a smile. Housekeeping was nice about privacy and not nagging about trying to clean your room like other hotels, but they were on your floor through the morning if you needed any items. Although I didn't use the pool and spa, it looked super clean... The fitness center was fully stocked and clean with ample space and equipment to get a good workout in. The security guard on site was very friendly and helpful. Elevators were fast and abundant. Last but not least, the rooms were of normal Hyatt quality. Clean and a typical hotel standards. Honestly I felt like I was at home here just without a kitchen. I would definitely stay here again! \nTip: if you're a member of the Hyatt's rewards, you can get a day or two of free Internet access...\nTip2: there's an Enterprise at this location if a car is needed..."
"3","I was impressed by the lobby as it looked more modern and chic than what I think of for a Hyatt, but once I entered the room, it was a let down. Awkward layout, small TV and popcorn ceilings, BUT the bed was very comfortable. The toiletries also included toothpaste and makeup wipes which were nice additions.\n\nValet parking is $28/night or $19/night for self, however the Chase garage next door has 24 hour parking for $14.\n\nThere's an Einsteins in the lobby which is nice for breakfast, but the only other food option is their revolving Compass Room restaurant. \n\nThe gym was nice and spacious, with a large selection of machines. For a hotel, they had a better than average gym.\n\nOverall, this hotel is not a bad choice for the area, but I would never pay full price for it. I also didn't like that they're not pet friendly. We got a great deal through Priceline, otherwise for comparable price I prefer the Kimpton Palomar."
"2","2/5 standard chinese.\n\ni'll start off by saying it was my fault for getting chinese in phoenix. but a senior in my office was heading there, so of course i had to go. the food is standard chinese/cornstarch fare, though i'm sure there is a saving chef's specialty dish."
"2","This place stays alive becase there are hungry jurors trapped in the basement of the grand jury room who need food.  The carpet hasn't been cleaned since probably the Nixon era.  And the food is pretty standard.  That said, everyone has to go there at least once so that they say they have a) survived it b) been there c) surprisingly crave it.  Most people pick a, but some surprisingly pick c.  It's an old-school Phoenix thing and you have to support that!"
"3","It's been a long time since I've eaten at Sing High.  Our lunch dining experience was a good one.  We'd go back.  Get in a little early for lunch or you may be waiting for a table and service will take longer.     \n\nThe restaurant web page states that for over 80 years Sing High has run on hard work and good food.  I agree.  The menu's built around the basics of fried and tossed noodles - chow and lo mein,  chop suey, and egg foo yung.  There's more served than that, but those items head the menu.  \n\nI'll add that the Sing High premises are extremely clean and the service is timely.  \n\nWe had a lunch special with soup, egg roll, sweet and sour pork, moo goo gai pan fried rice plus a serving of beef chow mein.  As the web page also states, most items are prepared fresh.  My hot and sour soup was different than some hot/sour soups I've tasted, a little thicker, SIng High's personal recipe.  More a small burrito than an egg or spring roll, the egg roll was delivered too steaming hot to eat immediately.  The pork was also freshly prepared, my thinking back, my count is 9 unusually large pieces.  The fried rice was white rice cooked well, fired with soy sauce and a bit of veggies.  The plate of noodles was large and flavors good.  \n\nWe took home half our lunch and had a very good dinner later.     \n\nIf you've got jury duty, business down town, or paying a visit to Copper Square, this is a reasonably price spot to consider for a Chinese-American meal."
"3","This place used to have really good food. Now you get more than half of your plate covered in bean sprouts. I think its over priced for what you get.\n\nI've always had good service here."
"3","When I want a fast food burger, the Jack Sirloin burger is my go-to. Chez Jack hits the spot en route to or from a night of revelry. This Jack was fast and friendly, can't ask for more."
"2","I remember when I used to sit with proprietor David L. at Biltmore C.P. (not CPK, you freak) and listen to him get passionate about this modular bakery concept thing where he could use the best ingredients and still make it inexpensively. Willo Bread was born.\n\nI also remember when I was little going to My Florist for FLOWERS. Over the years, the strip mall saw many tenants come and go and seemingly at just the right moment, David picked up one of the suites and began his bakery project. After its extreme success with local AJ's and \""fine\"" restaurants around town, he expanded to the old flower shop (converting it to a restaurant), its loft overhead and the adjoining suite for the grocery.\n\nPerhaps it was my third visit that was the one I shan't forget. I am a pianist and have played professionally here and there over the years. After hearing just one selection by SAVANT [Nicole?] I was so discouraged I resolved never to play again. I hate her (not really) for being so good. Try going up to talk to her and you'll see what I mean. She's clearly multi-tasking on 7 or 8 different threads, one of which is to talk with you. I've seen her on the phone while playing with one hand, reaching out to the nearby table while playing with one hand, totally looking the opposite direction for minutes at a time, and more. Total Savant.\n\nShe easily has the entire repertory of all music in her head, but for her it is not the music itself, but the concepts of the music from which she plays. She can play the entire soundtrack from Nintendo's Super Mario Bros. It's uncanny. Ask her to play a classical piece, and only because you know the exact note order, phrases and timings do you realize that she's pretty close, but not exact. Who cares? She could play against Mozart in dueling pianos and he'd end up on the floor gasping in and out of a paper bag.\n\nAt some point David bought her a concert Steinway, well deserved.\n\nOther than the place where [name?] played during her lifetime, My Florist will have no other mark on the history of Phoenix. To those of us still alive wishing we could add our own marks on history, our screaming and YELLING about the poor service, useless bartenders and ridiculous menu will be but whispers against her virtuosity. But let me make my attempt.\n\nSeeing my favorite bottle of gin on the shelf, I ordered my martini: \""Sapphire martini, straight up, stirred (!!!) with a twist\"". What came back was a brown thing that looked like chocolate milk. \""Oh, I thought you ordered an espresso martini.\"" Tell me, does Sapphire sound like \""espresso\"" to you? My answer is... only to someone who has NO CLUE about what a real martini is. Do me a favor and don't insult the reputation of Bombay Sapphire: please instead display and serve Gordon's.\n\nAfter a recent performance of the Arizona Broadway Theater, we joined the cast as they gathered for a late dinner and drinks. After the 25 of us ate and drank, we spent the next 55 minutes (no joke) figuring out the bill because they couldn't split the check, not even in half. forGET it! (don't you forget CASH -- in small denominations -- if you're going with a group).\n\nIf from the limited menu you think you can picture the four tubs of ingredients and sauces in the kitchen, mixed in all the possible 10 ways on the menu, it's because you can: the Dole European Lettuces variety salad mix is the same on every single plate, the same olives and olive oil or orange and apple wedges garnish every dish, and the same bread (yes, it can be good if you buy it first thing in the morning), is sliced and toasted to make you think it isn't as old and hard as it actually is.\n\nNot to say that the bread isn't good. Just know that when bread is made this way (without all the nasty chemicals and preservatives), and then is exposed to AIR, it gets hard. Eat it within a few hours of being baked. My advice is to go to the grocery first thing when it opens and try to get one of the 4 willowich sandwiches available daily (scrumptious ham, cheese, basil and add vinaigrette) before they go. You'll have to beat me, so get up early."
"1","Okay, I am not sure what has possessed me to return to this place after my first experience there.  The only thing that I can think of is that the passage of time dulled my senses and made me forget about my prior experiences, but I have written myself a note reminding myself to avoid this place in the future. \n\nThis restaurant has survived on the hype of being one of the only \""nice\"" places downtown, but luckily that has changed.  I went there for dinner one night and because I did not feel like ordering a $20 salad, I decided to order a $15 sandwich.  THe only thing that I can think of is that upon hearing my order the \""chef\"" immediately ran down to the nearest vending machine and got a roast beef sandwich out of that vending machine, took the sandwich out of the plastic wrap and plopped it down on the plate and actually had the gonads to serve it as if they made it!  It was by far the worst meal I have had in some time and is a constant reminder why I will not eat there again, unless my Alzheimers kicks in.  \n\nIf you have to go there my recommendation is that you eat before hand and simply order a martini.\n\nikk8ide 2ccccccc."
"1","The jazz pianist is fantastic.\n\nOtherwise the food sucks & the place just creeps me out.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: Great piano music does not make a great restaurant"
"4","Come here for brunch or early lunch otherwise you will be singing the same woes of all the other 1-3 star Yelpers.\nI mean how can you really hate a place that had 1/2 price bottles of wine, i mean i guess you could if you were one of those \""McCain-loving-obama is a socialist-there is no parking for my H2\"" type people but i personally appreciate cheap stuff. \nThe best way to do my florist is as follows...\nRoll out of bed on a Sunday, it's 10am, your head is pounding and you cant think straight. Stumble to the bathroom, clean up, cover up last night's hair with a hat, don some big sunglasses, pick up friends and head to Florist. Order a mimosa, drink it, and order a bloody marry. (best around) Okay, you are starting to feel human again, execute stage two; biscuits and gravy OR if last night was particularly rough stick with eggs on toast. Continue with afore mentioned drinks and mastication until all is right in the world. \n\nLook this is not an amazing restaurant but it is GOOD. They always have discounted drink specials or cheap wine, the food is consistent and service is the best if you sit at the bar. \nFor dinner make sure to get the breads with herbed butter and the cheese plate. Sandwiches are no Pane Bianco but they are all pretty solid with the Turkey and Brie being my standby. \n\nI am sorry but what is wrong with the piano lady covering current hits with a jazz inflection, if you want Brahm's 9th Symphony go somewhere other than a trendy cafe, Jesus. It is klitchy and gets her tips, calm down fancy pants, it is however true it can get loud in the seats right by her.\n\nOh... the bathroom is completely private and shwankily candle lit... so ah... yea. Watch how much you drink and who may or may not be pulling you into said den of inequity for covert lip-locking"
"3","My date and I hit the Willo District Home Tour today and decided to grab lunch here since I had never been, I had always wanted to go, it was a gorgeous day out and within walking distance.\n\nWe get up to the host stand and some woman dashes in front of us telling the waiter who was present that she called ahead to say she was on her way. The waiter looked for her in the book, didnt find her...I know this because I looked too and he politely referred her to the host. Mr Rico Suave in the sweater vest does a once over on the book and instead of letting the lady know there are 2 parties ahead of her, seats her right away. Okay douche? Not only that ,one of the servers passes him and says \""you know you just sat me 4x in a row?\"" We say nothing. the host returns, looks past me and my date and the 3 person party behind us.passes us all by and beckons the party after them? Um hello dickweed, do you not see the 5 people standing here in front of you patiently waiting. My date stepped up and said something and someone graciously swept in and said he would seat us. We were seated but to be honest I was stewing for the mere fact the host was so incredibly incompetent. Anyway we sat we ordered and they brought us someone else's food. UGH. When they finally bring us the correct food, we have no silverware..Seriously? Can anything be done correctly? I had the cafe panini and it said salami but it wasn't thinly cut Genoa salami as one would expect it was thick almost like ham..Not what I expected but decent nonetheless.\n\nThe place was busy but not running around like a chicken with its'  head cut off busy which is what the staff made it appear to be. They just seemed beyond unorganized, absolutely no structure.\n\nI would return and try something else but I wouldnt suggest this place if you're in a rush or expect too much in the way of service. If anything great for a 1st date because if you have a lull in conversation you can bond over the surprisingly bad service.\n\n\n**** In response to your slanderous \""compliment\""Jon \""Lazarus Pennypants E\""  let me clarify. No I am not a self entitled brat. I may have been called many things in my life but nothing ever close to that. However, you described the host to a \""T\"". Come to think of it, he's the worst host I have ever come across, he didnt \""greet\"" any guests that walked in the door, he didnt speak a word to them, as he sat them nor apologize when he blatantly overlooked people that were patiently waiting. He just carried on with a silent  pompous air about him. I apologize if douchebag didnt sum that up. As for your second question.YES I worked in the restaurant industry for  6 years and I have never in those years or any of my dining experiences ever encountered the unorganized chaos that this restaurant displayed. Also, by the looks of the other reviews..Im not alone. Ps. who exactly do you think you are to slander other Yelpers reviews. You didnt even disagree with my review, you just backhanded me??? What's funny is Ive seen that exact same email posted to other Yelpers. Yes that's exactly what Yelp needs..your drama.Bravo!****"
"3","Had lunch here yesterday with my husbands mom and sister. we started with bloody Mary's and they were super yummy I would come back for those alone. ordered the bruchetta for starters and it was OK, a little steep in price $12 for 4 pieces, they are big slices of bread but big being WAY to thick, we chose 4 different kinds and I liked one and the other two were ehhh. we all ordered different items so we could share and taste. I got the brie salad and it was pretty good the raspberry dressing made it, every now and then I ate a piece of lettuce that tasted like dirt but all in all it was good. sister in law got the Ruben and man was that pastrami thick, I think the slicing made it tuff and chewy. mom in law got the soup sandwich combo , mushroom brie soup was super yummy but her chicken cordon blue was nasty the chicken had that weird been reheated in the microwave taste yuck I ate one bite and that was it. service was good,  place was super cute, prices were a little steep for what you get.   It was a 30 min drive for me so not sure if I will go back."
"2","Sorry, Crazy Jim.  While your place is a popular lunch spot with downtown workers, the food is average Greek fare, at best. Had a Chicken Patra Pita. Average pita, stuffed with average chicken, grilled onions, peppers and cheese, accompanied by an undistinguished pile o' lettuce. Next time I'll try somewhere else."
"1","I work across from this place. I ordered a \""lunch Greek salad\"" that was advertised for $5.90, with FREE DELIVERY. When they delivered it, the price was $11.80!! Salad was $8.49 with $2.50 delivery. They had to WALK across the street...really?\n\nI called to question the price. She was very rude.\n\n I recommend this restaurant, to the patrons from our theater, all the time.  NEVER AGAIN!!  After seeing other reviews, I'm not surprised!! \n\nGo down to Cityscape. It's worth the 2 block walk!"
"5","Super yummy! Great location! Very filling!\n\nWent here to grab a sammie before a meeting at City Hall. I got the Italian with provolone on wheat bread. Well, I ordered it on wheat but got French bread. BUT they gave me a cookie to say sorry for the mix-up... HOW NICE IS THAT!? I didn't care what bread I got, my waistline may care but who listens to their waistline these days, I just wanted to sandwich. And it was great!\n\nA tad spicey for me but I also choose the Italian seasoning too so I was asking for it. The cookies were so moist and soft, fell apart in my hand like delicious sand-heaven. The interior of this joint is so city-scape and metro. Super high ceiling, old bar like ordering station, booths that face out onto the street... everything was great!\n\nHad a bit of trouble understanding the guy making my lunch but if he was kind enough to give me a cookie for messing up my bread, he can talk as fast as he wants because I'll be back for sure. I went around 1:30pm and it was bumping so I'm assuming it's packed at peak lunch hour time, well worth the wait though."
"4","We've been twice in the past couple years and enjoyed both performances (Simon Boccanegra and Madame Butterfly) immensely. Unfortunately, by the time we fly in and find a hotel (even at Jerry's) we only feel like we can afford the cheap seats. The chairs are a little narrow up there in opera glass country. Might have to open the wallet a little next time. Check if there is a pre-show lecture - worth the time and you might get closer parking in the garage. Parking is a good deal for AZ."
"5","I love this place.  I especially love it on Tuesdays when it's free. \n\nI have been to many lectures, openings and films at the Museum and am always fascinated.  \n\nThe changing photography exhibit is always fantastic.  The fashion room is one of my favorite features.  BUT my favorite piece is the firefly installation.  I could seriously live in that room. I take everyone I know and everyone is always as mesmerized as I am, and I have seen it many times.\n\nI love the new contemporary wing of the museum.  I also love the glass boxes on the sides of the building.  One time we were there during a thunderstorm and sat in the glass box and watched the lightening.  It was perfect!  \n\nThe museum always makes me happy."
"4","I still have to take away a star because it's just still so confusing. There was no entrance-fee wackiness this time, but I was still completely lost. Don't get me wrong, I love this museum. It's amazing. It's the perfect place to go if you -want- to get lost and wander for hours. But if you're going for something specific, sometimes it can be a little tricky to get to it.\n\nI went to see Making Waves (contemporary Japanese prints) specifically. I wasn't sure what gallery they were in, so we just started out by wandering around. Found some amazing contemporary Chinese paintings. After more wandering, we still hadn't found Making Waves, so we ended up asking a series of PAM employees/volunteers.\n\n1st employee: \""Oh, that exhibit is right in this gallery *points at map*\"" \nWe go there... and it's the Chinese paintings. Not Japanese prints.\n\n2nd employee: \""I'm pretty sure it's in this gallery, here *points at another gallery on map*\""\nNada.\n\n3rd employee: \""I'm not sure, maybe it's this way?\""\nNope.\n\n4th employee: \""Wait... do you mean you want the Firefly exhibit?\""\n.....no. \n\nFinally, someone got us to Making Waves, which was in one of the few nooks we hadn't already wandered into by accident. Talk about painful. \n\nAnyway, Making Waves was great. We also checked out the previously mentioned Firefly exhibit, which is a permanent (yes!!!) installation called \""You Who Are Getting Obliterated in the Dancing Swarm of Fireflies.\"" It's amazing, disorienting, and totally trippy. Check it out."
"5","This is one of my favorite places in the valley - there's always something new here, and it's big enough that I don't often get to walk the entire thing in one visit. \n\nIf you visit often, I recommend a membership. $75 gets you in for free, but the $200 level gets you invited to all 4 private exhibition event evenings.  The $100 level gets you invited to two. \n\nThey host frequent lectures and all kinds of interesting events. You can always find something  going on, on their calendar.\n\nSome of the permanent collection I am very fond of... Seeing the same exhibitions a bunch of times is kind of like visiting an old friend. There is always something new to appreciate. The rotating and visiting exhibits are always well presented, as well. \n\nArcadia Farms is a fantastic place to eat, the healthy slow food really fits. I mean, what do they serve at the Met in NY? They have a shitty cafeteria. We have Arcadia Farm bitches! OK so the Met has a huge Egyptian temple and Dutch masters paintings, but we have this weird reflective black plastic concave/convex thing and a dark room full of hanging LED's and mirrors. \n\nThere is more culture in Phoenix than the out of date yogurt in your fridge!"
"5","Very impressed, first time there and they had some extraordinary Art especially the Dancing Swarm of Fireflies by Yayoi Kusama ... that was worth the price of entry alone.\nNice to have Arcadia Farms there too."
"4","I purchased a membership to the Phoenix Art Museum last year and I am very glad that I did.  Coming to the museum gives me a chance to relax and feed my soul with art on a regular basis.  The membership entitles you to bring another adult along so that is also a plus since it has given me a chance to introduce the museum to other friends and family members for free.\n\nJust in the year or so that I have been going it seems like this place is continually improving itself.  I have to admit that when I first moved to Phoenix I was disappointed at the museums here and I still feel like we are not up to par with other cities of the same size.  It is nice to see one art/culture venue that is striving to be better.  I have not been able to partake in all the events that they hold (tours, lectures, movie screenings, etc) since they mostly seem to fall on weeknights.  But I still have managed to see all the rotating exhibits (my favorite was the one on Cezanne and his contemporaries) while they are there.  It is great to have an excuse to get out of the 'burbs on the weekend and come enjoy downtown... or I guess its uptown... or midtown?  Anyway, I think they're doing a great job and this is a real Phoenix gem."
"5","I love this museum. The architecture is gorgeous. They have great collections. My girlfriend and I went to see the Modern Mexican exhibit last Wednesday when admission was free. We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. It was my third visit to PAM and I always leave feeling energized and inspired. I highly recommend it."
"1","I am an art lover but don't dig the overkill by the people who are \""guarding\"" the art from the common folk.  After having a run-in with an over-zealous guard and then discussing it with Heather the manager, I will most likely not return.  They are many friendlier art installations in the valley...I will give them my hard-earned support instead."
"5","My happy place, and one of the best parts of Phoenix. I have an annual membership because I come here so frequently. PAM gets big draws for national exhibits and has some remarkable names in possession. We truly have a world class art museum, here, folks!!!  Go. You'll be happier than Pharrell in the moments before he lost the Oscar. Go! Go!"
"4","Sometimes I crave a baked potato. Don't need anything fancy, don't need all the fix'ns, no bacon, no chili, not even sour cream. Just a little cheese, chives, and pepper. Maybe some salsa. And I love every bite - the skin is my favorite! \n\nAs simple as that sounds, it is not always easy to find on a menu, especially in the downtown Phoenix lunch arena. Luckily, I have the Court House Cafe within walking distance when the craving arises. \n\nI have been to the cafe several times to eat lunch there or get takeout. Nothing fancy, just a casual sit down place, with good, traditional American cafe/diner food with very friendly service. Sandwiches, wraps, salads, soups, even meatloaf! Located on the third floor, around the corner from the elevators.\n\nMost of my experience is with the catering. At work, we have been using the CHC to cater our group events for years. They do breakfast and lunch, have a great variety of options, are reasonably priced, have a friendly and efficient staff, and they deliver! \n\nSo friendly and efficient. They bring everything you need: plates, napkins, utensils, serving spoons, tongs, etc. And come back to pick it all up when we are done. \n\nAnd the cookies for dessert are huge! They are as big as the small plate they give you to put it on. Sometimes that's a good thing, sometimes it's not (depending on your eating habits). \n\nBreakfast catering options range from bagels and pastries, to fresh fruit, to breakfast burritos (split into halves, wrapped in foil, labeled with the type of burrito and the ingredients). \n\nFor lunch catering options they have various wraps (packaged same as burritos), fresh salads (with good, green, romaine), a few pasta options, and much, much more. The veggie wrap with some of their raspberry vinaigrette on the side is one of my favorites. \n\nOverall, good food and great service. I recommend checking out the CHC when you're looking for a change of pace from the typical downtown lunch scene, looking to cater a group event, or when you just want a baked potato."
"3","I have been to 2 Cultural festivals here. It is a great venue for showcasing food and cultural performances. \nParking can be steep at the garages nearby if you cannot find it for free on the street."
"3","Got a great deal on hotwire, for three days, around $20 a day.  You have to take a shuttle from the airport to the car rental.  You walk to the second island outside of baggage claim, the buses run quite frequently, were there 3 lined up to pick people up when I arrived at 11:30am on a Friday.  The ride only took 5-10 minutes.  \nThe rental facility is huge and nicely air conditioned.  When I walked up to the Hertz rental, there must have been 30 people ahead of me, around 5 sales people and took around 45 minutes before I was helped.  In fact, I was pulled from the line to follow an attendent downstairs, where there were 3 sales people to help ring us up.  \nGot upgraded to a compact with a GPS since they ran out of subcompact.  Loved the GPS during the stay, I want one  at home now.   The car is a little dirtier then other rental places, the carpets had stains and the outside had some marks on the paint but I still would take the GPS over those aesthetics.\nFinding the car was easy, in numerical order and all was covered.  When I dropped off the car, was easy, you just need to remember which bus to take you to which terminal, I believe there are 4 seperate terminals."
"1","I rented a mini van for ten days. We realized after two days the door didn't lock. A few days later we got a flat tire. Hertz said I could put on the spare and drive 80 mles to the ElPaso airport or stay in the town overnight and get a van at the local branch. We decided to stay the night in a hotel. In the morning the local Hertz had NO vehicles so I had to drive To ElPaso ( over two hr round trip). When i returned the vehicle and talked to the manager she just gave me a blank stare and told me that she is not required to compensate me because i booked through Priceline. Oh well I still saved 50%."
"1","Whatever you do, AVOID HERTZ AT ALL COST AT THIS AIRPORT.\nSince, 2011, I've probably flown into Phoenix 3 or 4 times.  Each and every time I had a reservation and my name wasn't on the Gold marquee when I arrived.  After waiting in line at the GOLD booth, I then had to WAIT for a car.  This rarely happens in any other city.  And, If this is the way they treat a preferred GOLD member, I can only imagine how other non-status customers are treated.  If this were an isolated incident in Phoenix, I could understand.  But, 3 or 4 times in a row is just simply poor management and incompetentence ... and they are not at all apologetic.  Just last week, I almost missed an hour of the meeting because I was waiting 45 minutes for a car.  Ridiculous.\n\nHere's the best part ... they sent me a survey and I have them horrible rankings.  The lowest score on the \""recommend\"" scale.  Do you think anyone bothered to contact me?  NOPE.  :)   Then, a week later, they had the nerve to send me an e-mail asking if I would like to post my comments on various social media sites.  Now that's some really incompetent target marketing if I've ever seen any.  \n\nEven though this is who I my company negotates rates with and is our preferred rental car providor, I'll have to choose a different providor at this airport."
"1","2nd time in a row that they have overbooked and now I am waiting for a car. Why bother making reservations when they don't have enough cars! I was supposed to pick up my car at 11:15 am and it is 12:30, and they say it will be ready in another 30 mins. Whoever the operations manager is should seriously consider other career paths, because clearly this is not an area of strengh!"
"1","We arrived to pick up our vehicle having a reservation.  Despite the line not being particularly long they took forever.  Everything they tried to sell to my husband he declined.  Despite that we turned in the car being charged $337.77 for 3 days for a Camry despite having a quote of $142.08 for a Corolla.  One of our charges was for an upgrade which they say my husband agreed to although he never did.  Another thing they did was charge us for fuel.  They told my husband it was cheaper to have them fill up the vehicle when he returned the car.  That may have been true if the vehicle was returned empty.  They charge you for a full tank of gas despite what you use.  They failed to mention that.  I'm sure it was it the small print somewhere so our mistake but consider it a warning.  They left out the important fact which is deceiving.  We returned a car with 3/4 of a full tank and were charged $54.72 for fuel.  I will not use Hertz again."
"1","Worst car rental and customer service  experience of my LIFE. \n\nWhen I rent a car a few weeks in advance of my trip, it better be there. My experience began with a 30 min wait in line (at 10pm on a Wednesday). There were only 2 or 3 reps yet a long line of customers. Meanwhile other rental car lines were moving along relatively speedily. But this wasn't what irritated me. \n\nNo, the reason I'm leaving a review is partially to pass the HOUR+ I've been waiting to receive the car that should have been ready for me at my designated pick-up time. I would understand if I was a walk-up customer and there weren't cars available. But how are there not cars available when my reservation was in the system (along with the dozens of irritated customers). This is absurd.  \n\nThe worst part is how flippant the rep was about it - no attempts to remedy the situation, no apologies even. We were also given a 45 min wait time but were told it would likely be much \""sooner.\"" Well it's been 1:15 and still no car.\n\nTo add insult to injury, we noticed that other people who had come after us had gotten their cars and then were given the advice by a fellow sufferer to talk to a rep because they weren't coming out to the waiting area and calling our name as they had promised. She had gotten bypassed and had we not talked to the rep, we would have too. \n\nI will NEVER give business to Hertz again and will be sure to spread the word, starting with this review. If I could, I would rate Hertz  negative 4 stars instead of 1."
"1","Absolutely horrible. Spent $1000 to rent a 2014 Jaguar XJL for 2 days. Brought it back on time and full of gas. 3 days later I'm getting over $1200 worth of charges on my card from Hertz. Then a day later an automated \""urgent\"" phone call saying I never returned the car. Seriously?!? It takes 4 days for them to realize an $85,000.00 luxury car wasn't returned??? Considering it was already returned, I don't know what's worse. The fact that is was and they had no clue or the fact that it took a machine 4 days to call me asking about it. After multiple attempts to reach the people at the actual Hertz desk at the airport without going through the 800 number and talking to someone in Michigan. I finally had to take time out of my day to drive back down to the airport only to wait in line and then speak to a manager. Never in my life have I met a more lazy, incompetent, unapologetic manger (Veronica). When I walked up she was sitting down in her chair at the desk(no other employee was sitting even though they all had chairs at their computers) I explain the situation and she proceeds to make 4 different phone calls trying to locate the \""unreturned\"" car. After she finds it she informs me it was put to the side so parts could be ordered for it. She asks the person on the other line if she needs to charge me for the parts? Yes apparently I stole the cupholder out of the jag which they valued at $80. Yea ya know they're right that jaguar cup holder just looks and fits so good in my Mercedes. (If you didn't pick up on it that was sarcasm)\n\nAfter much argument she told me I chose coverage for the car when I rented it so I'm not responsible for the cupholder. After wasting quite enough time I asked for a printed invoice of my final bill. She then says she doesn't have a printer. Really you don't have a printer? There is literally over 20 computers at the hertz desk. \""I don't have a printer but she does\"" pointing to an employee next to us helping other people. Bottom line is she was to lazy to stand up and move to one of the other 18 open computers and print my receipt. She told another guy to walk over and do it. Bottom line she was incredibly rude, lazy, disrespectful and made no attempt to offer an apology for the huge mistake and waste of time on my part. After asking at the very end \""so no apology what so ever? She offered a measly \""sorry\"" \n\nVeronica please do us all a favor and resign or learn some basic manners, take a little more initiative and learn to offer an apology when you know your company is in the wrong."
"1","This is my first review. I recently rented through Hertz using AAA. With using AAA, you pay a good portion of your rental up front. I reserved a standard car and was left with an \""estimated\"" balance of $80. This total price was inline with most of the other major rental agencies, including tax, as far as price was concerned. When I signed my agreement the total balance was $166 not $80. When I asked about this I was rudely told that the $80 was estimated, even though it was double, and welcome to Arizona. The next thing I was told that my car was a Yaris, the smallest car that Toyota makes. I tried to argue this, but was told it their \""Standard\"" car. When I got to where the car was I asked someone else, who said that I was supposed to have gotten a \""Mid Size.\"" So now I am driving a Versa, the smallest Nissan car made, and paying $80 more than their closet competitor for a \""Standard\"" car and $100 more than a  \""Mid Size.\"" I will NEVER rent from Hertz again."
"5","Went today to drop off camaro I rented returned quick and easy and picked up new car for 2nd stage of my vacation picked up r/t challanger fast and easy once again Hertz A+++"
"1","Horrible service. 1 attendant checking in cars, at least 20 cars waiting at any point in time. We had to wait over 15 mins to get checked out. Customer service representative was rude when I asked nicely if they could get more attendants out."
"5","Killer little sandwich spot. They used to have a deli downtown, but now just do sandwiches and pasts. Fresh bread, killer Italian meats and super fresh veggies! I'm itchin to try some of the pasta dishes they have, but this is THE spot for a rockin Italian sandwich!"
"3","I found myself in a bind (and not the kinky kind) last Friday when, after spending all my allotted \""costume shopping time\"" dealing with car issues, I faced the threat of having to appear at a Halloween party sans costume. Quelle horreur! \n\nI had six hours to find a costume that would befit a woman of my fabulous reputation. Deciding that this was far more important than, you know, helping students scan documents or walking professors through checking their e-mail, I picked up the office phone and started making calls.\n\nFirst I called Torrid. I wasn't thrilled at their selection, but I'm a fashion-minded plus-size girl, and they fit that niche. While I was tempted to get their flight attendant costume (I would've put on some corpse paint and gone as a \""Fright Attendant\""...get it? Get it? Fuck you, tool, I know I'm funny), Misty S and I have a rule about dressing up as each other's parents. I don't dress up as a flight attendant, and she doesn't dress up in an air force uniform. It's helped save our relationship.\n\nThey had a Ms. Lovett costume (\""The Barber's Mistress?\"" Really?) but some hosebeast I work with and totally hate was going as that at another party, and she hand-made her costume and I could not possibly stand to have my costume compared to hers. So that went.\n\nI got the idea to go as Little Red Riding Hood. Having exhausted my options at Torrid and not quite daring enough to risk the vomitorium that is Party City, I looked up Easley's. \n\nBack when I was a mere Theater major (you called it, huh?) Easley's was synonymous with \""knows their shit\"". Everyone who took costuming/cosplay/halloween parties (too) seriously went there. It was a name I could trust. In fact, I still have all the makeup I've bought from them over the years tucked away in a First Aid box (one day someone will figure out it doesn't contain gauze...but until then I can't afford a new box). So I gave it a try.\n\n\""Easley's, how may I help you?\""\n\""Yeah, I was looking on your site, do you have the Plus Size Miss Red Riding Hood costume in stock?\""\n*Sounds of checking inventory* \""No, we don't, but we do have the other one, with the long black skirt, and we found another one not on the site.\""\n\""Describe it to me, please?\""\n\""Corset with gold braiding, short black skirt, red hood.\""\n\""Oh wow. That sounds perfect. Can I have you hold it for me so I can come by and see?\""\n\""No. You have to pay for them online before we can hold them.\""\n\""But you said it's not available online.\""\n\""Oh, we're going to upload it to the site right now.\""\n\""Oh, okay, I see it...but...there's no picture.\""\n\""Yeah. We don't have a picture of it. It'll be $39.95.\""\n\""Wait, I'm supposed to pay for this sight unseen? Can't you just set it aside? I'll be there in like an hour. I can't afford to pay for this, drive over there and find that it doesn't fit, I don't like it, etc.\""\n\""Sorry, no, we can't.\""\n\""Ugh, okay. Thank you.\""\n\nDesperate (and a little curious) I went to order the mystery costume, and what do you know, not only was it invisble, but shape-shifting. Once in my checkout cart the price had changed (WITH MAGIC!) to 53.95. \n\nI called back. And was put on hold.  \n\nYeah, that's great, Endlessly Looping Sound Clip, but I really don't give a shit about the rental policy. I just want my costume.\n\nI ended up hanging up. I wasn't even sure I could afford the costume even if it was only 39.95.\n\nSo I went home, threw on the pink tafetta nightmare I wore at Fetish Prom, slipped on a domino mask and some high heeled boots and went as a prom queen dominatrix. I was the life of the party\n\nI know it sounds a little harsh of me to give them a 3 star for this one mixup, but seriously, I've never needed to get plastic involved to get anyone to hold something for me. I don't see what makes Easley's so special. What are the odds of another full-figured girl walking in within that hour time frame screaming \""QUICK! I NEED A SEXY LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD STAT!\"" \n\nI say relatively low, but that's only because I don't want to imagine that there's another me out there in the world. I'm enough.\n\nAfter the Halloween fervor I fully intend to stop by and see if they have that costume available still. Because it sounds fabulous. But I think it's important to know whether or not it'll make my ass look fat before I make the commitment."
"5","I followed Jillian to Volr salon and I love it there! Jillian always has creative new colors and styles for me to try out. I leave feeling beautiful every time and I get many compliments on my hair. Everyone wants to know where I get my hair done and I always point them to Jillian at Volr!"
"2","Went to pick up my dry cleaning and was told that the delivery with my clothes had not arrived yet. The lady in the back acted as if I had been arguing with her when she said \""there is nothing I can do sir!\"" I said, \""no problem, I'll come back tomorrow.\"" I then came back that next evening where they accidentally included someone else's clothes with my order, which I didn't notice until I had already arrived at home. I called to notify them and the same lady scolded me a bit by saying \""Well...that's why we ask you to check your order so that doesn't happen!\"" ....So now you expect your customers to be your quality control! Seems to me that the employees should check to make sure they are not making mistakes...not the customer. It didn't help that the girl behind the counter (literally 12 inches away from me) was texting  and made me wait for a second to finish her thought before even acknowledging me!"
"3","Went here today for lunch. Got the beef brisket sandwich with provolone on onion potato bun with fries and a soda. The beef was super tender and juicy and the fries were some of the best I've ever had (they're battered and very crispy). \nThe downfall is that this is somewhat of a cafeteria environment (noisy and you stand in line to get your food) and they still charge nearly $12 for a sandwich, side, and soda. I was also not asked to pick my side - I wanted soup - but they threw the fries on there without asking. While the food was delicious, it was overpriced with mediocre service. I might go back but it's unlikely."
"3","It is a clean place and they have good service. The Koi pond is pretty cool. The sandwich I ordered was pretty awful, don't get the turkey because it is like packaged meat you can buy at a supermarket. The prices were on par with other delis, but you can get a much better sandwich for the same price elsewhere."
"2","I like Miracle Mile Better... We had 2 sandwiches and 2 drinks 28.00 ... Who charges 2.18 for a drink... They were cheap on the BBO..."
"2","Okay, unfortately SW Airllines needs to train their employees better.\nSW Airlines can only issue to a passenger two (2) boarding passes in a travel day. Example: Travel day 12/1; traveing from PHX to GEG with connecting flight in OKL (changing airplanes), got two boarding passes; got to GEG did my business and got an boarding pass at GEG with stop in LAS (no change of planes). It's frustrating because GEG was a full (over booked) flight."
"5","My friend and I went here before a Suns game and waited 45 minutes to get in.  I knew this place was going to be good because all the famous sports players like Amare love to go there.  After the wait, we were allowed inside and we were starving.  We were instantly greeted by the owner/manager Larry White and he wasted no time getting us some sweet tea and Kool-Aide (I wish every place served Kool-Aide).  We both got the Lo Lo's plate which consisted of 3 pieces of chicken and 2 large waffles.  The food came out quickly and we didn't waste anytime chowing it down. The chicken was fantastically seasoned and breaded and the waffles were outstanding.  We were very satisfied with our meal and preceeded to the Suns game. Although the Suns lost by 30 points to the Pistons, the trip from Tucson was well worth it because of Lo Lo's."
"3","I just had lunch there. It was decent but honestly I'm not sure where all of the top notch ratings are coming from. The chicken was good, and the waffles were good, but not \""oh my god, I HAVE to come back good\"". I probably wouldn't even consider taking my out of town friends here. I'll have to try Stacy's or Mrs.Whites."
"4","This was my second visit. and it went much like the first.  we both had the soul food platter with chicken. really good mac and cheese and it stayed pipping hot throughout the whole meal not sure how but it was nice. really good waffle I couldn't stop eating it, fried okra you can skip its just like little nuggets of fried zucchini but with nothing to dip them in. and dry as a bone cornbread even though it had a full scoop of butter on top when it arrived. The chicken was really good the only complaint there was the wings were dry, super good homemade lemon aide I drank two quart size jars full of it good. service was attentive and lots of different people that worked there came around to check on you so you were never in want of anything. Saw lots of people coming in to get takeout so thats a nice option, next time I will get extra chicken to go because its so good cold the next day."
"2","Fried chicken was good, but everything else was a joke.  The service was unbelievably bad.  The waffles were skinny and underdone.  First cup of grits had a tiny amount of butter and were way overdone, like they were scrapped out of the bottom of the pan.  When a second waitress saw what was in my bowl, and saw my dry ass overdone eggs (this was 5 minutes after they were brought out....I was still waiting for the chicken and waffles) she offered to bring new eggs and grits.  Second round, (still no chicken and waffles) eggs were much better but grits were underdone and watery.  When the chicken and waffles showed up, the waffles were already cool with no browning at all.  Coffee was terrible.  Wife's plate was just as bad.  Our original waitress never bothered to check on us until she brought the bill.  And to top it all off, the food is way overpriced, and over hyped!!!\nThe one solid was the chicken.  It was lightly battered and perfectly seasoned and cooked.  The scrambled eggs were real, not the fake crap.  I just wish someone in the back new how to cook them properly.  With the exception of the one waitress who replaced my first plate, it seemed like no one there, including the cooks, really gave a shit about the food or the service.  Very disappointing considering all the good reviews."
"2","Stopped in at Lo-Lo's after Disney on Ice about a week ago. We arrived on a Saturday night about 6 and to our surprise the place wasn't crowded..actually got a parking place right in front. When we walked in a woman yelled sit any where..then someone else yelled..y'all have to wait. so we waited..and waited. Mind you that several tables in plain view were available. After we were seated..without menus, we waited another 10 minutes before someone came back to the table with our menus..we didn't really need the menus for we have been to Lo-Lo's several times. Waited another 15 minutes for someone to take our order..a Betty Boop, a Tre Tre, a plain waffle for the child, 1 sweet tea, 1 unsweeted tea, 1 red kool-aid. Took another 10 minutes to get our drinks.  Again..not busy. The waitress brought out the Tre Tre and Betty Boop but not the waffle for our son..had to wait another 10 minutes to flag someone down to bring his waffle..long story short, the chicken and waffles were amazing as always, but the unsweeted tea was on the verge of souring..and the service was just plain awful. Lo-Lo's gets extremely buzy, especially on Sunday mornings and we have never had a problem, maybe it was an off night..but for the life of me I don't understand why it took us almost 2 hours for 3 pieces of fried chicken and 3 waffles."
"5","I heard about this place from overhearing a conversation at a table behind me at another restaurant.  The folks were raving about it.  I had never heard of chicken and waffles before and the thought intrigued me.  I went by myself to check it out before I told friends or brought anyone with me....pretty skeptical.   I was blown away!  The food was AMAZING, the service was phenomenal and all the staff was extremely warm and friendly.  I honestly felt like I was a guest at a friends home for dinner.  I have \""invited myself\"" back several times since and has been phenomenal each time."
"3","I was visiting Phoenix for the first time and Yelped what seemed to be the best place to eat.  Lo-Lo's popped up towards the top of the list.  I've never had chicken and waffles before - I'm not a huge fan of fried chicken (waffles are OK), but wanted to try it out at least once.  This seemed like a good place to go....although I had a feeling the place was going to be overrated. \n\nWhile I don't know the Phoenix area well, the restaurant seemed to be located in the industrial boonies - the street looked a bit sketchy, and there was this ghettoish sign painted on a building pointing you to the way of Lo-Lo's.  There was plenty of street parking, and I don't recall seeing a parking lot.  It's a cute looking shop - shaped like a tiny house decorated with some neon lights.  \n\nThe place is small - I recall about 6 or 7 tables and the restaurant had most of the tables occupied on a Friday night.  Definitely not a place for big groups unless you want to take over the entire restaurant.  It's a casual spot - waiter service is casual as well.  You don't have a dedicated waiter - they have 2 or 3 people on staff to help the customers as needed (which makes sense for such a small place).\n\nI'm not quite sure why, but it took us a little while to order - there were a decent amount of items on the menu, but because the menu items were mainly combinations of the same thing, we were confused on what/how to order.  For our party of 3, we ended up ordering (I think):  Baby Ray ($13 or 12), Lo-Lo's ($12 or 11), and Stupid Fries ($8).  This place should really be a $$ rating vs. $ - our total bill including tax ended up to be a bit over $40 including tax & tip.  This was just for 2 entrees and 1 appetizer.\n\nFood came in a reasonable amount of time - probably about 10 to 15 minutes.  Portions were reasonably sized - not too big or small.  We had 5 or 6 pieces of chicken and 4 or 5 waffles to share.  The chicken was OK - I didn't find anything special about it.  Meat was tender and the crust was OK.  It helped adding some hot sauce and vinegar to help enhance the flavor.  Waffles were OK - could have been a bit better if the outside was crispier.  \n\nOverall, this place was OK - it wasn't exactly a place to rave home about.  One of the people at our table compared it to Roscoe's and said it was about the same or Roscoe's was a bit better."
"5","I have a strange habit of always searching for chicken and waffles in any city that I visit. \nSo there I was in Phoenix for the weekend and I came across reviews for Lo-Lo's. The reviews looked right, so off we went...\n\nI can see why some people say it's located in a sketchy area, but everyone knows that's where you find the best food!\nIt was about 1pm on a Saturday and the place was packed, but we got seated right away. \n\nI had the number 3, Lo-Lo's - 3 piece, 2 waffles, and a side of corn bread. My girlfriend had Puff's Chicken Tender Basket and we shared some mac & cheese.\n\nThe food was excellent, especially the corn bread! \nThe service was great, we had about 4-5 different people walk by and ask us how we were doing.\n\nAlso, I loved the mason jars.\n\nSee you next time I'm in Phoenix!"
"1","This is the first restaurant that I've been asked to leave because there were customers waiting outside.  We waited about 10 minutes to get in; sat down and received water and coffee, 5 minutes later put in our order and received our food within ~7 minutes.  We ate and chatted.  As soon as we got the bill the young gal said we needed to hurry and leave because there were customers waiting for seats.  To boot the food wasn't that good either."
"5","Yummmmm! Everything was tasty, the koolaid took me back! Wish we had saved room for red velvet cake!"
"5","This is a must try if you are ever in phx! There are two locations which one is in downtown phoenix and the other in Scottsdale. After a night of partying and some great home cooked meals or just the craving for something sweet yet salty this place will hit the spot. I love that they make their own kool-aid and also have a variety of flavors. The Mac N Cheese is to die for along with their cornbread. I have had everything from the breakfast sandwhich, catfish, chicken wings, chicken strips, breast, and waffles with none of them falling short from excellent."
"2","Boo on the Food! This place is way over hyped. They tried to charge $7 for a little waffle and 2 cold, greasy chicken thighs. Not impressed at all. The only reason it gets 2 stars is because the waiter was nice and the place looked cool. \n\nFirst impressions are everything, so they say, and in this instance I would agree. Since moving here over a year ago I have heard people go on and on about Lolo's chicken and waffles, especially when they find out I moved from the south. \""Oh it is the best soul food\"", \""They have the best fried chicken I have had anywhere..\"" are some of the things people have said. We live in Mesa and there is not a location near us but this morning  we were running errands in Phoenix and drove about 15 minutes out of our way so I could finally try this place that so many people have raved about. The place was decorated nice, it was not too long after they opened and it was not busy, we were seated right away. Took about 10 minutes before we saw a server, our drinks were brought out fairly quick and our order taken. Our food came out pretty quick but what difference does quick service make when the food is cold? The skin on the chicken was not even crisp on the edges, they had obviously been sitting around for a while. I tried a bite anyway, good fried chicken is good hot or cold and this was not good. It had the overwhelming taste of flour and I think the cook forgot to put seasoning on it at all. When the waiter came over to check on us I told him the chicken was cold and I didn't want it, at first he took the plate back and didn't say anything at all, when he brought the check he apologized. I have heard people say how good it is and maybe my experience is isolated but if it really was an uncommon experience then why didn't the waiter seemed surprised when I returned it? Why didn't he offer to get me a fresh plate? Why didn't a manager come over to see what they problem was or to apologize? Maybe they are used to serving sub-standard food, that is the only thing I can think of. This place reminds me of a lot of places that were really good until they got popular, quality of food and service goes down, prices go up and the only reason they stay in business is because they are \""cool\"" or trendy. \n\nBottom line - Don't think I will try this place again, there are so many really good restaurants to try in the Phoenix area and when you are going to spend an average of $10+  per person to sit down & eat somewhere, the food should at least be fresh. \n\nOh yeah, one more thing, a glass jar of kool-aid should never cost $3, unless you get to take the jar with you."
"3","the food was only okay.... if you're in the mood for comfort food it would hit the spot. the fried chicken and the cornbread (baked sweet, just the way I like it) are good and if I came back I would order those. however, the waffle was disappointing :-/ it was flimsy and soft, whereas I like my waffles to be crispy on the outside and thicker.\n\nthe service here was OUTSTANDING. everyone from the hostess to the servers were extremely friendly and attentive and happily made us a custom drink (half sweet tea, half regular tea... bc the sweet tea alone is way too sweet!)."
"5","Next time I'm in Phoenix this is my first stop! I ordered the Lo Los with a side of green beans and corn bread. WOW, I love that southern cooking! The sweet tea was amazing and at how many places can you order Kool-Aid on tap!"
"3","OK, I have made it to the shirne, the taj mahal, the paradise of chicken and waffles places in Phoenix.  Or at least that's what all the reviews said I should think of the place.\n\nYeah, I found it OK.\n\nHave i had better friend chicken?  Yes, many times.\n\nHave I had better waffles?  Yes, many times.\n\nBut have Iever had chicken and waffles in the same meal?  No, and for that I give them a star.\n\nPersonally, I found the chicken over cooked and too salty.  Yes, it is very fresh, crispy and piping hot.  \n\nI found the waffles just average.  I started to think that maybe no one makes waffles at home anymore, because from my point of view the waffles are just as good at my house.\n\nI did have a side of sting beans and red potatoes.  The beans definately looked like they came out of an institutional can, not fresh.  However, I have to say mushy as they were, they were pretty good and a surprise tastiness considering their appearence.\n\nThe location was easy to find, I even found street parking.\n\nThe staff was a big plus.  They are ever present and attentive, very freindly and helpful. Worth another full star. The decor is simple and the interior was very clean and bright.\n\nSo for iced tea, three pieces of chicken, two waffles, beans and potatoes and a slice of red velvet cake to take home, my bill with tip was $30.  For me that was a bit pricey and may not be worth it.  I will give it another shot again later, when I can take someone else to get their opinion."
"1","I will NEVER go AGAIN. I went with a LARGE crew intown for bike week. I first brought them to this place a few yrs ago, before they rebuilt the new place downtown. The owner was nice and humble. Appreciated all 30 PLUS people that came in. Each yr they now come into town they ALL stop in and eat. \n\nThis yr, they rebuilt and EVERY single staff member acted too good or busy.. including the owner. I ordered a SALAD . HOW HARD IS A SALAD WITH CHICKEN. NEVER CAME the owner was very rude and did not care. I will never go again. \n\nOne thing people shouldn't do is forget who you are, WHERE you came from and WHO got you there. Black people ( sorry not about race..BUT) Black people have been supporting LoLos and religiously going from jump. All the sudden you get alil change in pocket...and change ?  You are never too far up... to fall down !\n\n#FAIL. \n\np.s. This review is late, and only now thought to do it, as I wanted some lolos today...and recalled the rudeness and said..no go."
"5","A must-stop over when you're in the Phoenix area. Best southern food i've ever had! Far better than Roscoe's hands down. Their fried chicken is nicely seasoned. Not too much batter so when you bite into it, you're getting the right amount of crunch without the doughy taste. And it's juicy too! Even the breast. Their house made hot sauce is perfect on everything. I also ordered the biscuits and gravy. Biscuits were soft and fluffy and the gravy was legit too! And the service we got was really good. Def coming back when i get another chance."
"5","I had the best breakfast ever at Lo-Lo's. My husband heard about this place from one of his friends and we just had to check it out while we were in Phoenix from Virginia for a wedding. We are so glad we did, the food is A-m-a-z-i-n-g and the service is just as wonderful!  The waffles were some of the best I have ever had at a restaurant and the chicken was done just right! Yum! :) I wish we had better places like this in our area. We hope to eat here again next time we are in Phoenix! :)"
"5","Having been a bookmark on my Yelp account for some time now, we finally got the chance to try this place out! We headed in and were greeted right away. We didn't have a reservation, but we lucked out and got there earlier than the rush, so we were seated in a nice booth up front.  The place filled up pretty quickly after we arrived, so I would recommend calling ahead if you have a larger party (and they only seat your party once everyone has arrived, so keep that in mind, too).\n\nOur waitress was Leslie and she was wonderful from the very start.  Friendly and accommodating she allowed us a bit of time to look over the menu and made recommendations based on our preferences, which worked out nicely.  I had the Lo-Lo's meal and he had the Double D meal, we shared an order of cornbread, cause...who turns down southern style cornbread?? We opted to try out a couple of their drinks which I cannot remember the names of, but they were good! \n\nThe meals came out quickly an were exactly the way we ordered them and they smelled amazing. Chicken was cooked nicely and the breading was really well seasoned. Waffles were fluffy and perfect. The cornbread was gone within seconds of hitting the table. \n\nDespite being way too full for it, we shared a banana pudding for a dessert, which was worth every agonizingly over full bite! I highly recommend this if you from the south and like a good banana pudding with real slices of banana and wafer topping!\n\nOverall: A+\nGreat service, great southern food with hilarious names (amazing dessert for a bonus), and fun ambiance make this place a \""will absolutely return\"" venue!"
"4","I came here with a girlfriend and were told the wait would be 45 min.  \n\nWe left for 30 min and came back only to find that we had missed them calling us. AH!\n\nWe let the ladies know we were there and they (very sweetly) accommodated us, (probably because we were only two people and fit on a postage stamp).\n\nI did not have the Kool Aid, but an alcoholic beverage at the top of their \""drinks\"" menu and it was FANTASTIC. I\""m almost positive it had red Kool Aid, vodka and pineapple juice.\n\nI ordered Betty's Boob, a perfect combo to taste their chicken and SCRUMPTIOUS waffle and then ordered Mac & Cheese and Cheese Grits on the side.  \n\nThe Betty's Boob was AMAZING.  The waffle was scrumptious and the chicken skin was fabulous.  The meat itself was juicy, but not in the right way.  The interior meat was a little dry, but the outer meat was juicy.  But I'm nitpicking. \n\nWe were told the Mac was amazing, and I will say as a Mac and Cheese aficionado, it was not good.  It was not creamy in any sense, and was definitely more Southern in style as it was Mac you could build with (thick).  Not the creamy type I have come to adore.  \n\nThe Cheese Grits were gone in a matter of seconds. I LOVED them.\n\nWe also ordered Red Velvet cake at the end, to see what all of the fuss was about and it was BAD.  The driest and least cocoa-y Red Velvet cake I have ever had.  The cream cheese icing is so cloyingly sweet, it almost hurt my teeth going in.  I would like to see their recipe include more oil/egg to give a more moist texture.  \n\nI will say I smelled Collard Greens walking buy me all morning and WISHED I had ordered them instead of my Mac.  I will DEFINITELY order them next time.\n\nOur waitress was AMAZING and when I walked away from my birthday present under the table, a nice guy came up and made sure I didn't leave without it.\n\nNormally from food alone, this would get a 3, but I want to try a BUNCH more sides that looked awesome, and the service was impeccable. :)"
"4","In search of authentic chicken and waffles I stumble upon LoLo's. The waffles were outstanding, the chicken was amazing and my two friends and I hardly spoke a word as we devoured each bite. The place was clean and the service was warm and friendly. Do yourself a favor and check it out. I know I will again."
"1","My wife ate at LoLo's, brought home a dinner for me, chicken dinner. The chicken was dry and over cooked, no taste.  This dinner is not cheap, for the money, not worth it."
"3","I liked this place.  The ambiance is nice and the service is superb.  The mojito was delicious and so was the waffles.  My daughter was excited by the red velvet pancakes.  The down side was price - SO EXPENSIVE!  An order of pancakes was $13!  I can't afford to frequent this place very often."
"2","We've only been to one show, Louis CK, since the name change. Naturally, the two people sitting directly in front of me were freakishly tall. You'd think in the age of stadium seating that we'd have found a way to negate the problem of height differentials, but you'd be wrong. \n\nWe were seated in the right-hand section of the theater, so we were treated to a 90-minute view of the side of Louis CK's head, which is fine. He doesn't do a lot of physical humor, so we didn't miss out on much.\n\nComerica is a mediocre venue. Unless I'm absolutely thrilled about the performer, I won't consider another show here."
"2","My husband and I went to see Jerry Seinfeld at Comerica. First problem is that while he stood in line for beer, I had to stand in another line for liquor. And turns out, the line I was standing in wasn't even for liquor, but beer and some other random malt beverage. The liquor line was on the opposite side from the beer - it would be nice if people had a little more info.\n\nThe bartender that was running the liquor portion was ridiculously slow. I mean, so slow the wife of the guy in front of me left to go stand in line at the bathroom and came back before their drinks were made. OMG.\n\nThe seats are super tiny, very close together and pretty much have zero leg room. I'd hate to be tall and be sitting there. I wanted another drink but I didn't want to get up for fear of having massive leg cramps and not being able to walk back.\n\nOur view was decent, however the sound quality was terrible. Every time someone would talk into the microphone, it would echo all over the place and so we were listening to each joke twice."
"3","I could have sworn I wrote a review for this place back when it was Dodge Theater but I don't see it here so oh well. My husband and I went to see a Christmas concert here of The Piano Guys recently and that was the first time I've been here in a couple years. First off, I was shocked to see a line of people that extended down a full city block and then wrapped around and doubled back almost the whole way down the street. There were no dividers or ropes or any staff providing direction so everyone was confused as to where the line started and ended and I saw a ton of people \""taking cuts\"". It seems like they could come up with a better system for getting people in the door. Fortunately it moved pretty quickly so we still made it to our seats before the show started.\n\nMy biggest complaints about this place are that there are not enough restroom facilities and also that the drink prices are outrageous. I know, I know, you could say the same about almost any other concert venue in the valley but that is no excuse. As others have mentioned the seats are a little on the small side but not too uncomfortable. I do wish there was more leg room, mainly because once people are seated there is absolutely no room left for walking if you have a seat near the middle of a row. I will say that the acoustics are great and the lighting and effects at the shows I have seen were wonderful. I also like that it is small enough that even the seats in the back can still see but I do wish that they had not put seats on the bottom sides where the edges of the stage block your view. They do warn you when you buy the tickets that it is an obstructed view but really you can not see hardly anything. They should have just used that space for more bathrooms instead of seats that are basically worthless."
"5","After trying out a couple of chain salons, my Mom and I found Tan Aloha about 5 years ago and have been tanning here seasonally since. Nothing drastic, but if you work during the daylight hours it's an easy way to glow a little bit in the summer months!\nIt's a clean, comfortable atmosphere with much better rates than you will find at places like Celebrity Tanning. Plus they often have specials on their website or posted on their Instagram page which are AWESOME.\nI tanned at level 2 for a long time when I caught a great monthly deal for level 3. It is more pricey but the rumors are true that it is very worth it!! Tanning on the level 2 beds I came 3-4 times a week, but on level 3 I could go once or twice a week at MOST and I was just as tan, if not more tan than when I was at level 2. I am a believer!! \nThe girls are very sweet and helpful!! Ashley is lovely. I would recommend Tan Aloha to anyone!"
"5","Haven't had the chance to eat, but I've definitely had a chance to drink here!\n\nThey make this pomegranete mojito and martini, which is delicious!!!!  The bar gets really tight and noisy especially when there is  a convention going on, especially when there's a HAIR SHOW going on.  All the educators get drunk stupid, hyphy!!\n\nThe bartender we had was JP and he was so attentive.  Scott was cool too, but he wasn't as attentive as JP was.  When we were dry on drinks it was easy to get another round!!"
"1","Horrible service. Burger cooked wrong and it took 20 minutes to get it replaced. Definately not a place to visit if you have less than 2 hours for lunch.  Entree prices good but $3 for regular ice tea :("
"5","The address for this business is actually in Phoenix, inside Paradise Valley Mall, next to Penney's, we have been going to this business for many years, my husband loves this place, he will drive the extra miles, just to give this gentleman business, this business has moved a couple of times, but have settled in the Mall, he has fixed many leather purses for me, and my husbands shoes has lasted him years, because he just keeps replacing heels, and keeps them polished, a lot less money, than buying the Italian shoes ! I would recommend driving the extra miles, for this shoe stop, I have tried other places around my home in scottsdale, and my husband and I keep going back to this shoe stop !"
"4","Pretty nice theatre. Great vibes here."
"4","As a fairly discriminate gym hopper, I am surprisingly pleased with 24 hour fitness.  The staff is friendly and helpful. The facilities are pretty clean.  I have never had to share a lane in the pool (which is just irritating).  \n\nI was pretty amused by the um..variety of patrons.  I mean I have seen ALL types, sizes and ages here, which is really cool.  Definitely not your typical meat market gym.  \n\nMy only complaints are very  banal and useless, so I won't even bother.  Finding a gym I am comfortable at is the key to consistency for me, so I am super happy I decided to give 24 hour fitness a try."
"1","I have a membership to go to all the 24 hour fitness clubs since I work all over the valley. this is one that I have hit and now make it a point to NOT go there, even if it is convenient for me location wise. the main thing that bothers me is that it is kept at least 80 degrees. well if I wanted that, I would just go outside and get a workout. first of all , it is extremely hot to work out and secondly, the dressing rooms are even hotter. after a workout and a shower, I had to go to work. well I couldn't even dry off in the dressing room after the shower. it is so hot in there.  I drove to work with the AC blasting and still could not dry off.  I pay a lot of money to belong to 24 hour fitness. I can't believe that they can't keep the gym at at least room temperature!!! and lastly, I reach for some towels as i'm leaving and have packed my bag, but they can't even keep paper towels in the rest room / dressing room area. some other 24 hour fitnesses are better that this one. I hope the they improve upon this."
"4","Scale of 1-10 (single visit):\n9 Food\n9 Service\n9 Atmosphere\n7 Value\n\nBeing a Monday night it was slow, but regardless our server JD was excellently timed and attentive.  I got the Tommy burger (bacon & bleu cheese) with Cajun Fries and it was deeelicious!  It's a great location with yum yum food and friendly service so I'll return.  The only thing on my wish list would be a more exciting beer list.  The beer list wasn't bland - it had things I hadn't tried - but it wasn't special like Carly's."
"5","Best French Fries in Phoenix  hands down. Order the Parmesean garlic fries and any burger on the menu and you won't be dissapointed.\n\nWed nights they run a $5 burger special for one of their burgers but you need to ask them about their special.  \n\nCool Local/Ind resturant for wine and good food."
"2","stopped in about a week ago on a Sat night but didn't stay long.  The music didn't fit the ambience.  It would fit a sports bar better.  I expected to hear some music you could have a conversation while eating.  They sat us in the back as far away as possible but it was still too loud.  This atmosphere would do better with maybe a piano player, soft jazz, etc.  Will not go back there again.  If you are looking for a wine bar then this is not it."
"1","Wanted to try this place out. Went last night and it has been closed down ! Nothing inside and a couple of letters hanging on window from the state."
"2","I have been going to Bill Johnson's since the 1970s.  I haven't been to the one on Van Buren in years, but I used to love that location.  However, I can only speak of my recent experiences at this location, and they have left a lot to be desired.  \n\nNormally I don't try a place more than twice if I have a bad experience, but since I recall Bill Johnson's with such fondness, I gave them more opportunities than I probably should have.  After four consecutive visits I can say that this location is very consistent.  Unfortunately, it has been consistently mediocre at best.  So here goes...\n\nI waited a long time to be greeted at the front.\n\nI waited even longer for the waitress to come around.\n\nI waited longer still to have her return with our food after ordering.  \n\nThe food seemed like it was made before I even ordered it.  \n\nThe burgers were smaller than I remember.  To say the steak looked like it was a Denny's breakfast steak is an insult to Denny's, and at least Denny's is cheap.  The ribs were barely room temperature.  The best thing was the fish sticks on the kids menu, which makes no sense considering there is an angry bull on the front of the restaurant.  Come to think of it, maybe that is why he is angry. \n\nI'm still a sucker for all the junk hanging everywhere.  I wish they would replace the light bulbs in some of their Conestoga Wagons, but I would settle for fresh food that didn't take an eternity to arrive at my table.  On second thought, I would settle for the way it used to be."
"1","okay I really really really want to give kudos to this restaurant due to it being a Phoenix icon.  however they are struggling  financially right now and I think the reason is that while other steakhouses have embraced the fact that people want to eat healthier, adding salads and less filling foods to their menu, this place has decided to keep a very old school steakhouse fried chicken mantra.  I am gluten free and can only order ribs or chicken with no barbecue sauce.  I do have breakfast but it stops at noon which would alleviate the problem of me trying  trying to find something to eat.  because of the lack of items that I can eat, combined with the fact that my vegetarian daughter can find nothing to eat,  we won't be back so they  lost my entire family.  it's great to have traditions but you also have to change with the times."
"1","Will never come here again!!! We went there for breakfast a Saturday morning. They took forever to take our order, bring us drink and to bring our order. Waitress didn't know menu, she look so lost!!! when our order came back my eggs were cold and my house potatoes burned!!! Bad experience overall. I give them one star because I can't post without it :/"
"1","Bill Johnson's Has Lost Its Giddyup and Should Just Go\n\nA friend and popped into Bill Johnson's for lunch unplanned. We should have planned better. \nNow looking for a lighter fare perhaps we shouldn't have tried a \""cowboy\"" establishment, but I was still craving some down home cooking after a disappointing trip to Chilleens on 17 (you can check out my review of them as well if you'd like), so we took a shot. \nService was friendly enough and they had Kiltlifter on tap; a redeeming grace for any establishment in my humble opinion. My friend tried a smothered chicken breast and I went for the saut\u00e9ed tilapia since I was wanting something a tad lighter. But I was still craving some good baked beans and a baked potato with the works sounds delicious. My friend went for the green beans and the interesting sounding green chile mac and cheese. \nThe food took a while to get there. So long that I was beginning to think the fish was a good choice since clearly they were having to still catch it and kill it. When it arrived I was far from impressed. The sides were lukewarm at best yet the fish was hot; telling me that things sat around waiting for the cook to prepare my fish. I now wish they had found somewhere else to go. \nWhile my friend's chicken wasn't bad with peppers and onions and cheese, the smothering was hiding a near inedible edge to the breast. Clearly cooked at too hit a temp and ruining the edges of the meat. My fish had received the same treatment. Add over spicing with pepper and some loathsome lemon butter goo, and you get a relatively unpleasant meal.  \nThe sides were no better. Bland canned baked beans once again and the \""cheese\"" sauce was as runny as water in the mac and cheese. \nThis review seems somewhat redundant after all the other bad reviews if this place, but now I know to check the Yelp before moseyin' into this corral."
"5","Highly recommend Caroline for eyebrow waxing. Nice touch, great attitude, & funny!\n\n(Highly recommend not being Indian if you want to avoid eyebrow waxing.)"
"2","It's unfortunate that some of my favorite stores are no longer in the Biltmore and it's remodel by Westcor makes it look like all the other strip malls in AZ.... what happened to the old Phoenix Charm?  Where did it go?\n\nRumor has it that Biltmore pushed Banana Republic out and Restoration Hardware.  I know Gucci left b/c the rent was raised so high, they said F YOU- we are heading to Scottsdale, leaving the expensive eye wear to be purchased as Saks.\n\nI also heard that all the restaurants will be gone and condos will be going in there and up--- is this true????  Someone tell me!!!!\n\nThe most disappointing is the charm of the Biltmore is gone.  It's still pretty and nice to walk around but the charm is far gone.  It's unfortunate.  \n\nAlthough, my friends and I do think that there is an unwritten rule that only cute adorable children and precious doggies are allowed on the property and they must frolic and play on the grass.  So if you got an ugly kid, leave him in the car ala Britney Spears style."
"2","This is a very high end mall and not somewhere that I would buy anything. There are tons of fashion/clothes shops, so perhaps it's good if you like that sort of shopping. There is also an Apple store, which is cool. I visited on a Saturday afternoon. There was almost no parking available and the stores were overcrowded. For the number of large and fancy malls in the Phoenix area, this one doesn't measure up for me."
"4","I like coming here because it's the only shopping center I have ever been to that's actually a park. It's very pet friendly, and fitness friendly too. \n\nEvery restaurant there has good food, although they are very busy, so sometimes you can expect a wait. \n\nThere's plenty of parking, both self and valet, covered and uncovered.\n\nThe only reason it's 4 stars is that it's not for everyone. Most shops are upscale, and beautiful, but not particularly budget friendly.\n\nI'm on the fence though, because it's also a park, so there are plenty of free activities to do besides shop.\n\n4.5"
"5","Good parking. Although I am upset I had to pay $1 for my 30 minute parking. But that's Scottsdale for you. Nothing is always free. Even parking. Ilove all the shops here but they could update the map of the area because they are missing new places that have opened up."
"2","If you're only needing a cleaning, this is a safe bet. The hygenists are polite and do quality work. However, for fillings,it was the most painful, unpleasant,disappointing experience.\n\nI already had fillings by a dentist out of state & knew I needed one more for sure. Dr Shim wanted to do  5 fillings including replacing a few silver ones that were only a few yrs old ( That should've been the 1st clue!). I trusted and allowed 3. The anesthetic,he admitted,was too strong - numb literally to my eyeball plus I suffered bruising at the injection site.Dr Shim is very quick, deliberate, firm and has an aggressive approach. I had to make a 40 mile round trip to his other office the following morning because the original office was closed & he hallowed out so much out of the middle of the 3 teeth that it left the outside edges thin and sharp. When I got there he shaved down those sharp edges. Now when I chew food it feels like I have baby teeth there that don't do anything. When I told him these teeth are now short & my bite is uneven, his response was \""I can't control that\"" and \""Well, we need to do more fillings on the other side anyway\"".\n\nI sent a written complaint to the office. There was no written reply."
"5","Moved from Phoenix ten years ago but still crave a cheese pizza and buffalo wings from this place."
"1","Ate dinner there tonight and was very disappointed. It was very loud in the restaurant side of the place. T.Vs blaring with the sound on multiple different stations. \n\nWe ordered 2 different pizzas and when ordering I specifically asked the waitress if the mushroom were fresh or canned. She assured me they were fresh. Being they had stuffed portobello mushrooms on the menu, I thought they must be fresh. \n\nOur pizzas came out with slimy canned mushrooms. The dough was good. Nice and thick but the canned flavor ruined the whole quality of the pie. \n\nWe also waited 15 minutes after we were all finished with the meal for the waitress to come and ask how the meal was and get the check. She, nor the manager offered to take off any portion of the bill. \nOver priced. Poor service. We will not be back."
"3","I had never heard of Pullano's before tonight and decided to try this place out because we had a great value coupon.\n\nMy fiance loved the spaghetti and the meatballs were really good. The pizza however was just OK. It had an odd sauce that was too salty, although it wasn't necessarily bad. The bread sticks were nothing to get excited over.\n\nThe restaurant itself looked like a lot of fun, but we ordered take-out. We decided that this place was a little expensive for what it was and it probably isn't somewhere we would go without a coupon."
"2","I've definitely had better pizza. I ordered half peperoni/pineapple & half combo. Like others have said, the toppings DO fall off. Even the pineapple was falling off which shouldn't happen... The mushrooms on the combo side were from a can in water. They were pure white and floppy; I picked them off. The pizza was Extremely greasy, like overly greasy. The crust tasted similar to Domino's. I would not recommend this place."
"3","Nothing fancy about this place, it's your typical Denny's restaurants.  It's open 24 hours a day, so it's good for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  You can order breakfast food during night time and dinner during day time.  They don't care what time it is, they will fill you up anyway they can get.  Also, they offer free birthday meal, just show up and let them know it's your birthday and they'll pay for your meal, easy like that."
"3","Bad feeling about foods and services. We came with 2 women, 3 men and 2 kids, the waiter fogot to bring the drink for us, the beef burn when they fried and used to make the salad."
"1","My negative experience with Sharona Optical and their apparently affiliated Horizon Eye Specialists & LASIK Center has been too long and involved to recount without boring a reader to tears, but the bottom line is it's been REALLY bad for me.\n\nI would only recommend them to a prospective eye care patient if (for some awful reason) I hated them a lot, and wanted them to beat their head against a wall until it bleeds.\n\nI'm getting a headache right now just thinking about having made the mistake of doing business with them."
"3","Food is fine. Same as any other McDonalds. Clean as any other McDonalds. \nParents: the play area sucks. For very young, under 2 theres a toddler slide and an area to put some balls in a hole. Ok for little ones. Anyone else it's just a caged area with 2 balls. Really not fun for anyone over 2. Go to a different play place with the towering playground and slides.\nBut on the positive my 2 yr old was bored enough to eat all her chicken nuggets, so that's something."
"4","So this place re-opens under new management as the all-new Wet'n'Wild water park in a week or two.  Sounds awesome if you look at their website and interactive map and a preview of all the thrill rides.  The landscaping looks to be much better too.  It's about time the hottest, fastest-growing and fifth largest city in the nation had an A-List theme park when SoCal has about ten alone!  When I see the Travel Chanel's \""Top Ten U.S. Water Parks\"" they blow all of ours away.  I hope they re-engineer the wave pool with rolling waves, so that you can ride them like at Big Surf, instead of the intermittent \""undulation\"" it had here before and at Golfland Sunsplash in Mesa.\n\nAlthough it wasn't opened its first year by June, it will run all the way until the end of October and season passes are discounted at $59.99 before opening day.  They can be purchased at their website address: http://phoenix.mywetnwild.com/\n\nFor the latest info regarding their grand opening and a chance to win free season passes you can also follow them through Twitter at http://twitter.com/wetnwildphx and become a friend on Facebook at http://www.facebook.com/pages/Phoenix-AZ/Wet-n-Wild-Waterpark/84174876135."
"5","Great Salon, Excellent prices and you love the work they do.  Ask for Sherry I use her I wont go anywhere else."
"2","Was shopping around for a battery as the one in my car completely died. I called this store (among many others) and they had a great warranty- 3 years replacement, following 5 years prorated. After doing research I purchased a battery online at pepboys.com, with a 25% discount over $100 spent. I called again to ask if they had a discount for an oil change with a battery purchase (for a different car) and they said yes it would be $15. I told them I would pick up my battery and like an oil change and they said it would be no problem to get my in. Upon arriving to pick up my battery I was told it would be up to 3 hours for an oil change. We left and called a few days later and tried to make an appointment for an oil change and they kept telling me to just come in but I insisted on an appointment. We came in at 9 am when they opened and they had no record of our appointment. They took us right away but the oil change took an hour and half! and they left the maintenance light on! They also did not want to honor the $15 discount. Super annoying and frustrating working with this store, bad customer service. Would not recommend."
"4","\""You can whip our cream, but you can't beat our cheese!\""\n\nNice tagline, huh?\n\nI thought so... and I also think that Crow's Dairy Farmstead Goat Cheese (made from 100% fresh milk produced by Nubian dairy goats) is pretty fantastic.\n\nI've purchased both the regular goat cheese and the jalape\u00f1o flavor from the Old Town Farmers Market, and was extremely pleased... I hope to try the raspberry flavor next time!  (So far, I've enjoyed this melt-in-your-mouth treat in salads and on crackers and I'm sure there are plenty more ways to utilize it which I will be exploring soon.)\n\nI see on their website that \""their aim is to provide a quality product that the consumer can enjoy in a local restaurant, buy at a farmer's market or come to the farm to purchase. Plans are for the farm to be open for public sales in the spring of 2010.\""  Until then, you can find Crow's Dairy cheeses at farmers markets all around the Valley as well as at BLT Steakhouse, Chelsea's Kitchen, Calistro California Bistro, and Cheuvront Restaurant and Wine Bar.\n\nTry it... and thank me later!"
"3","This place is straight up hood.\n\nI turned down the street and a dog was just running around. my heart broke for that dog for the rest of the night :( I wanted to take him home, clean him up and give him to someone for christmas. \n\nI see this graffiti covered building. only, not really a building because there wasn't a door. just a tiny window. not just any window, but a bullet proof one. with prison bars on the outside? ummmm.......\n\nthe back doubled as a junk yard. vacuum? check. gnome? check. stray dog? random couch? check. check.\n\nmy friend shouts- this is it!!!! here it is!!! I'm so excited!!! \n\nuhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh \n\nthere were a lot of people hanging by this 'window', they were perhaps homeless?? convicts? i don't know.\n\nbut this place works like this: walk up to the window, place your order, and wait. \n\nmy friend was like 'im not bringing my whole purse up there, i don't want to get pick pocketed.' so I said, 'ok, i'll bring mine. it doubles as a weapon'. and we made our way up to the window.\n\nthe food was dirt cheap- we got two eggrolls, chicken fried rice, spicy chicken dinner, and 12 wontons and diet coke. we spent a total of $16.\n\nThe food was A-OK and while we waited even more people came to the window. this place was hoppin.  the fried rice was the best- it was super buttery and i loooovvveee butter. the chicken was plain old breaded and fried w a glossy 'spciy' (not really at all) sauce. the fried wontons were just decent, and the eggrolls were delish. but this is not a place i would come back to. for fear of being robbed. \n\ncall me angel princess, but i couldn't get over the 'ambiance' to chow down and not think twice about what type of quality meat i was eating at such cheap prices...\n\ntry it if you're brave because it was definitely tasty for the price....i think...."
"5","My first experience with The Bikini was after a shoot in PHX. The crew rattled on for an hour about The Bikini and we all finally went. I'm Glad. This is one of those places that I've heard alot about and couldn't wait to stop and have a brew. It did not disappoint either. It is the, umm, hipster, artfag, freaks and geeks place? If your clothes rarely match by accident or design, this is your place. A typical dive bar with some great local art adorning the walls, kickass jukebox and a pool table. Now that I've also finally been to First Friday, it seems the two go hand in hand. I love when I get to go there. It's not in my regular bar list, but only because I'm in TempE and hate to drive, let alone drink and drive."
"3","OK, so i went to the Bikini tonight and all i get is flashbacks of why i despise this place.\n\nthe funny thing is. the place is still exactly how it was the last time i was there. Hipsters out the ass. you can't move around without bumping into a hipster. the only other place where white t's are cool is in the bay area.\n\nI'm serious. you can't swing a hipster around by their ironic opinions without hitting another fucking hipster.\n\nlook bitches. if you look like everyone else. it's not exactly hip to look like that anymore. your just another trendy beatnick.\n\non a more comical side, looks like the Bikini is for sale again. hmm how many times has this place been for sale?\n\neven with a packed house full of hipsters this place will never sell for the couple mill they want for it.\n\nif a buyer does step up. they cant change it. or the clientele will leave. and honestly. the decor isn't worth the money. if you invest that much into it. you kinda want to upgrade a little.\n\none upside from my last review. looks like they got  new pool table. the felt looked taught. kudos. rock on kiddies."
"2","I struggle with the quantity of stars to bestow on this place. Maybe 2.5?\n\nI totally get that this is a dive bar. It is understandable that dive bars are suppose to leave residue on you when you leave. However, they shouldn't leave the lasting impression of scariness that this place does. \n\nI was greeted completely without any admirable candor (not that I should expect it). \""What do you want?\"" doesn't exactly ring in my ears as an invitation of welcome. I guess I also picked this place when apparently no one comes in. There was one other dude there. He looked like Santa Claus' illegitimate child. So, I would hope a hipper crowd parades around when Trunkspace is rocking. \n\nI suppose my biggest complaints are the lack of welcome that the whole place vibed to me; the inability to judge based on clientele (given what was there, I would guess a village of elves); and the lack of any clean surface in the place. Perhaps I am hasty to judge, but I will sit on my 2.5 until a better experience can raise that. I will presumably be drunk for that to happen."
"2","I hope you don't think that I'm too critical by the end of this review. \n\nBut honestly I've been to better dive bars. The first thing that struck me was the location. Crap! It shares a wall the the Trunk Space, on a corner of Grand Ave and 7th ave I believe. Getting there, maneuvering the strange sharp turns, and then locating a parking spot definitely downs my drinking enthusiasm.  -1 for initial placement. Although, if you happen to be catching a show at the Trunk Space, this place is 5 steps away. \n\nWhen I first entered the place, I admit I was impressed with the interior decor. The whole tiki-style theme was nice and consistent. Except for all the stuff behind the bar. I mean a piece of paper with a note written with a marker saying \""We have the right to refuse anyone service\"", just screams \""low class establishment here\"" to me. At least the air conditioning and lighting were comforting.\n\nThe service was decent. The lack of crowd allowed my party and I the utmost dedicated attention. I ordered a large pitcher of Blue Moon, which if you have a three person group, the price is pretty good. You get three smaller than usual frosted glasses which I liked. However, as a fan of Blue Moon, I was unimpressed by how bland the white ale tasted!! I'm sure it was flat. It was cold though. Ill give them that.\n\nOverall, I would come back again, but only if I happen to be at the Trunk Space. I see no reason to deliberately make this place my destination.\n\nBy the way this place is Cash Only......"
"3","This is a place that exists."
"4","My cousin showed me this place a few years ago when I turned 21, and it was a place I would have never taken a second glance at. It's on Grand Ave, a shady area, so during the week you definitely get the odd/scary crowd. Mostly homeless people or day laborers. I avoid the bar during the week, but Friday and Saturday nights are where it's at!! They've been having the same DJ who plays an amazing mix of indie music, electronic, and even oldies that have a beat added to them. On the weekends towards the tail-end of the night this place is always packed! I usually hate bars that are super crowded, but this is one I actually like. It adds to the whole Bikini experience. Usually it's a bunch of young hipsters, drinking, dancing, singing, and not giving a f*** about what anyone thinks. Bikini is awesome because everyone is usually super cool, and the drinks are super cheap! Like $3-$4. The bartenders seem very moody at times, but it's not a huge deal to me. I love the neon pictures and totems, and the streamers hanging from the ceilings are very fun."
"1","This is a tough review to write. On the one hand their cook is incredible! He's nice, remembers your order, and makes one of the best Breakfast Burritos in town! I would highly recommend getting the Bacon one and adding jalepenos. \n\nAlso, if you go there for lunch and get one of their specials, it is very generica cafeteria food. Of the items served on their specials, typically one is pretty good, one is really bad (to the point you can't eat it), and one is mediocre. \n\nWhile the food passes the test for cheap quick food, what kills this place in the ratings is the cashier's ability to be unfriendly, almost all of the time. If you go there just once or twice, you wouldn't even notice it. But, if you go there most days of the week for breakfast, it starts to ruin the great breakfast burrito.\n\nI'll still eat here, but if anyone recommends anywhere else, count me in!"
"2","To say we didn't fit in was a bit of a understatement, but my co workers have gotten used to this feeling when they go to lunch with me.\n\nHidden in a old small strip mall is Garden express. Inside is a menu board,  a order window and a few chairs to wait at, not eat at. In this respect it is like the Rtio's of Chinese food.\n\nThe look of the place is old and dirty, the menu board has a fair amount of dirt on it.\n\nUnable to locate a vegetable dish or tofu I asked what they had w/o meat.  This limited me to lo mein, chow mein or rice with veggies.  I went with the former. I ordered the large at $6.50 + .50 for chilli oil. My co workers got the lunch combo of orange chicken, rice, lomein and wonton chips for $4 (or $5 with a massive egg roll).\n\nMy noodles were over price, and uninspired. A few piece of broccoli was the only veggie of note in it, the MSG was obvious and the chili oil was not even that hot.\n\nMy co worker liked the sides but did not like the chicken.\n\nI was hoping to find a gem in the rough, instead I just found the rough.\n\n\nPS Cash Only!"
"3","I went for an early afternoon trip to the driving range. This is the closest one from my hotel. I decided to play after a bucket. The course was in good condition. Forgiving and flat. Not a lot of challenge except for the greens. They are so sloooow.  $ typical city course.  Lots of public walkers in the course so watch out for errant shots. \nNot bad for a quickie round before sundown!"
"1","Completely disappointed that this course failed to provide notice they were closed. If you are going to be working on the course and the entire facility is going to be unavailable you should consider posting it on your website."
"3","I've eaten here many, many times because it is close to my work and there are very few options within walking distance. Usually I get breakfast on days when I need to get breakfast, because at lunch I have time to drive someplace else. \n\nThe food is usually pretty good and the service OK, too. But I've gotten sick to my stomach on a few occasions as well. If I didn't work close to here, I probably wouldn't return, but as I said options are limited."
"2","--lost its traditional feel through the remodel. where has the personality gone?\n--bulky dark wooden chairs need cushions, the whole place needs more fabric. great potential with lots of light and high ceilings. More bright mexican ceramics please. stark wall of crosses and exposed wood and wrought iron takes me straight to Nathan Lane's Birdcage apartment. LOL.\n--remodel great for small (150ppl) wedding parties with dance floor in the center of the room.\n\n--rice dry and unflavorful, no savor. beans again with no flavor.\n--table salsa is canned tomato sauce with pepper seeds and BASIL and the touch of sugar you get from Ragu! It's salsa, not marinara, people!\n--guacamole has cottage cheese as a thickener! ew!\n--chili colorado is just thick, no flavor.\n--service is slow and unhelpful, but prices are high high.\n--$9 for the cheese crisp is worth it. great crispiness and good cheese blend."
"3","Out to lunch with 5 of my co workers, seated on the patio and served chips and salsa quickly. The salsa was great although several in my party requested one with a bit less heat, go figure. From that point on our service was spotty at best. The appetizer I ordered was forgotten about and was comped by our server ( A Nice Touch ). The entrees arrived and received a mixed review from our group. \n\nA chicken salad that had no dressing ? \n\nA chicken taco salad that also appeared to be missing something, \nsalsa maybe ? The tortilla bowl was limp and soggy. \n\nWhats with the guacamole ? looks like they cut it with sour cream. \n\nAlso, our drinks went unfilled. The server was very rough around the edges, not very knowledgeable and seemed too busy to serve us properly. \n\nOverall. an average experience. My 3 stars is a generous rating for this visit."
"5","The burgers are good and so are the prices. But if you really want to experience The Works skip the restaurant and sit at the bar. Introduce yourself to whoever is sitting next to you and I *guarantee you'll you have an interesting conversation. Unless you're the one who's not interesting.\n\n\n\n*I can't really guarantee anything. Wtf."
"4","The bad: the bar closes at 10pm.  It seems like the western, country, wagon-wheel themed bar that you'd like to close down one night while playing some good tunes on the juke box and eating peanuts.  And also the french fries, file those under bad.\n\nThe good: the hamburgers are pretty much delicious.  Definitely go for guacamole, and add whatever you want from the topping wagon.\n\nI didn't try one myself, but I hear the cookies are good."
"2","Food as always is good.  The Service on the other hand is very unaccomdating.  The girl at the register let us know when we asked if there was a manager available that they were all on vacation.  So I am guessing that customer service is the last thing this place realy cares about.  Because of the rudness."
"1","Stopped in with the fiance and parents for dinner last night.... \n\nWow, in the worst possible way, just wow!\n\nThe food was the same as always... but I would recommend not getting the Small One, burger isn't big enough to get enjoy the flavor. \n\nThe service, if that is what you can call it was horrid! My mouth was agape most of the evening in disbelief. \""Did she just do that?\"" Was pretty much my thinking. First my mothers wine glass was disgustingly dirty, never should have been brought to the table. They when she asked for a new one and pointed out how dirty it was the bartender looked at it like \""Umm looks fine to me..\"" and just wanted away. We watched her put the glass back on the rack with the other \""clean\"" glasses and grab another one. She didn't inspect it to make sure it was clean before handing it off, this one was just as dirty and had lipstick all over it. Me being a bartender asked for a rocks glass, figuring they would be cleaner and less lipstick, she handed me a shot glass. WHATEVER I took it and gave it to my mom. Once she finally came back to the table we pointed out the hideousness of the second wine glass and in the same fashion, probably more irritated, inspected it said \""Okay?!\"" walked back behind that bar and put it back on the shelf. Are you kidding me?!?! Were we being punked? Ridiculous! \n\nLike I said, the food was good, but the service was out outrageous! I hope they read this and get their shit under control. The behavior is unacceptable for a McDonald's. \n\nI am sure we will go back someday, but if she is there, I will leave, if not I will stay but make sure to only order beer in a bottle, no glassware!"
"2","Sometimes you get the uncomfortable feeling in not being welcome there in some parts of the staff is a little bit rude, i I guess you could make the best of it if it was the only place to go, but its not."
"1","Just missed them. They are closed   , I wanted to try the shakes I'll go elsewhere.\nI Stopped by a second time still was not that inpressed but that's just my taste buds maybe you may enjoy it."
"3","Just came for fair food, and it was mediocre at best and waaaaay over priced. For me and my husband to eat 2 beef dogs, fries and 2 sodas was $32. Make sure you eat before coming here. \n\nThe earlier the better but beware the rays of the sun. Parking is cheaper when you come earlier as well. The inside flea market area was pretty cool they had good cinnamon rolls.\n\nIf you come, do it on the weekends before 2 so all you pay is $2 to get in and check it out."
"3","stopped in for a few pizzas with the fam. Pretty good pizza, nice local little spot. we had this pizza with meatballs and pepperoni and a margherita. Both were pretty good. Maybe next time I'll try a sandwich. solid 3 stars"
"5","just fell into this place today and WOW what a gem  GREAT sandwiches  I had the super sicilian and it was fantastic!  great meats  great toasted bread  great cheese and great dressing  wish I had found this place sooner  I will be back to try their pizza which is only served at dinner.  friendly staff and great service   one of only a few great sandwich shops I have found in Phoenix    a MUST TRY!"
"3","Everyone raves about this place, so I tied it. It was just ok. I've had better and worse. I had an Italian sub with chips and a drink. Nothing about the place or sandwich compels me for a return visit."
"3","This ain't no place for one looking for gringoized Mexican food.\n\nThe menu has mostly torats and tacos, what it does not have are chips or many veggie options.\n\nThe inside is surprising nice for the area and type of place.\n\nThe salsa bar is great, with pico de gallo, picante and even a guacamole dip and cabbage.\n\nI had a small cheese quseadilla and it was fine, my co worker had a torta with rice and beans he really enjoyed.\n\nI want to say more but with a lack of non meat options and a Spanish only menu I had a bit of a hard time here.\n\nIf you want a Mexican food adventure and eat meat give it a try."
"2","The trunk space is a semi-good place to see live shows. I have noticed that they seem to follow a strict genre of music. Keeping more to popular-punk but still underground-emo for mostly high school kids, but also like bands that cross this genre with experimental types as well. One thing about the Trunk Space, NO AC!! Damn that place is hotter than a steam room. If you like to be crowded in a small room with emo kids, welcome to the Trunk Space."
"4","It's time to top off the tank before heading back to LA.\n\nThe price on the sign showed $3.69 but when I get to the pump it's $3.64.  SWEET!\n\nOne thing about Phoenix, you can drive 3-4 miles and gas prices from station to station may vary only a few cents, up to 3 or MAYBE 5 cents per gallon regardless of brand,  it's very consistant, unlike LA.    In LA I've driven a mile or two and see prices vary as much as 15 - 20 cents a gallon from one station to another!\n\nQT has a nice decent sized store with plenty of munchies, including REAL food like sandwichws, salads, etc, plus beverages and other snacks.   It's always been clean inside and the staff has always been nice."
"2","I want to give more stars and really like this place.  Service was ok, carne asada tacos pretty good.  Price is cheap.  They have beer.  Nice layout and good location.   All great things but................The place is filthy.  If you can't or won't maintain the dining room and bathrooms then just imagine the kitchen.  We didn't catch them on a bad day either.  What a shame."
"2","I'm Mexican-American, Arizona native-born and raised here.  Excuse me, the owner is Greek origin.  He doesn't really know what \""real\"" Mexican food taste like and the people he hires are \""fly by night\"" cooks.  I've experienced better quality Mexican food elsewhere because here it's not only very expensive, they used the same ingredients in their soups but change meats.  Burritos, combos, appetizers, soups, signature seafood, breakfast combos and burritos are small and too expensive.  It's no wonder nobody notices because most patrons are too drunk to see the price is too high.  Tacos are the only reasonably-priced menu items that are worth having.  There are better authentic Mexican restaurants nearby, such as, Herrera's, Valle de Luna, and original Garcia's on 35th Ave & south of McDowell Rd (with music).  The decorations they have is overwhelming and looks like they are hoarding them but most everyone is too drunk to notice.  They hired girls who dress a bit SLEAZY to get the patrons to buy more drinks.  What happen to this place, the owner got greedy and needs money.  What is with the 3-5 star ratings!  Are you blind!  Oh, yeah and they are now so s-l-o-w, it took them 35 minutes to make two lousy fish tacos.  Who they hired beginner cooks!  And they put up phony food photos, the portions are much smaller.  Any reviews prior to spring of 2013 are way better than after the summer of 2013."
"1","The service is ok but the food is not worth it.  Found a 10 inch strand of hair in my food!! Gross"
"1","I'm sad to do this but I feel betrayed. I brought my 05 Benz in beginning of August. Nothing was done, from what I've seen, but simple body work and they got a check from my insurance for $6,000. I know quite a bit about the auto collision business and everyone knows they cut corners to reduce overhead. Fine with me, but don't give my car back in worse condition than it was before my accident. It's just not right. Too much to write, these guys know exactly what transpired. Thanks for the help Dan, you just pawned me right back off to Brian who could definitely use an assistant. After telling me \""Ill handle this personally\"", I never heard from you again unless I called you directly. Nothing got fixed either. My car pulls to the side of the road and the guys clear coated right over small pebble dings in my hood. Really?? Couldn't have hooked it up with a dab of touch up paint after having my car for 3 MONTHS?? Nice enough people but I lost all respect for this place. They \""sent\"" my car to transmission shop where we had a huge week long miscommunication. Come to find out, it's attached to their building!!!!!! I could have shipped my car home to California and had it done months ago. Instead, I repeatedly believed their stories like my rim getting lost in the mail. Sounds like a delay if game to me. Thanks for nothing guys. Take your business elsewhere."
"3","Stopped back in here tonight & here's an Update since it's been about a year and a half.  I had a regular Whataburger ($2.94) & a small Fries ($1.49).  The dining room was clean & comfortable, the service friendly, & the sizes of the items right for the money.  The burger was well topped, with lettuce, tomato, & diced raw onions, on a warm, toasted bun.  The flavor of the meat was quite ordinary though, & fell well short of the best burgers in town, so it's another 3 Stars for this completely \""ok\"" but not special place.     :-)"
"2","This place serves Werner Enterprises truck drivers. I know cause I'm one of them. It's just the basics for what we need. I've stayed in worse places. So if you like a 5 star hotel, go somewhere else. It's a 2 star maybe a soft 3 star hotel. But there are plenty of food places within walking distance."
"5","Rating is for the breakfast. The American breakfast with toast, eggs, hash browns with a choice of bacon or sausage is sooo delicious. They make it fresh and usually it's a less than 10 minute wait time. Some day I may try one of the lunch/dinner options like the burgers and fries."
"4","The Spring Rolls are a definite must have!  As for the noodle salad it was flavor-able but mainly noodles and greens.  I would love to go back for the soup which is what they specialize in.\n\nI wasn't impressed with the pork, it was too dry for my taste.\n\nIf your in this neighborhood and looking for a new spot.....give'em a chance. \nREMEMBER to bring your cash.....cash only!"
"3","I used to love this place. I have been going there for over 10 years. Lately, the food is not as good. The Pho has little meat compared to others, and they charge extra for meatballs, when they have them. They never have mint, and on more than one occasion I have seen a roach on the wall. I hate to say it, but I stopped going when they started cutting back.I"
"3","This place is unique but definitely not what you think of when you are thinking about getting fish & chips.  Their \""fish\"" are these smallish rectangle patties that are tasty and have fresh fish meat inside.  The chips aren't the \""english style\"" chips you would think of either, but just standard french fries.\n\nTheir sauce is very good and they also offer ketchup for your \""chips\"".  This place has a huge following in the Phoenix area because it has been around for so long but quite honestly not really fish & chips per se."
"2","I must have a foggy college memory because this food simply is not as good as I thought it was when I went to Arizona State.  The fries were bland and tasteless, the shrimp was....I don't even know, and the fish is very much akin to what you would find between two buns and slathered in tartar sauce at a certain drive through with Golden Arches.\nAnd how do people think this is cheap?!  I ordered a kids meal, an adult meal, and an order of chicken tenders to the tune of $19.  That is not cheap!\nThe only joy I found in the bland food is the sauce.  It's apparently a specialty that is only available there.  The sauce is delish, but the sauce really should not be the only source of flavor in a meal, and that is the biggest problem here,"
"4","Very good Mexican food. The server was friendly but seemed overworked. The chips and salsa was excellent. I ordered the machaca chimi and it was very good. Did not come with rice and beans but was enough food itself. I would recommend this to people who want more than chain Mexican food."
"4","Awesome, Awesome, Awesome! WE picked up a Groupon and decided to check this place out. I'm all for a new Mexican restaurant and Rita's did NOT disappoint! It's right off the I-10 at 35th ave, super easy to get to. We started with the table side Guacamole, which was perfect! two HUGE avocados and super fresh chips. The house salsa was also perfect! The next dish we got was the seafood cocktail de molcatejes (sp?) Talk about a humongoid bowl of awesomeness! (See the pic I posted). it was full of shrimp, octopus, scallops and fresh veggies ($20). I went with this mixed grill Plate, that had pork, beef and chicken with griled veggies and peppers! Thsi thing came out still sizzling on a huge platter! Talk about wow factor! Tehy have a seafood version for a few bucks more, definitely a killer dish. All in all, the food  was fantastic, the service was awesome and we'll for sure be back!"
"5","Groupon took us to this restaurant today, we arrived at about 3pm and the restaurant was slow.  Aaron was our waiter and led us to wonderful selections on the menu.  We would rate Rita's salsa pretty close to the best salsa we have ever had!  Aaron was also our bartender and he mixed us up two fabulous margaritas.  We had Parrillada del Rancho for Two for lunch/dinner - the price was very reasonable for the amount of food that was delivered!  The platter had freshly seasoned carne asada, grilled chicken breast and pork chop accompanied by grilled vegetables, served with rice, beans, pico and fresh tortilla's.  No way could we eat it all and we definitely left with full tummy's and a nice to go box!  Plus, we felt this was possibly the best Mexican food we have had in the eight years we have been visiting various Mexican food establishments here in Phoenix.  Bravo Rita's!!  We will be back and we will recommend you to our friends and family."
"4","The wife and I went to Ritas a couple of months ago and let me tell you its gooood. Will come back for sure. O and thanks to Erin that made our time there awesome."
"1","We made a cross country move and had investigated several moving companies.  We chose Beltmann because of their reputation, professionalism with the initial quote and after 2 references gave excellent reports.  We were happy with the quote and the preparation.  \n\nUnfortunately, things went poorly after that.  The day the packers came, they did come on time and finished in the time that we were quoted.  I was initially pleased, but later disappointed as certain boxes were not there for the movers the next day (TV cartons, etc).  When we unpacked, we found some very fragile items carelessly packed.  \n\nWe had also set up the entire move as two parts- one to our new residence as well as storage.  The packers were unaware of this (so did not have two sets of stickers), the movers were unaware as well as the movers at our new location.  \n\nMoving day was extremely bad. Our truck was \""dropped\"" meaning the driver dropped it off in front of our house to work at another site.  We had a 1900 sq foot house, estimated 10,000 lbs and they had only 3 movers.  The lead person had trouble marking our items and coordinating the other two movers.  They almost ran out of tape, had no elastic bands, shrink wrap and were not prepared with mattress cartons. They managed to lose track or not mark parts of anything that was disassembled.  The loading took over 12 hours and was still going on when I left at 9pm.  There was absolutely no correct count on our items (we had things marked with up to 3 stickers and at least 15 items without a sticker)\n\nThe company contact was extremely apologetic and listened to our concerns.  They did mail us a $100 gift card, but for a move that was $8000, it seemed somewhat insignificant.  They later told us they fired the 3 people from that day.  However, we have come to learn that moving people are often \""fired\"" one day and hired back the next.   I asked if they could please make sure there were enough people at our new residence to make it go more quickly.  We were assured there would be.\n\nSadly, a truck breakdown delayed our offload one day past our window, 2 people no-showed for the move and we again had 3 people.  One was the driver who was tired (understandably!) and so it was really 2 movers. Additionally, offload was delayed because NO ONE had the keys to unlock our load.  Only one of three keys was eventually located.  Once opened, the items were shifted and were noted to be clearly poorly packed by the movers here.  The poor marking of things in Phoenix made the unload difficult.  I had brought some hardware with me that did not make it onto the truck, but the rest of the hardware could not be located.\n\nI will say that Beltmann did arrange for a third party to come and assemble what was not assembled the following day.  They were apologetic\n\nIn all, I do think we were a victim of two days where they had an unexpected shortage of people.  However, I think they are completely responsible for not assigning a trained person on our loading day, not responsible for conveying this was a split move (which complicated things on both sides).  It was completely unprofessional to not have keys to the trailer.  As nice as they have been verbally, I would not use this company based on the actions of their movers."
"1","This is the worst dental experience, I have ever had. The receptionist and the dentist were both lacking in basic friendliness..They charged me 224.00, their ad on this web sites shows they charge new patients 39.00 exam and cleaning. it must be the xrays that cost 185.00. While the dentist was cleaning my teeth, he left me waiting in the chair while  he worked on two other patients.  I spent 90 minutes in the dental chair to get xrays and my teeth cleaned. .I let the receptionist know I was unhappy with my experience and ask the dentist to call me so that I could share my experience with him. He must not care about repeat customers... he never called. I called the owner of the company to share my experience. He was going to check into my experience...I never heard from him again either. If your looking for a dentist that doesn't care about customers, this is the right dentist to  spend your money with."
"1","If you are sent here due to a work related injury do more research. While the staff may seem friendly and helpful. Once 5 pm hits its time to go. Sorry if the work is incomplete we can start again tomorrow. I did not see the regular dentist so I can not speak about him. But in any event it us probably best to steer another direction"
"4","Finally had a chance to try this place after a year driving by it. Glad I did! had their Philly Cheese steak. Meat was a good quality sliced very thin. Great taste, people there were very polite. You just need to get their during the off peak hours. When they are busy it's very hard to find parking. But it's still worth it."
"1","I had the pleasure of encountering a faculty that could care less bout their student.\nAll the accolades this faculty received may have been warranted. But during on a one on one session ... this is not the case. Am glad that I've completed my studies here, and no longer have to deal with this inconsistent self-righteous faculty. *whew*\n\nUnfortunately, a faculty like this person, ruins the rep of an ok to good city college."
"3","This is my first time to this Hampton Inn location. The set up is typical of other Hampton Inns. But, the staff is friendly and helpful unlike some other locations I have been to. I arrived before 3 PM and the front desk was able to put me into a room right away without fuss. The room is clean.\n\nI went to the Fitness Center in the late afternoon and discover the fitness closet instead. It was mislabeled as a Fitness Center. It was a small space with three pieces of equipment and a few balls. This fitness closet cannot accommodate more than 4 people at at time. So disappointed."
"5","I figure since I'm on my way over there for an evening of fun filled events,I'd take a moment while my nails are drying to review the joint.\nI like it here.Comfy space,great staff,fun outgoing people.Inside is roomy enough,but the patio is home.They used to have a fire pit that was the ginchiest,but firepits plus  drunky people does not make for happy endings...So they did away with it making even more useable space.It's all good.\nEvery now and again they grill up some burgers that are tasty too.\nSee everyone who's going in a lil bit."
"3","Been here a few times when I'm in town. Last time was during Phoenix Pride (I wasn't aware that pride was going on) The place was packed and lots of friendly people. If you like bears, then pay this place a visit on a Saturday.."
"1","Usually like coming to bunk; however with the recent incidents on several different occasions with the poker leaders and groups. Don't think I will be back on a poker night . Although the bartender did understand our valid concerns I still think the bar needs to have a better appreciation for their loyal patrons that pay full price for their drinks and spend lots off money weekly at the bar.. Should I mention there isn't a happy hour for the after work crew (4p-5p). Most bars have a happy hour 4p-7p, but not bunkhouse.   If I could give 1/2 star or none I would."
"5","I highly recommend Halo and there very professional environment. After a horrible scalpel experience by a piercer in California years ago, I had to have 2 surgeries to reconstruct my ears. I thought there was no hope of ever having them look normal again. I went in to Halo about a year ago to talk to Jeremiah about possibly piercing them one day when the scar tissue healed. You could imagine my hesitation to do anything to my ears again, but as the surgeries left my ears a little uneven I wanted to pierce them with simple studs to take the focus off. So, I finally went in a week ago to see about  piercing them. Jeremiah was very comforting through the whole process and the piercing was quick, precise and just what I had hoped for and more! They are healing better than any piercing I have ever had. I don't have to hide my ears anymore! I have also had a dermal removed there in the past and can honestly say you can trust everyone here. Great place to find some awesome jewelry too. Thanks guys, I will definitely be back!"
"5","Stupid: wanting my nose pierced since I was like 13 years old and putting it off because I was afraid of how bad it would hurt.\n\nStupider: getting five holes in each ear, but not taking the plunge on the nose.\n\nStupidest: finally getting the nerve to do it at the ripe age of 29, only to find out it was less painful than getting my eyebrows waxed.\n\nMy husband came with me the night I finally said f-it and spontaneously drove up the street to Halo to have my teen girl wish come true.  My previous experiences with piercing were at a doctor's office (where my mom took me as a kid), Claire's (gasp!) and of course the Do-It-Yourself Piercing Studio of my college dorm bathroom.  I had no idea what to expect out of a legit piercing place.  Halo impressed me from start to finish, so much so that I'm trying to think of other piercings to get just so I can go back there.  \n\nAna did my piercing and her professionalism was beyond outstanding.  She explained everything very thoroughly, from the sanitation processes they use to after-care and everything in between.  I felt very comfortable with her and confident in her abilities.  Unlike the 20-something piercing gun wielding chick at Claire's or my own unsteady hand, Ana has expertise, skill, and passion for her work.  If you want it done right, go to Ana.\n\nThis place is spotlessly clean.  You watch them wipe down the chair you sit in.  They give you the marker they use to mark where your piercing will go because they won't re-use them.  \n\nThere is a lot of jewelry there, but I like very simple jewelry so I didn't really explore it that much.  I love the diamond and white gold piece for my nose and pretty much never take it out.\n\nThe only thing I would offer as a criticism is it takes way too long to do anything there.  It took forever to get my nose done.  I don't want to rush the process and compromise on cleanliness or quality, but there were little things like the checkout process that I thought could be sped up.  I had the same experience when I went with my husband to get his ears done, and then also when I had to go to replace my nose stud because I lost mine after a night of drunken debauchery.  I guess the thing is, don't go in thinking you're just going to get something done and then head home.  It's like the nail salon.  You're gonna have to spend some time there if you want it done right.\n\nNow that I write this review I've reaalllly got the itch for a new piercing..."
"3","As much as I love this place, I really think I'm twenty years too young to be here. I really love the genres played here and I consider myself pretty well versed in the music. I can't figure out if I'm a young person with a taste for real music, or if everyone who likes real music is older than I. \n\nI showed up on a Friday which is the night when Baddness plays. I think it was them because they played stuff from EW&F, Gap Band, Maze, and bunch of others. No blues that night, just funk. The thing I loved about this band it that I would've expected to see them in an early Jarmusch film like Mystery Train. They were a five or six piece band in all red suits with the lead vocalist in an all red, sequened coat. It was quite possibly the most badass thing I've seen on a music stage in Phoenix. A definite A plus for music and style.\n\nAs far as a blues house goes, I don't really know if I'd consider this one. The Rhythm Room seems to be more up my alley and they seem to have to be a real venue for artists passing through. This definitely seems more like a dive bar/lounge for people who like the music. Again, I really want to come back to this place but I think I should wait a few more years because clearly I should've been born twenty years earlier."
"5","Quite crowded with visitors and very nice music. Awesome!"
"5","Could this be my new favorite bar? You bet!\n\nI've been here twice-both times were SO much fun. I had been wanting to check this place out for a while and quite happy I finally did. It's a gem in central Phoenix. \n\nParking is a bit sketchy--we've been lucky to get a spot in the parking lot, but that was only the first time we went. This past Friday we went and ended up parking in a lot across the street, where there was a man selling ribs straight off the grill. Random, much? \n\nThis place isn't much from the outside, but once inside-it's like you're taking to another realm. It oozes cool without being pretentious. Char's is tiny-I wouldn't be surprised if they were at over capacity on the weekends.\nDespite that, no one seems to be bothered by it being so crowded-I swear every person I encountered was super polite and friendly. I was offered a place to sit at the bar so I could get a drink by a nice gentleman who wanted to just go out and bust a move on the dance floor.\n\nI've been on a Sunday and Friday-both times Soul Power was playing. They ROCK. Usually, I'm like \""meh\"" towards cover bands, but they cover songs and make them all their own. I pretty much was dancing from the time I walked in the door until I left, pausing of course to order a drink. \n\nOverall, a great place for drinks and live music with people from every demographic! If you're a fan of Rhythm Room, you'll probably like this place."
"2","As a follow up to my previous review - the practice manager called me to apologize for the bad experience and remedy the issue.  I appreciate that they took the effort to reach to me after the fact and let me know that they would address the bad experience I had."
"3","Nothing great about this place. Sometimes they have too many employees following you around like a puppy, Sometimes they are short. Today they were just plain unpleasant. No thank you. No apology for their rewards system not working - just a \""you might want to call the number on the card.\"" On top of that, they have some ridiculous card you can buy for 10 dollars, but you get a coupon for 5 dollars, then you get 15% off. Hey guys, don't make it complicated  -just give us a reasonable price and stop stroking us it on ridculous reward systems. BTW Staples brand product sort of suck. So what I'm saying is... if you live in the area and need a pen, go for it. Just don't your hopes up for any more than that."
"5","I get all my business cards printed here.  Great, fast, reliable service!!  Dwight behind the print  counter is the man!"
"3","I live just north of the Burger Factory, its always busy.  The menu offers a little bit of everything, making it a great place to bring an office group with  different tastes.  \n\nThe food portions are large and if your looking for a greasy spoon the burger factory might be your place for a quick bite."
"3","Heaven for vegan . \nStay away from the meat. \nGreat desserts. \nTake the Turkish coffee."
"4","If you want good authentic Chinese food at very reasonable prices, look no further.  Is this place shiny and fancy?  No, but I've been to many a hole in the wall where they serve terrific food.  This place is no exception.\n\nI don't know if I've had a bad dish here.  The selection is large if you know what to order.  Many items are not on the American menu.  The live seafood is awesome and it is cooked to perfection however way you please.  We have also ordered a whole roasted sucking pig here on several occasions for the holidays."
"1","I used to go into this location as a kid, and i loved it. everyone was so nice to me and wouldnt hesitate to offer suggestions to help me improve. one time, they talked me out of buying a new kickstand for my mountain bike because they said it might fall. \nbut more recently, i feel very ripped off every time i go to landis. I was charged 40 bucks for them to install a bike computer(the mounting was already in place) and it took them ten minutes and three zip ties. and even more recently, i went in for brake work, and they said they were going to do an entire brake job and they were going to replace all of the brake cable housings. when i got it back, i realized that they had only replaced two of them, but bumped up to cost of each so it was still the same ammount of money. \n\nit is sad that this place is now about profit versus genuine customer service, and for that reason, i will be taking my bike elsewhere, (slippery pig, etc)"
"4","I was immediately approached when i arrived at the store and they asked me if i needed any help in particular. I said no i was just browsing and they told me to come ask them if i need help with anything... the usual customer service thing.\n\nThere was great selection here at the store, a wide variety of types of bikes you got the a small selection of cruiser and hipster bikes. a pretty solid option for hybrids and commuters. large selections for road, cyclocross, tri, mtb (dh and xc). I purchased a new seat when i was there, very fair pricing, not sure about their in shop/labor pricing didn't ask because it is way too far for me to bring my bike to just for some work. The workers are very knowledgeable in their stuff as i heard them talking to other people who needed specific help with things.\n\nI enjoyed this store, not as big of a selection for bars as i thought, seat selection is small but priced well. \n\nThey have lots of bontrager and trek brand stuff there, so if you love those brands head on over.\n\nThey have lots of information about races and riding information on their brochure stand."
"1","Took my girlfriend in to buy a bike here.  While the purchase was smooth, we also decided to upgrade some of the components while we were there.  Both items were paid for but had to be ordered.  The guys ended up only delivering on one of the items and then gave us the run around every time we called on the second item.  Won't be back in..."
"1","Beware. They do not practice proper procedures and will end up serving you food melted THROUGH the styrofoam containers. On top of that their customer service will leave you being laughed at and scowled upon, on top of them talking shit because they think you don't know spanish right in front of you.  All when you demand food that does not have cancerous plastic melted into it. A fresh order and an apology is how you handle it. Not sending them back home after a second trip with  cold food and not a difference in how they packaged it . After what my husband saw them doing while cooking the food as he waited, I assure a call to the health department about sanitation and cross contamination.  As regular patrons we will no longer go there. You should seriously reconsider the etiquette of your little taco stand people."
"5","My favorite store!\nVery pricey even with a student discount\nI've learned 2 pretend 2 be a AI student and get my Windsors there @ the AI student store along with prismas. AI student store is cheap on culinary kits as well & Aaron brothers has better quality brushes"
"4","Sunday afternoon before heading back to the airport was great. Jack & I met some really nice guys. Good mix of people and the tacos were good and cheap. Fun place!"
"2","A PERFECT marriage between Party On & Bottom Of the Barrel.  First experience here reminded me of what happens to us all after a few too many to drink.  A friend wanted to show me out and suggested this location to end the night after 2a.m. Lets just say the cab didn't get far before I got back in.  It was a mix of 'clicks' still dancing the night away surrounded by the hopefuls and out of shape-late 40 something's preparing to pounce at the first sight of a wounded gazelle.  Looks like I better try this place out once more under different circumstances as the previous reviews show it may have  potential."
"2","Ew, never again."
"2","I went in yesterday for my 1st ever eye exam. Yeah, I know that's pretty bad since I'm 27 and stare at computer monitors all day long for a living but hey you're not my mother so quit judging me. Geez. Back to my review :)\n\nI made an appointment with Prime Eye Care about three weeks ago. Bringing me to disappointment #1: I received no reminder call saying \""Hey your appt is tomorrow, blah blah blah\"". Now I know it's MY appointment and they may have been busy but isn't it sort of the front desk persons job to call patients and remind them of scheduled appointments. Not such a big deal though. So, moving on.\n\nDisappointment #2: The doctor had NO people skills at all. He just wanted to get this over with. I told him this was my 1st ever eye exam you'd think he'd at least let me know what's going on before sticking this and that in my eye. But no. All I got was a sit still, open your eyes, look up. I mean come on dude YOU'RE STICKING A FREAKIN LIGHT IN MY EYE. At least give a girl a heads up and all. It just would have been nice to have a little warning like \""Hey, I'm going to have you look all over the place while I stick this uncomfortable rather bright light in your eye, do your best to stay as still as possible and keep your eyes open\"". But no I received nothing of the sort.\n\nThen he puts these drops in my eyes and has me sit out in the waiting room. I had no idea why, so as I'm sitting there and my eyes begin to feel more and more awkward, I start to freak out a little. \""Is this whats suppose to happen? Why can't I see? Oh no something's wrong\"". After being ushered to another exam room I come to find out that all that is normal, it's actually what was expected to happen. Thanks for the HEADS UP DOC. So then the doc comes back in with another damn light to stick in my eyes. Then he rambles off all this technical eye jargon that pretty much left me with a big fat \""HUH\"". But I think I got the gist of it.\n\nSo now brings me to the disappointment #3 (the big one): I go to the front desk, pay my copay, no big deal then the front desk gentleman asked me if I had sunglasses, to which my reply was yes in the car. That was it. Nothing else. I had NO IDEA until I stepped out into the Arizona sun, scratch that the Arizona HOT BRIGHT AS HELL sun, to figure out why the gentleman asked me if I has sunglasses. Oh my god! A little warning that it was going to feel and look as though I was WALKING ON THE SUN would have been nice. I mean come on people! I couldn't see a damn thing until I got all the way back to my car and put my sunglasses on. My eyes were dilated for the next few hours, which would have also been nice to have been told about. I wouldn't have tried to go back to work had I know that little tid bit of info.\n\nI gave a two because all in all, I got my eye exam over with so that was good. The doctor seemed like he knew what he was doing, so that was good. The office itself was rather nice looking. And I'm in a good mood this morning. I'm just used to a more friendly office visit. I wish they would have just talked to me is all. Is that too much to ask for?"
"3","You order at the counter here, & when your order is ready you take it to your choice of several quaint little dining rooms, or the mostly enclosed, covered patio.\n\nI ordered the #C Weekday Lunch Combo, which brought out a shredded beef taco, a cheese enchilada, a green burrito, beans & rice, plus a side of chips, sold separately.\n\nThere were no booths, the portions of food were smallish, served on picnic plates, & the chips were very ordinary.  SO, 2-Stars & we're out of here, right?  ...Well, not so fast!\n\nThe excellent salsa helped the chips along, & what you get along with the modest meal size is a reasonable price ($5.95 + .50 for the chips).  Oh, & the taste of the food overall was TERRIFIC!  That's one thing, isn't it?    :-))"
"5","love! always a favorite!"
"4","Nice sized parking lot. Friendly staff."
"4","There may be other breakfast places that are more unique, have better individual menu items, or are more compelling for one reason or another. But over the years, this place has consistently provided great healthy meals and excellent, fast, friendly service. I have never had a bad experience here and have always left wondering why I don't come back here more often. Then I go and try some new trendy breakfast joint, only to realize I would have been better off coming back to First Watch instead. My personal favorite dish is the Chickichanga, but I've eaten half the stuff on the menu and it's all been really good. And I particularly enjoy the fact that no matter what I eat there, I never feel like I just ingested 9lbs of cheese and grease when I'm done. It's all light and healthy and fantastic."
"3","Mary Coyle is some pretty good ice cream. i would write a longer review, but the history has been covered, and the atmosphere. \n\ni would like this place more, but purchasing ice cream to go afew times i have noticed i need to let it thaw for a month before i can actually eat it. it's frozen that hard. other then that this place is pretty cool. :P"
"1","It's always surprising to find yourself on the wrong side of the zeitgeist.  Such is my experience with Mary Coyle.  I've gone to MC several times over the last couple of months and only one time could I bring myself to actually sit down.  The place is filthy.  On top of that unpleasantry the bus staff is likely to be found smoking in the back parking lot while un-bussed tables piled with half eaten sundays and used napkins run amok.  The last two times I visited there was a strong and very obvious sewer issue.  How people can eat here is beyond me.  Maybe I was just unlucky and my three experiences were not the norm.  I certainly hope so but I can't bring myself to give them a fourth chance."
"2","Decided to run through the drive thru....first mistake.  The poor girl working the window was unfamiliar with the menu.  After she finally handed the menu to me, I was able to point to what I wanted.  Ordered.  Was asked to pull ahead.  After a wait...it finally came. \n\nDrove off....time to head home....with shear anticipation.  \n\nOn the drive home I could smell onion rings.  Unable to figure out what it was...until I got home.  It was my bag of ice cream.  The bag and all of the containers smelled of grease.  And...the flavor came through to the ice cream.  No bueno!\n\nWhat was salvageable of the ice cream was so icky sweet.  Had to stop, for fear of a diabetic coma.  And quickly down water.  \n\nMeh...never again."
"4","Look, don't try and count any calories here, you'll simply just be wasting time that could better be spent savoring one of lifes best & most plesureable sins!!! Thank God it's right here in good'Ol Phx, Az. If you like and I mean LOVE, high fat rich & creamy ice cream churned to order? Then run don't walk, a speeding ticket may be worth it for one of those super malts w/the harder little scoup at the bottom of the cup!!! OR even one of those pints 2-GO!!! Be right back....time for an Ice cream break!"
"1","Disappointing.. I had out of town guests visiting, and we wanted some ice cream after our dinner. We were in the general area, and I had heard so many good things about Mary Coyles, that I suggested we try it out. My friends were impressed with the appearance of the place when we got there. It was about 815pm on Sunday night. The place was reasonably busy. After looking at the menues, We decided on a \""Peak\"" which was listed as three flavors of ice cream with three different sauces for each scoop, and a simple sundae of Peppermint Bark Icecream with hot fudge. \n\nAfter waiting quite a while, our ice cream arrived. First shock--the Peak came in a tumbler, not in a boat or bowl. so it was three scoops of icecream (all different flavors) on top of one another, with the sauces all mixed in. To make matters worse, it was melted, so more like a milkshake instead of sundae. My peppermint bark sundae was also melted and mushy.  The three of us ate maybe half of the sundaes. When the waitress came around to check on us, we let her know that we were disapointed in both the presentation of the Peak, and the fact that both items were melty and runny. She offered to have them remade, but by this time, we just wanted to leave. She presented the bill with a 10% discount.. Woopty doo...No visit from a manager, no offer to take care of us next time... just a \""here is your $1.25 off\"". So we ended up paying something like $12 for two runny, melted dishes (glasses really) of ice cream."
"2","I had a waffle cone with a scoop of peanut butter cup and a scoop of rocky road. The ice cream wasn't great; the flavors seemed off, and the texture was grainy. The cone was flavorless and fell apart before I finished the first scoop. For the price, it didn't really seem worth it."
"5","I'm heart broken to find out that this place has closed down. I am now an adult and grew up going to Mary Coyles. I had so many fond memories of going there with my previous church. Best ice cream. Hopefully another will come around. Just sucks the location closed down. I'm very displeased to know this. Very displeased. I hope whoever allowed Mary Coyles close down knows that it should go back to business. I'm not happy about it."
"1","I gave this place a try two times. Both times I've been very disappointed  on the quality if the food and their extremely slow service. The food made my tummy ache all day after I returned back to the office. \nUnfortunately I will no longer return. Sorry la Paloma, I really wanted this to be my near neighborhood Mexican spot"
"2","Well I wouldn't really call this place a \""cocktail lounge\"" like sayyyy Side Bar but to me it was more like a very well lit pool hall. Even though there was no smoking inside it was hekka smokey in this place. I am guessing this place is 21+ thats why people like it oh and cheap drinks!?!?! I'm not sure but this place KIND of reminds me of River City Pockets with less pool tables?? If this was like the only option available I'd go if you made me, cuz you cant fool me twice. I'd rather just sit home and drink myself to sleep."
"1","Remember in the 90s when Kyoto Bowl was good and you could page your friend, he'd call you and you could ask him to stop by the Blockbuster to pick up Terminator II swing by the Kyoto Bowl and grab you a Teriyaki Bowl?  \n\nThen that dude stole your girlfriend, you got an iPhone, Blockbuster closes virtually every store around, and Kyoto Bowl started serving awful food that smells like bile in a bowl.  \n\nAt least you still have Terminator II.....now on DVD with bonus features.  \n\nIf you're tempted to re-live the 90's at the Kyoto Bowl, just play some Pearl Jam and grow your goatee out instead.  You'll be happy you did."
"5","A liquor where you can actually go in and talk about the liquor.  The guys know what they are selling and have a lot of cool stuff.  My uncle has been looking for Arak and Ouzo.  I know where I can find them in California but had no idea where to find it in AZ.  Stopped at every liquor store along my five mile drive and not only did these guys have know what I was talking about, they had it.  Bought both bottles and was happily on my way.  Now I have a go to spot for unique liquor in AZ.\n\nAlso, it helps a lot when the place is clean and not full of guys buying $1 cans of beer and single cigarettes.  Definitely one of the best liquors stores I've been in anywhere.  Keep up the good work guys."
"5","Another fabulous home style Chinese food at The Prime Chinese...... If you like combo fried rice, it is the best ever...."
"5","This restaurant is a master of understatement. From the outside and Upon entering, it doesn't look like much. \nAs it should be, the truth is in the food  food....best beef and broccoli I've ever had.  We are regulars now.  Simply outstanding"
"4","I've had pets my whole life and my observation has been that when the 's front desk staff is nice and proffesional , the doctors are not and when the doctors are great, the front desk leaves much to be desired.  This was not the case at Alta Vista.  First off, there hours are great.  Secondly. the front desk people (Sam), the techs and the doctor (Dr. Sean Penn), very friendly and courteous.  And finally, the price was reasonable. That, along with the place being clean and not smelling like wet dog when you walk in made having to take my dog in on a Sunday afternoon as pleasant as could be.  So far so good."
"2","I have to say I went to this location because of their hours and for the Yelp reviews I read.  I had set an appointment and when I got there only one other person was out in the waiting area. I walked right to the counter and was asked to fill out some papers which was expected since it was my first time.\n\nI finished the papers in less than 5 minutes and then I sat in the lobby for 30-35 minutes. Another woman walked in and told the lady at the counter she wanted to bring her dog in because he was acting strange. Her words \""He was going up to a friend and wanting to be pet by him, he must be sick because he is shy\"" and then she got brought back with her pet!  I was already sitting there a good 15 minutes, REALLY?\n\n I was getting a bit upset because, well, I don't have all the time in the world and just wanted to get my 2 dogs looked at.\nAfter 30 minutes I finally walked up to the counter and said \""You do know I had an appointment at 11, right?\"" \n\nFinally they brought me back to the examination room...I sat there for another 30 minutes! I couldn't believe it. My blood was boiling and I was to the point where I started to put my dogs back in the kennel to leave.  As I was packing them up  a tech came in to start off the temp and weight. She was very friendly and the reason why I gave more than one star.\nThe tech did her thing and left...and there I was sitting waiting for the vet for another 10 minutes!\n\nHere I am 70 minutes after my appointment and still have NOT seen the vet, I missed another appointment I had because of how long it took.\n\nWhen setting up the appointment for the next visit I wasn't given an card or anything to remind me of when it is. I have no idea when the next appointment is, I may have missed it but that doesn't matter, I don't plan on returning.\n\nI did get a call the next day about the stool but they weren't sure if the samples had been mixed up because the adult dog had parasites that a puppy would have and the puppy had some that the dog should have so they just generally treated them both.\n\nWhen I went to pick up the medicine the person at the counter couldn't tell me what I needed to do to give 1 mil of the medicine to the puppy. Another tech happily assisted me and gave me a syringe, thankfully she was there. \n\nWhen I asked the guy at the counter what kind of parasites I was battling the guy said \""I don't know\""... I asked if it was in their records and he said \""No\""...wait...what???? So I stood there thinking he was finding out for me...no, he was doing something else...I took the medicine and they didn't even say \""Make sure when you're done you bring a sample back in to find out if they are better\"" It has been a week since the 7 day medicine ran out and I haven't got a call asking if all was OK and if I'm going to bring in the stool samples.\n\nI really don't feel comfortable with this place, and I'm upset that it didn't work out....I had better hopes to find a vet in the neighborhood since I'm new to it.\n\nTime to find a new one. If anyone has found something in the area that's you went to, please let me know by message."
"5","It was a first time I had to take one of my pups to the hospital and it was extremely serious. The staff and doc took great care of my little one and was awesome about communicating everything to us. The doc was great about personally calling and then also following up 2 weeks after. I would recommend taking your animal here."
"1","No contest this is the worst apartment i've ever lived in! i have no heat, my drains make a strange and loud gurgling noise whenever my upstairs neighbors or myself flush our toilets. my faucets are constantly leaking even after they've been fixed. the community has dog poop everywhere, i can hear every noise the people above me make. \n\nManagement will try to get extra money from you anyway they can. i tried to drop off my rent check today but they closed early. it wouldve been nice if they had made even the smallest effort to tell their residents what time they would be closing, but no they didnt do that. this way they can get extra money into their greedy hands by being able to charge their residents late fees!! it works out perfect for them. Even if you do pay your rent on time you will still get notices saying that your rent was late. the fact anyone would stay here longer than 1 lease term is beyond me. im counting the days till i can move out!! if you are thinking of renting here PLEASE DON'T! you will be disappointed from the first day."
"3","Mi Patio without a Patio?  This gives you a hint of what is about to happen.\n\nThe interior is modest and Patio\""est\"".  Patio type tables and chairs with Terra Cotta tiled floors and Mexican influenced tchotchke decorations.  Promptly upon seating, a silver bowl full of chips and a side of salsa arrives.  Things are looking up.\n\nNext, time to order a drink or 10.  My first thought is how many places serve a small Margarita for $1.75 and  a large for $3.25?  I am not sure who did the business plan for this place, but generally bars do not use drinks as the loss leader. Shh, don't tell anyone OK?  The large was a healthy size and I am surprised it did not come with a beta fish, so I had two !\n\nSipping on cheap margaritas helped wash down the somewhat stale tasting chips.  Maybe I am just use to super crisp chips, but the salsa did help with the overall experience.\n\nI ordered the two chicken taco combo with rice and beans ( I always order with double rice and no beans and they accommodated that).  I have to admit, the chicken tacos were stuffed like a Thanksgiving turkey with plenty of chicken, cheese and lettuce.  I was happy with this result and could barely finish.\n\nOverall a good meal, a very solid showing for the patio-less patio place."
"5","Best chips anywhere, great decor, prime corner location, and no one else has their specialties. XLNT!"
"4","Stopped in for lunch today, it was fantastic!  I had the spinach and feta chimi because as a vegetarian I don't find a lot of meat free chimis out there.  This alone will bring me back to this place!  I am also anxious to try their other veg options.  Service was friendly and quick, price was great.  We had 3 entries and a kids meal for about $40 before tip. \n\nSalsa is fantastic, but if you don't like a little zip or are sensitive to spice you might want to skip it.  I loved it though."
"5","This is my fav Mexican spot. It's authentic, a great value, and the food always tastes amazing. I have always had great service and the staff is very welcoming. The chips and salsa are among best I've had and be sure to try green sauce if you get enchiladas."
"2","This restaurant keeps you loaded with good chips & salsa. Guacamole is also good. The rest of the restaurant experience is horrible. Took a while for us to be noticed just to be seated, then took almost 30 minutes to place our order. The restaurant wasn't even full. Only 2 other tables when we walked in. Service was not attentive in the least. The food was below average. Soft drinks were flat. If we lived in the area, we wouldn't go back."
"3","Really fun place! Great atmosphere and great food awesome parrots and cool crap everywhere decorated"
"1","So disappointed! We used to live not far and remembered it fondly, but returned w our family recently (daughter and two well-behaved teens) and could hardly get out quick enough. In a town with plenty of quality Mexican restaurants, this was our sad experience: stale chips, sooo sweet margaritas from a commercial mix, \""char-broiled taquito\"" consisted of soggy tortilla and steamy meat that had not recently experienced any charbroiling, shared fajitas churned out with no caramelizing or evidence of time on a plancha, essentially hot meat and vegetables w two tiny tortillas.  What happened to the old Mi Patio? Maybe it doesn't exist at 6 on Friday nights.\n\nWhile I can't exactly fault the restaurant for our being trapped next to a raucous group of nine people at a table sized for six (they kept pulling up another chair \""Sure, we can make room\""), I do think well-run restaurants are attentive to the realities of maneuvering around with hot plates when tables are overfilled. That's on the end of server experience; as for diner experience, at one point, two of us had hand over an ear to soften the donkey-loud laugh of the woman next to us. Maybe it was amplified by the tunnel-like area near the back door, which we used to escape as soon as we popped cash (and a tip-it's hardly fair to punish the server) in the folder. \n\nOur server was pleasant and efficient, I'll give them that, but do lament $80 and 80 minutes of my life wasted."
"2","After our first choice for Pizza turned out to be unfortunately very closed, we decided to head up the street to give this place a shot.  Possibly because it is located a couple miles down the street, this place always seems to be mentioned along with Pizza A Metro, so obviously I was more than willing to give Pino's a shot.\n\nWhat unfolded was a very average experience.  None of the pies looked particularly interesting; I went with the vegetarian.  It was basically a step above a Barro's supreme pizza as far as toppings are concerned.  The crust was better than what you would get at a pizza chain, but it was a little harder than it should be, and somewhat lacking in flavor.\n\nNothing seems particularly bad, just underwhelming.  Not to mention, it cost almost $20 for a pizza and a drink.  A little steep for that neighborhood, I think.\n\nIt's really difficult to justify ever going back here when Pizza A Metro is just down the street."
"2","My husband and I used to frequent this place whenever we felt like going out to dinner. The pizza isn't the best in town, but we were fond of the service and neighborhood-y atmosphere (friendly, casual). The last 4 times we've been there over the past few months, the service has been actually awful. \n\nOnce we had a new waitress, who said it was her first day as a waitress, for which I felt bad because...why wasn't anyone training her?! Last time, the waitress was actually rude, and barely checked on us, even though we would have ordered more if she had. Her loss, Pino's loss.\n\nUsed to feel like an old friend. Sadly, no more. Not sure we'll ever go back, because you want to feel welcome when you frequent a place.\n\nIf you do go, I recommend a plain cheese or quattro fromaggi pizza or the lasagna, which is often on special. \n\nOh, they used to serve budweiser (regular, not light) in frosted glasses, and there was something old fashioned and delicious in it, but they don't seem to do that anymore either. \n\nThere is also one great Italian waiter, but we never get him anymore. I guess we're not good enough to get real waiters?? Ha."
"5","Very knowledgeable and helpful. I went in for a surety bond and he made it very easy and even provided useful tips to help me out. Definitely going to be getting insurance here when my policy is close to an end."
"5","Ok, I probably shouldn't do it, but I have to put in a review for this place.  Now, the last time I was here was back in 2001, but damn, Yelp wasn't around, and I just have to Yelp a place unique like this (besides, one of my Yelp Friends just Yelped this place and jogged my memories about this Native goodness).  \n\nSo yeah, if you're in between pow wows and have a fix for some fry bread, this is the place to go.  I remember having some fry bread here and it tasted excellent.  I also remember totally loving the soups/stews as well.  There are not that many Native restaurants around, so give this one some props!\n\nShiiiiiiiiiiiiii.  I think I need to plan a trip to Phoenix this very minute, innit?!  \n\nAieee!!!!"
"3","I wouldn't advise any health nut go here but if you want some cheap super yummy HUGE taco's with frybread wrappers?   Hit it up!\n\nThe ladies working were really nice and the price was pretty fair.\n\nI felt like a peace pipe afterwards... no really... okay no I didn't but it was really good."
"2","First ever experience with Indian food and definitely NOT a fan.\n\nExterior definitely looked like a house as their name calls for. A tad bit worn both interior and exterior. Furnitures were simply cafeteria like tables and you order at the counter paying upfront.\n\nTheir # 1 rave after hominy stew was a must try so I did so and for sure there will be a no second time. Blindfold me and I would've never been able to tell if this was homemade or out of a Progress/Campbells can. Stew definitely had sufficient ingredient but simply lacks flavor. Abundant amount of hominy in every spoon but does not suit my palate at all. Protein was tough and soup tasted run down. \n\nFried bread reminds me of chinese donuts served for breakfast except a tad bit more doughy and is flattened to a circular shape. The bread itself is a great foundation for both entree and dessert if all ingredients were done right. I ordered a taco and a dessert (all utilizes fried bread) and was devasted with the ingredient used. The chocolate butter dessert was simply a cup full of butter poured over a cup of chocolate syrup. NOt to mention that the bread was already deep fried. Enough grease where a pack of oil absorbant sheet can't even save. Flavor was just like how it sounded. \n\nTaco itself was ground meat, refried bean, lettuce and cheese. Definitely tasted like something you can get at a taco bell/ Del Taco. No special marination nor seasoning done. \n\nI guess if i'm ever craving fried bread itself and if I\""m by the area..which will never be..I'd probably pick one up and slap something on there myself. However it wasn't all that unique to me since Chinese cuisine carries close to identical \""fried bread' they make.\n\nPlentiful parking. Poor service since I was turned down for needing an extra set of utensils.\n\n-Susan"
"4","I would have probably given this 3 stars if not for the awesome green chili stew and the variety of dessert frybreads that rock my world.\n\nThe various frybread tacos are solid, but nothing that exceptional. I like the chorizo one with lots of hot sauce. \n\nIt's a good neighborhood spot when you're in the mood for something a little different, or especially if you've got a sweet tooth! :)"
"3","I enjoyed the Fry Bread as the bread itself was very delicious especially when topped with beans and cheese with the bread being an above average size.  Prices have gone up as a Fry Bread with bean and cheese will run you $6.28 after taxes and if you want to add a drink to that you can count on at least another $2.00.\n\nFor me the price isn't worth coming back on a regular basis.  The beans didn't have much taste but you can add salt and salsa to your bread if you want to add more taste.\n\nOverall, if you are in the mood for some fry bread this is a good place to get a quick fix.  Although, I would have to say that the fry bread sold annually at the State Fair taste much better.\n\nSpecial note, they have a child's size fry bread with bean and cheese with a drink for $3.95 plus tax.  Interestingly, the child's size is not too much smaller than the full size.  \n\nSo if you want to save some $$$ you can always order take out and get the child's size fry bread !"
"2","Saw owner wipe the tops of the red ketchup bottles with the same rag he used to clean the table. Won't go back."
"2","The fry bread is good, but it is overpriced and the service is Horrible!  The fact that they gave a Giant Tip jar is hilarious, since they just take your money and call out your name when it's ready.   I guess you're tipping for the indifferent service that is border line rude and obnoxious.  Won't be going back."
"5","Hi, Nathan, thank you so much for talking to me today about the avalibility new location in South Scottsdale. I've been to your restaurant several times and I'm excited for the possibility of you aquiring the space next door to my barbershop. I've been on this corner for over 40 years, with a senior center across the street, the General Dynamics Research Plant on the other side, and the Salt River Indian Reservation on the East side. Including the densely populated neighborhood. It is sure to be a winner.\n- Benny Guerra\n480-874-3456\n\nP.S. It is a great location!"
"5","When my husband was diagnosed with a brain tumor in March of 2010, our family doctors recommended Barrow to do the surgery to have it removed. We initially had an appointment with a different doctor, but because of scheduling conflicts we ended up going with doctor Alan Mitha, who is the fellow for Dr. Robert Spetzler. \n\nDr. Mitha was very knowledgeable about the procedure and kindly answered any questions or concerns we had about the surgery. He explained what the surgery would be like, complications that might arise from the surgery, and recovery time. We had my husbands operation set for May of 2010. The entire surgery took about 8 hours but we were kept updated through the entire process. Doctors would come out periodically and explain what was going on and how my husband was doing. When the surgery was completed both doctors came out to explain the entire thing to us. \n\nWe were very lucky to have been able to be in the state of one of the best neurosurgeons in the country. All of the doctors were very kind and understanding about how scared we both were and took their time making us feel comfortable. I highly recommend any of the doctors at this facility."
"5","Been going here for almost a decade.  Never had any problems.  Very affordable, speedy cleaning and I don't have that funky after-drycleaning stiff feeling you'd normally get at these cheap $2.29 cleaners.  (You know what I'm talkin' about)  \n\nThey really do a great job and don't damage your clothes by putting stickers on your clothes like they do at the \""organic drycleaners\"".  Just a safety pin with a piece of paper on the clothing label. \n\nThey only accept cash or checks. Worse case scenario, you can use the ATM they have inside their store."
"3","The review that says they charge $1.25 to have any item dry-cleaned is incorrect. They charge $2.50 per item. I like their prices, but I was not impressed with how they ironed my suit pants when I got them cleaned. They came back with double creases in some places and random wrinkles in the knees and legs. I had to re-iron them myself. I'm going to try American cleaners a little more south on 7th Ave. to see which is better.\n\nI do like that they are open late until 7 PM though."
"4","$2.50 per item and if you drop-off before 9:00 am your stuff will be done by 4:00 pm.\n\nGood basic dry cleaner that doesn't charge you an arm and a leg just to get your clothes cleaned and pressed.\n\nCash only - but if you forget they have an ATM in the lobby.\n\nRecommended."
"3","The key to Sack's is the daily specials. \n\nFor a long time I came here and got the Symphony which is a decent turkey/avacado sandwich and some oriental noodles or one of their other eclectic, tasty sides. Or I would get one of the hot sandwiches on a sub roll like the Encore sans ham. The sandwiches here are ok, but kindof of soggy and sloppy with only mediocre bread like the Baggin's chain in Tucson.\n\nOne of my workmate's finally showed me the light in the form of the poorly written scribbles on the white board at the far side of the menu. Pretty much everything I've ordered from it has been fantastic. The bread still isn't much to talk about, but the unique sandwiches it sports like \""The Blues\"", which is some delicious cajun chicken concoction, make me wish I could eat two.\n\nTop it off with some of their great iced teas. They usually have a couple flavors, with the fruity/citrusy ones being the best. Make sure not to pour a full cup of the Market Spice tea though, you might choke to death. It's best mixed with other teas."
"3","I always get the Chicken Salad here so I can't comment on the other types of sandwiches that they have. The Chicken Salad is good but not Cassella's great. (check previous review on Cassellas) They used to have the best cookies here but today's was a bit overcooked. Still good but not as chewy goody as always. The place is too small and was very crowded ( no place to sit for me today) and the service tends to not be very good.While they are fast I don't find the staff very friendly.  It is also on the high end expensive for just a sandwich. I go every now and again when in the neighborhood because I love good sandwiches. I would say better than average but nothing to write home about. Also, a tip- go on off lunch hours."
"1","After numerous attempts to resolve and promises to refund prepayment,  and no apology, my money was refunded.......two months later. Thanks Hertz for ensuring my entire experience was poor. Back in Phoenix this month, going straight to enterprise!"
"4","Great place to go on a Monday afternoon. There were probably less than 20 cars in the parking lot. I was kind of leery at first because the mall here is sketchy at best, but this was a nice clean theater with friendly staff."
"4","After craving Chinese food and checking Yelp for someplace close to home, we decided to try Maxim since it has had such great reviews. And, like most of the time, my fellow yelpers were right on.\nMaxim serves both Vietnamese and Chinese food. The majority of the menu is Vietnamese, like Pho and the vermicelli noodle dishes, and they have Chinese food for lunch specials, like Kung Pao chicken. \nI got a bowl of the Pho, which was big enough to swim in, and my girlfriend got one of the vermicelli noodle dishes, which could have fed us both, and we shared hot tea. Our meals and drinks were $12. The food was good, the service was great and the portions are huge! We have at least another meals worth of leftovers.\nSo if you like Asian food and are looking for a good meal for a great price, check out Maxim. You will be happy and full - Pho Yeah!"
"5","Feeling yucky one day and wanting nothing but some reminders of my bay area asian food... My search began with my iPhone for Pho.. AND I wanted good Pho.. (Im skeptical of some dishes in the desert, just sayin'!).. I drove a good 20min from my loft to find this place.. worth it. Usual toppings you will find with real Vietnamese Pho.. but awesome! I asked for a variety of tofu and seafood.. I couldnt finish it all.. but never can with Pho.. its a big bowl, and filling! \nExtras on tables to get your Pho on.. \nOrdered the Vietnamese Shrimp Rolls too.. left feeling not so stuffy! AND full.. OH yeah, and I still had money for a bit of shoe shopping the next day... :-)"
"5","After flying across the country we were hungry and as I've done in many other cities, I went in search of pho.  \n\nI ordered the pho dac biet.  The broth was not oily, and packed with flavor.  The noodles were just right and there was a generous amount of tripe and tendon."
"4","Great pho, the broth is so delicious and a great big portion.  Try the rolls too, they do it right!\n\nBeen here on a couple of occassions since it's a far drive, but a great place to stop by for some great food.\n\nTried a few different items when dining with a group recently. Enough for everyone to share and even took some leftovers.\n\nEven though they were close to closing time, they allowed us and some other folks in.  Great people."
"5","Great food...friendly service...and very reasonable!  Try some of their fresh lemonade instead of BYOB."
"3","Pepe's is everything you would expect of a local non-chain mexican restaurant. Warm chips, good salsa, local waiters, good dishes, mediocre sides, and a south-of-the-border decor. I visited for lunch on a Wednesday and had no problem being immediately seated. We each had one of the lunch special dishes: burrito with red sauce, enchiladas with red sauce, and a chimichanga with red sauce - all with rice & beans.  Let me say that the chips and salsa were the highlight of the meal. Although it was good enough that i would go back to try a Mexican Pizza or a dish of chicken mole."
"2","Came here for some pho and spring rolls after hearing this place recommended by some co-workers.  Definitely will not be going back.\n\nDrove up and the place looked completely run-down from the outside.  No problems, I'm cool with that, I've certainly climbed into my fair share of the hole-in-the-wall restaurants in San Francisco and Hong Kong.  The places that look like their housing criminals but you can't help but forgive it because the food is oh-so-good.  \n\nToo bad Da Vang wasn't like that.  The table wasn't cleaned properly and there were what looked like dried hoi sin sauce on the table.  I had to go through 3 spoons before I found one that didn't have dried food particles clinging to it and then another 5 to find a clean one for my girlfriend.  That is just completely wrong.  Utensils should be clean-not having the last guy's lunch still clinging to it!\n\nI was really hoping the food was good.  I told myself if the food was good I can live with it.  The portion was freaking huge on the XL special pho bowl but half way through the meal I realized it was mostly noodles.  The meat was less than most places and the broth was only so-so in taste. \n\nHole in the walls are usually the best kept secrets, unfortunately Da Vang didn't have the cleanliness or the taste to keep me coming back."
"2","Da Vang (pronounced yah yang) is a hole in the wall in a sketchy ass strip mall next to the latin strip club and the Vietnamese Boba Tea shop. Weeknights and Weekends alike, this place is packed to the gills with Asian families, Mexicans from the neighborhood, and the few rogue gays and hipsters who wander in to try something ironic or obscure. Then you have the old Mexican ladies who walk by every table and put a car air freshener on it with a note explaining that you can buy it from her for $1. There are countless flies, the place hasn't been cleaned since Jesus was alive, and the parking lot almost requires four wheel drive. There isn't a more third-world dining experience in Phoenix.\n\nMy initial inpression was that this would be a fantastic trip to a Vietnamese wonderland. Seeing the types of people eating here, the extensiveness of the menu, and the overall ruggedness of it probably meant it was legit. I'm not Vietnamese, Asian, or any shade of yellow, but I like to think I still know my food well enough to say that it was an absolute let down. I ordered one of the most basic dishes, Pho Tai which is a beef broth with rice noodles and sliced beef. It's typically served with jalapeno rings, bean sprouts, basil, and lemon wedges on the side, yet mine was minus the jalapenos and lemon. Each table of Asian people who ordered the same thing both before and after me, received the said items with their meal. After my plate of half the veggies I need arrived, they brought by our spring rolls. Again, total disappointment. The sauce which accompanied them tasted like pure Hoisin, and I much prefer the typical peanut sauce or even a fish sauce. My girlfriend's bowl of Bun looked like the noodles were garbage, and was extremely short on veggies and meat. \n\nOur server was nice enough, and rather typical of a restaurant of this type. They don't speak much, their way of asking if you'd like to order is saying \""are you done?\"" After a while though, I realized he was a Spanish speaker, and then I realized he was of hispanic heritage, nice. I come to this Vietnamese place and there are Mexicans working both front and back of the restaurant. Made me want some enchiladas. Overall, this restaurant was a complete let down and if it hadn't been for the very low price (under $20 for two people) I'd have been very upset. I'll keep sticking with Little Saigon, Pho Thanh, Koai Hoan, and Dong A."
"5","Yay! Such a pretty and happy place! The exterior is super run down shopping center style, all the shops are Viet named. There are like 3 non asians at tables and people are eating proper vietnamese food! \n\nNext pricing! Damn this mother is cheap! Pho tai 4.50 two rolls 2.25. Coffee...i didnt notice price of!\n\nTables are strewn with yummy looking food and big leaves of fresh lettuce and and and and...though it looks like they have gotten the mexican lime (lemon) on the list.\n\nSo...I gotta say...this may be in my top 10 viet joints out there. The Pho broth coulda used a little more...something...but the spring rolls were awesome, the decor and people and oh...the coffee...yes...very good too...\n\nI left here fully satisfied and without any feelings of...hmmmm...coulda done xyz better and bla bla bla...Unless someone sends me a note or a comment that suggests I try another joint in town (and has at least 10 reviews of different viet places on their list), I don't think that I need to look any further for Vietnamese food in Phoenix...\n\nOh yeah...and it is FLIPPING CHEAP!  I had: Pho Tai (meat on side), Spring Rolls, Iced Coffee Milk and I spent...12 bucks with a 30% tip!  Normally that'd be like 17 with a 12% tip..."
"5","I go here at least 1 a week with my wife.  I get the meatball Pho along with the BBQ pork Bahn Mi.  The food is great, cheap, and quick.  The staff is friendly, not in your typically way, but they do a good job.  Da Vang has become of my favorite places period in Phoenix."
"3","My husband and I along with family and friends came here today for lunch and the food is great, but service wasn't so much. I ordered the large rice noodle with beef stew, my husband had the big bowl of pho and we split an order of spring rolls. His food came out within 10 minutes and mine took about another 15 minutes. I didn't mind because I was enjoying the time with family and friends. After our meal was out I placed an order of fried rice to go and thought it would be done and ready by the time we were all done and eating. That didn't happen. I waited 20 minutes AFTER we finished our meal and paid. \n\nOverall food was great, but service wasn't. Next time I'll order the to go food when I'm ordering my meal."
"5","This place is fantastic!  Every time I go I try something different.  The family who owns, cooks and serves at Da Vang are very attentive, give great advice on what to try and really work hard to make your experience a good one!  Love, Love Love!"
"4","Great staff, awesome eat-in or take home experience.  Fish sauce to die for.  The best Vietnamese food in the Valley."
"2","= = = = = = CLOSED = = = = = =\n\nThis JB's location, with it's poor building layout, poor service & mediocre food finally folded.  Good riddance!     :-)"
"2","Same 3 star food as any other location, but here they seem much happier when you are headed out the door than when you come in. Evidenced by their never asking but assuming your order is to go."
"4","We moved to Phoenix about 6 months ago and since the first day I have been looking for a clean gym to work out in without having to get into a 1 or 2 year contract and have to pay a big sign up fee. About a month ago my husband found this ymca relatively close by and as a former military family they gave us a preferred membership fee without a sign up fee.\n\nSo far I'm really happy with this place. The work out area is spacious and the equipment are modern and clean. There is an outdoor pool and classes I haven't used yet, but so far I'm very satisfied with everything and enjoy my workouts a lot."
"2","Anyone remember Valley West Mall on 50th Ave & Northern right before it closed?  \n\nThat's what Chris-town Spectrum Mall feels like..  \n\nMy aunt worked here when I was a kid and that was back in the 80s when the mall was thriving with business and there were always a ton of great people walking around.  The food court  wasn't there just yet, but when that opened it gave it an even greater feel.  \n\nbut now..\n\nChris-Town... or face it.. lets just call it Spectrum Mall, is nothing but a ghetto run down store with a bunch of jewelry and urban clothing stores.  I'm shocked that they even have a nail shop inside... I dont mean an upper class one, I mean the ones you see in a strip mall.  The only stores that are recognizable are GNC, Bath & Body Works and shockingly... Wing Stop.. why the hell would they put a Wing Stop in there? wow..\n\nBig 5 Sports is pretty decent I guess too..\n\nI give this two stars because what was once a great mall is now nothing.  In my honest opinion, they should shut down the remaining mall section and just rebuild it as more big stores..  The only reason people go here now is Harkins, Wal-Mart, Target and JC Penny's..  oh and Costco. \n\nthink about it... What mall has all those outside stores attached to them?  None that I can think of.. unless they're hurting.\n\nRIP Chris-Town"
"2","THIRTEEN places that sell SHOES??? Run down, small, hard to get in and out of and clientele is very low on the socioeconomic ladder. Do yourself a favor and skip this mess!"
"3","Great for a dive bar.  Plus they have .99 cheese burgers during NFL Games.  Dark and Dingy like a good diver bar should be.  Always a great place to stop off at the end of the night.  Typical bar food.  \n\nThe big negative...NO DRAFT BEER."
"3","Went in for a couple of drinks with the girls, good and cheap drinks. Daily specials going on. They have 4 pool tables,  video games and juke box. You can't get bored chilling with a group of friends! Shout out to the bartender! The food was alright too! Over all a chilled place."
"2","Very typical strip mall-ish take out joint. Nothing special at all. Service is minimal and its obvious they just want to get your money and you to get out ASAP. Food was overcooked quite a bit and just not good."
"2","Tried to sell a Tarentola annularis off as a tokay gecko. Two completely different species. Said he was lost in the store for five years before \""re-apprehending\"" a completely different gecko. They need to stick to fish, because their knowledge of reptiles is simply... lacking. I've been keeping tokay geckos for YEARS, but they refused to believe me. I will not be going back myself. The owner needs to open up his mind a little."
"5","It's becoming harder and harder to find a store that sells a breadth of equipment, aquarium supplies, chemicals,  fish, and has knowledgeable sales people. Most PetSmarts and Petcos have fish departments and some, but not all, carry the more popular freshwater fish. But what if you have a question? Sure, they have an 18 year old on hand who can probably help answer questions that you could have just as easily googled but not with the more difficult questions.\n\nI found Ocean Floor years ago and it hasn't changed much over the years - and that's a good thing!  It's a well run, local business. You name it, they have it. And, they not only have it, they'll have a few to choose from. Not sure what to get? Every employee I've ever talked to was able to assist and answered questions that I didn't even think to ask.  \n\nI've purchased a number of fish from this store and I've never had a problem with them in my well maintained 55 gallon aquarium.  You'd be wise to sign up for their email newsletter (no, they don't spam you every day) - they have some pretty good sales on equipment, supplies and fish.\n\nYes, their prices are a bit higher than the chain stores but how important is it to save a dollar or two and either buy the wrong product or do some serious damage to your aquarium? I have too much invested to take the risk.\n\nFavorite fish quote:  \""I never drink water because of the disgusting things that fish do in it.\"" W. C. Fields"
"1","we rarely have McDonalds and made a big mistake by going to this McDonalds when we arrived in Phoenix late night 3/23/2013 .   The staff is rude, they messed up the order and the food was cold.  The order was packed with the fries sideways and falling out and the bread was hard and stale.  The food was so bad we wound up throwing most of it away.    The wanna-be gangsta working the window wasn't happy when we pointed out their mistake.   The owner of this McDonalds should find some people who care a bit about their job...  the 2 people their on 3/23 could care less!"
"4","Gabi's review got me jonesing for CJs so I headed back over for lunch. Maybe it's a middle age thing, but I always forgot how good they are in between visits.\n\nSince I live close by, this is pretty much how CJs and I roll: 1) hit up website, 2) read entire menu 4 to 14 times, 3) pare down top 10 selections to 1 or 2 and call in order, 4) hop in car, and 5) return home 15 minutes later for a private pig out on the coffee table (so I have room to spread out). They do offer delivery, but it takes longer to get my feast on and I don't always need / want $15 of food.\n\nSince it's all pretty much been said, let me just tell you the few things that make CJs a stand out:\n* I have never found one thing on their menu that I wouldn't order again. \n* There is nothing that CJs feta doesn't make better... bring it!\n* I could eat my weight in their pitas and never tire of them.\n* The creamy greek dressing is 'lick your plate clean' to die for.\n* You will not find a better deal on baklava anywhere in the city (seriously it would be hard to get the ingredients for the price they charge).\n\nIf you are eating in, grab a cold beer or some wine to wash down your meal (and they are working on upgrading their liquor license, so they will have mixed drinks soon).\n\nDon't let the location or the homey diner atmosphere fool you. This place serves up incredible food made from insanely fresh ingredients with flavors to match!"
"4","Great Pizza and Pitas, these guys are right down the street from work and we bring back lunch to the office about twice a month. Fresh ingredients, lots of cheese, cant go wrong. If you are showing up around lunch 11:30-12:30, it will be busy."
"2","The review by Jessica S. is correct -- the dressing for the salads is delicious and they put it on the side...so that is two positive things for the two stars I gave them.  However - if I pay over $10.00 for a salad...I want something OTHER than iceburg lettuce (even if it's just a little romaine and/or spinach) and pitted olives.  I asked for no grilled onions and light on the pepper -- when I received my plate, their were onions and peppers all over the place.  If you're going to offer \""salads\"" as a main course...they should be worth it.  That was the worst $11.00 salad I've ever had."
"4","I feel so blessed that I haven't had to write a bad review lately.  One reason is I ate at Crazy Jim's!  \nSoooooooo good.  The hummus was creamy and you can tell freshly made.  The pita came out a little differently than I'm used to.  Instead of just warmed, it seems it was maybe fried in a little olive oil (I'm guessing) to make it a little crispier than other restaurants and tastier.  I'm a fan of this style.\nI got the chicken patra pita and there was so much chicken, cheese, and peppers that I had to eat it with a fork and knife.  There was no way I could pick that baby up and eat it without everything falling out.  The chicken was tender and juicy.  The tzatziki sauce was delicious.  My side salad was full of green, leafy lettuce.  Quality food.  \nOur server was so overly friendly too.  I can't wait to go back!  \nYUMMY!"
"1","OK, so we ordered pizza for delivery and we made a mistake on our address, we just moved and have an incorrect apartment number.  After we realized our mistake we called pizza hut only to find out the driver had attempted to deliver the pizza but could not due to our mistake.  After calling the store and correcting our error we waited for our new pie to arrive. We waited, and waited and waited.  After more than an hour our pie was delivered and it was... Horrible!  I am confident that it was the same pie they attempted to deliver more than 2 hours ago.  Called the store and spoke with the manager who was less than friendly and was assured that a driver would be by, sometime tonight, to pick up the pie and give us a refund.  We shall see...."
"4","Finally got to check out this spot and man am I a happy dude. They have a huge menu, all seafood! They had close to 10 different types of cold cocktail salads (shrimp, abalone, calamari, octopus, squid etc.) and a few ceviches. They have some seafood based tacos and tostadas as well We went with a small Octopus cocktail ($5.00), a calamari cocktail ($5.00), a crabmeat tostada ($5.00) and the ceviche ((5.00) I have to say everything was awesome awesome awesome. The broth for the cocktails was perfectly seasoned and not too much citrus. You could tell the veggies were recently cut and the fish was super fresh! I think the standout of the whole meal was my crabmeat tostada. It literally had probably 1/4 of solid good crab meat, with a few avocado slices and a tomato. Insanely simple, let the fish speak for itself. The ceviche was great too. It's a small little restaurant right on the side of the road, but it was very clean and the workers were super nice. I think the total damage was $27 with our food, and a large Horchata. I know I'll be going back. If you're a fan of fresh really simple seafood dishes, this is the spot!"
"4","My deadbeat boyfriend used to be in charge of the hardware department but since I kicked him to the curb I've had to venture out into this realm.  So happy I found this place on Yelp.  Can't say enough about the great customer service.  So glad they had knowledgeable people to help this dingbat out and find just what I needed.\n\nThe only downside (and hence the four stars) was the pricing seemed a little high.  Not that I'm the best judge mind you.  I think I could have saved at Home Depot but then again I wouldn't have got the same level of help so it's a trade off is all I'm saying."
"2","The food is ok. Average so a 3 however the attitude is a 1. We ordered the Chicken quesadilla and was charged 1$ more than posted. She said she couldn't do anything and didn't credit the difference. Based on that they get a 2."
"4","Just transplanted from SoCal! I have been staying over at my fathers house. He took me here for dinner one day. He used to play with his band here years ago with the owner. The food here is awesome, I have had their pork carnitas, and their steak picado. Both plates were great. I will come back here more often."
"2","It's in a neighborhood that looks to be conducive to quality Mexican food.  I mean crap, Chi Chi's Cabaret is right up the road (apparently).  But I think the food failed to hit the mark in terms of outstanding Mexican/Sonoran fare.  It was lackluster and not very tasty.\n\nLots of decent reviews caused me to go out of my way to eat here with my family.  The prices were a little steep for the food they gave.  $12 dollar enchilada plates and $10 dinner specials.  \n\nI'd have to say the stand out entree of the night was my plate.  I ordered the MP-1 which was basically a Green Tamale dinner.  It was actually pretty good.  I like the hint of sweetness that is present in the masa.  The beans were decent as well and tasted homemade not canned.\n\nBut there wasn't anything very 'Green' in any of the flavor of the entree.  \n\nOtherwise, everything was pretty standard.  Service was great.  Food came fast.  But all in all, I wasn't knocked off my feet.  \n\nI might possibly give this place another chance.  I really did like the ambience and location.  We'll see."
"2","I live in the neighborhood and have been eating here for years. (Both take out and dine in). I don't know if they have new cooks or what, but the quality of the food has slowly gone down hill in the last (6) months to the point I don't think we'll eat there again. The refried beans WERE FROM A CAN. I know homemade versus canned and these are canned. The Cheese Crisp was really lacking and very oily. The shredded beef taco had a lot of fat on the beef. This place used to serve really good Mexican food. Not so anymore. We're going back to Sylvia's La Canasta or Macayo's. Much better food, and not from a can."
"4","Good food, good price, good service."
"5","I've been coming to La Pi\u00f1ata for years and it is consistently delish!! Rice and beans are a deciding factor for me and theirs are YUM. I've never had anything not good! Do yourself a favor and ask for the hot salsa!"
"4","All I can say is don't judge a book by its cover ...  This is a family owned and run place where the food is inexpensive but every dish is fresh, delishious! & flavorful. \n\nTheir sauces are amazingly scrumptious. Yin's has to be my all-time favorite Chinese restaurants in Phoenix. I mean I know good Chinese food when I have it and considering the options available in Phoenix this is one of the better Chinese restaurants period.\n\nThey take standard dishes and add high-end ingredients and interesting flavors. They are very consistent (never had a bad meal). All the dishes are wonderful, you can't go wrong with anything.  Particularly good is their Wor Wonton Soup.\n\nFOOD:  The food is always consistent (never had a bad meal). The food is superb!PRICE: The price was also quite reasonable. SERVICE:  the service has always been great  prompt, polite, and attentive.  AMBIENCE:  Just right for the neighborhood. The interior is rather standard Chinese restaurant fare, so nothing special there. CONCLUSION: I would highly recommend this place."
"4","I have a special place in my heart for My Mother's because it was where I broke my 15 year streak of vegetarianism.  And I never had any of the alleged gastrointestinal repercussions that I anticipated.\n\nThe roast turkey is better than my mom ever made, not that it means much because my mom never cooked.  But it's still good.  The salad bar is pretty awesome too.  It's small, but they manage to fit almost every thing I could possibly want into a four foot long space.  And, they have real homeade bleu cheese dressing that tastes like bleu cheese throughout.  Not like the crappy version that tastes like ranch with bleu cheese lumps in it.\n\nI had the pizza once and was incredibly underwhelmed.  Maybe it's better when you get it at the restaurant and not as take-out, but I'll never try it again.  It reminded me of a frozen pizza.\n\nToday, because we're on a mission to find awesome wings, ordered some wings as our appetizer.  Our entrees came out before our appetizer.  But when we told the waiter they immediately put them in to cook to our specifications.  Then they didn't charge us for it.  Nice!  Bad service?  No, just an honest mistake that they immediately corrected.\n\nThe wings however were not that good.  They were cooked crispy like we like it and the sauce had the right ingredients, but the ratio of butter:vinegar:heat was off.  Too much butter!  I felt like I was eating wings in cream sauce it was so buttery.  It coated my mouth with an oily gunk for far too long.  Maybe I wouldn't have noticed if it actually came as an appetizer.\n\nI still love My Mother's, particularly for the stuff that my mother should have made: turkey, chicken, meat loaf, turkey pot pie, etc.  But I would stay away from the wings and pizza."
"3","Decent food. The pizza is really cheap and when I got it I realized why it was so cheap not that great. The reason I gave my mommas 3 stars is for there amazing homemade pies if you get a slice its huge looks like half of a pie. Would recommend it for the pie but you can better food around the valley."
"1","The first time we had My Mother's Restaurant was months ago. My husband and I were feeling homesick, and being from Illinois we got excited when we saw that My Mother's Restaurant had deep dish \""Chicago Style.\"" It was such a lie and a huge let down. The pizza was not deep dish,  it was not \""Chicago Style,\"" rather it was thick crust. It was so thick that we could not taste the topping, just the crust. \n---------------------\nLast night we decided to give this place another try since our favorite pizza restaurant was closed. After being on hold for almost 10 minutes right off the get go (which was no big deal since they were busy), my husband finally got to talk to someone. He had to repeat the pizza topping order twice, and the buffalo wings four times. They told us 35-45 mins since they were busy. \n\nWhen the delivery finally came, we were starving and I was really looking forward to their wings (I had been craving buffalo wings for weeks now).  The pizza was okay, the topping were correct but the dough was a little on the dry side. Now for the wings I had been craving, that came with a side of ranch and celery. They sent us the wrong one. They sent BBQ, and not the buffalo that we wanted, even after my husband repeated himself four times. \n\nI've heard that their other food is great but after last night's dinner being such a failure, we will never be ordering from this restaurant again. We've been disappointed with them twice now. \n\nWe like to support local restaurants, we won't be supporting this one."
"3","Dinner here with family members. Large, varied menu. Heather was our server. She was pleasant and efficient. I had the ribs and salad  bar. Salad bar had a good selection of veggies and dressings. Ribs were OK but not stellar. Mashed potatoes were real and gravy was tasty.. I want to try the chicken fried chicken sometime. My sister had the blt and it was loaded with bacon."
"1","Wish I could only give them 1 star.  We had a pretty large order delivered to us.  One of the girls found a roach in their food.  Not a little bitty thing a big freaking roach. After that no one ate their food.  If you have one roach you have thousands or roaches.  When we called them, they said well it was only a problem with one, we will bring you a new order... Yeah No, you will come and pick up all your food and refund us the money.  After arguing about that for a bit, they finally did just that.  Will never be eating their again!"
"3","Pho Bang is a chain of franchise restuaurants started out of New York City. There are 3 in NYC, 3 in Houston, and one each in Taipei, New Orleans and this one in Phoenix. \n\nIt is old and grungy, and hard to get to with the light rail construction. The prices are dirt cheap, the decor is dirt cheap and the food is un-remarkable. They offer most of the usual Vietnamese dishes, from Goi Cuon appetizers (summer rolls) to Bun (vermicelli), Mi (egg noodles), Com (rice plates) to stir fry chicken, pork, beef; also seafood, some specials and Pho soups (16 different ones).\n\nThe Pho comes in 2 sizes, with most regulars costing only $3.95, and the large costing $4.50. Their large is equivalent to many places' medium, however. The broth is average at best, and all the accroutements are too. \n\nI am not sure how the franchise works (royalties, menus, common logo, etc) but if you want a very cheap meal and you are not a snob or afficianado of Vietnamese food, this places works for a quick filler. They will show Korean Drama DVDs dubbed in Vietnamese on the TV if you ask. They will watch Korean Dramas themselves when it is slow anyway, even if you don't ask! Winter Sonata anyone?\n\nPS - Pho Bang in San Jose is not affiliated with this chain."
"2","Update: 05/01 For some reason it didn't give me an update button; only edit...so I am adding the new one above: \n\nAnother day and I continue to be dumbfounded by this location. In March I used to order the 6\"" breakfast sandwich and drink at the $3 combo price. That promo was not there in April in lieu of the buy one get one free special that this location never seemed to get correct. \n\nToday is May and I ordered my standard 6\"" flatbread bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich. As I progressed down the line I noticed the $3 combo sign was back up. In every other Subway location when checking out they ask if you want a combo, and if you say yes they push combo, and the register gives the combo price. After seeing the sign that says 6\"" sandwich and 21 oz drink $3, I removed a 21oz cup. The lady rang it up and said $5.50. I asked how do I get the combo? She said oh, you have to tell me that. Then frustrated she hit several buttons until it reflected the price. Shouldn't the combo be a standard item? All other times they ask if the customer wants a combo. If the combo is a sandwich and a medium drink and a customer orders and sandwich then takes a medium cup, shouldn't that be a clue? Either way, I think this location needs some additional training. \n\n\n\n04/30/12: There seems to be confusion on the April promo of buy one get one free. It says get a free 6\"" sandwich when you buy any 6\"" sandwich before 9. My first attempt I ordered the sandwich and nothing was mentioned. I came back for lunch and asked how it worked. The lady said the customer has to tell them in the morning, they enter a code, and it prints on the receipt. No free one that day. \n\nI went back again to the same location and upon ordering my breakfast sandwich I asked about the free one. She said I could get it now. I don't want it now. I want it at lunch. I don't want it sitting on my desk attracting germs nor do I want to re-heat it to kill said germs. After saying I didn't want it now, she said okay. It wasn't entered and actually I didn't even get a receipt :-/\n\nThe product line is the same as every Subway. The challenge is the shop is small with limited seating and fills up quickly at lunch."
"3","This is the only Savers that I have shopped in. Normally I go to smaller thrift shops and vintage shops. This is a large facility, with lots of clothes. I was not impressed by the pricing. There were some of the same exact items that I have found at Ross for cheaper. But I was happy to find a pair of brand new Michael Kors Platforms for only $9.99. I would probably go back, but I would want to have more time to search the racks."
"5","This place is awesome.  Nestled between a convenience store and an adult book store on Indian School and 31st Ave., you'll miss it if you don't know to look for it.  I was introduced to Angie's & Jimmie's by a co-worker, and I am so grateful!  This place is a dive, but the food is awesome, the waitstaff are friendly, and you get a ton of food for a tiny price!  I ordered the hot turkey and cheese sub.  I wish I had known to order the half sub, because the whole sub was ENORMOUS.  I was hard-pressed to finish half, and the other made for a very filling dinner later that night.  The fresh cut fries are wonderfully seasoned, and one serving is more than enough for two people to split.  My co-worker ordered the small order of wings (12) , expecting your run-of-the mill bite-sized wings, but what she got was a heaping plate of HUGE wings.  She was able to get through four of them.  As if that weren't enough, this place offers a monster-sized 28\"" pizza!  The same co-worker and I are heading back there today, and I'm looking forward to enjoying some pizza.  And fries, of course!"
"5","I wouldn't go so far as to call the place a dive but it is a definite hole in the wall...next to a Circle K on a not so decent stretch of Indian School. Once you get inside though, things change. \n\nEnough of a variety on the menu to satisfy everyone and the prices are very reasonable. I ordered the cold Italian combo as my friend wasn't sure if they still offered half sandwiches (and I didn't have the common sense to ask), and she had the chicken parm. The woman at the counter was busy as hell as it was the middle of lunch hour, juggling the counter orders as well as the incoming phone calls, but she was still very friendly as well as the other younger woman in all black (didn't hurt that she was cute. LOL). Less than $20 for 2 huge sandwiches and 2 \""gallon o' drank\"" sodas.\n\nFor how busy it was there was plenty of seating (at your generic plastic patio furniture) and the food came out quick. Mind you I'm a big guy and this sandwich was as long as my forearm and as big around as my upper arm. The meat on my sandwich was of an ample quantity and quality, and the veggies were nice and fresh, particularly the tomatoes which were at a perfect ripeness, and pepperocinis (3 to a plate, a generous amount as they were quite large and juicy).  Like the other reviewer I could not finish my whole sandwich, the same lady that had taken our order and brought our food came at the most convenient time to offer to wrap it for me. It is now in my fridge awaiting a quick death later on.\n\nNow that I am working near here (less than a block away, natch) I'm glad my friend knew about it and showed me, as I wasn't looking forward to McDonald's every day at lunch and there isn't much else in the neighborhood."
"3","For the record, I'm the world's worst vegetarian. Well, pescetarian, but yelp doesn't think that's a real word. Whatever. I'm bad at all of it. I have a weakness for wings. \n\nWhat's even worse is that I didn't even KNOW i had this weakness until Jetta R and Amanda B decided to pray upon it by taking me to Angie and Jimmie's. The wings were already on the table when I walked in the door. I never stood a chance. Just like the bacon on Christmas morning. Don't judge me. \n\nThe interior, pizza and ambiance are questionable at best. Those other reviews are SO NOT LYING about the plastic furniture. Which is weird, since the serving plates are those trendy square ones in earth tones. Extra points for not having enough parking spaces - thus resulting in us parking in the lot for the porn store next door. If I was half the pig I'm willing to admit I'd take sick joy in that juxtaposition. \n\nBut you didn't come to A&J for the pizza. You didn't come here to impress a date. You came here for wings. Because you trust me to send you to good wings. And Angie and Jimmie's knows wings. They know them like Jetta R. knows wrestling and B movies. They know them so well they taught ME to love wings. And to question my entire veg-leaning lifestyle. \n\nDamn you, Angie and Jimmies. I have to rethink my entire outlook on food because of you. Maybe I should mull over what I'm doing with my life over another order of mediums with squeeze bottle ranch..."
"2","went to drive thru, Smh. Horrible customer service. The girl made a rude comment after I changed the size of my blizzard. So rude!!! If you don't like your job. LEAVEEEE!"
"1","I've always enjoyed taking my family to Bill Johnson's, but on our recent visit (2/29/12) the quality of the food, the portion sizes, and their new prices have took a turn for the worse.\n\nThe bbq pork ribs were tough as leather, the fries were very greasy and portion controlled to the max, the mac and cheese seemed like they just poured liquid cheese on top of the boiled macaroni, and to make it worse, the prices on the menu have skyrocketed.  I feel that if their going to charge more for their menu items, the quality of the food and portion sizes need to be changed as well.  I was very disappointed with the amount of money we spent for the crappy food we ate.  \n\nFurthermore, I expressed my concerns with the waitress, but she didn't seem very interested at all.  With that said, I will NEVER return to Bill Johnson's because of the BIG let down.  This was once a great place to eat, but after they filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, this restaurant went downhill."
"2","Best to stick to the apple pie.  The breakfast  especially the sausage is reflective of the prices. Cheap."
"5","Historic Institution filled with the coolest cars you've ever seen. Great service, good prices, cool guys. 5 *'s."
"1","If I could give this place no stars, I would. I was once very fond of this place. That was until they changed directors. \n\nThey aren't consistent with sending home daily reports with the children. I'm the kind of parent that likes to know how my kids did in daycare. I like to know the good and the bad. When they sent home reports, hey would say \""had a great day!\"" Well, what made their day so great? Also, they would send home a good report, but when I talk with the teacher, they would tell me how bad my child was. I asked why it wasn't on the reports I received and they said they write the reports mid day. How backwards is that? There are some teachers there who really seemed to care, but there seems to be too many cooks in the kitchen. The management team would often refer to \""the owners\"" but when I asked who the owners were they said they don't distribute that information. Huh?! If someone is going to be around my children, I want to know who they are! They do have a clean facility. They also have a lot of different daily activities for the children to play with. But they need better trained staff. All of their teachers are not certified. \n\nAlso, I had an issue with kids bullying my son. They didn't try to resolve it. I requested a meeting with he kids parents because most people know that one major factor in resolving bullying is with the help of all parents involved. Well, they out right ignored me. I won't be making a recommendation for this daycare to anyone."
"1","I have been to many Harbor Freight stores here in the \""valley\"". Most, the staff have been very helpful and only 5 or 6 people in line at the most. Great deals on merchandise for those that are patient ; ) This location at 35th Ave and Bethany Home is the worst. On some Fridays at about 2pm, the management and day staff goes home early leaving the store short staffed with only 2 clerks. One has a bad attitude. The \""head cashier\"" who looks like she's a local tweaker allowed a line to build up of literally 20 customers and refused to open a register herself. The only cashier that was open was helping a customer for about 15 minutes with check problems and was dialing away numbers to the Camarillo, CA office to get approval. It took her 15 minutes to reach someone in accounting while the 20 of us stood in a long line waiting. Some of us asked the head cashier to open up a register and ring us up. She refused and blamed the company for short staffing her. Bad attitude. Told us this is just the was it is on Fridays when the staff runs out from day shift. Finally at 3pm a manager walks in the store and asks whats going on. Some of us customers complained and this cashier finally hops on a register so she doesn't get reamed by the manager. I will not be back to this store location. I will stick with the Glendale and Tempe locations."
"4","The Great Wall was my first dim sum experience, making me what you might call a tableau rosa*.  Since I know nothing about dim sum, all I can do is share my overall general biased by my own narrow existence perception of the place.  So here it goes.  As usual, Mr. K has accurately described and captured the essence of this restaurant in his review, so there's that.  Read his review.  What I can add is this.  The food all tasted good to me.  The atmosphere was fun and lively.  The demo is certainly nothing like any place I've ever been to in Phoenix, so those who decry the lack of diversity in this town, perhaps you just need to expand your horizons to include Great Wall into your rotation. And I would go back.  I have to get on the HIGHWAY to drive here, so that is saying a lot.  For those of you who are directionally challenged, it's the first shopping plaza on the east side of 35th Avenue, just north of Camelback.    \n\n*It's been years and years and years since high school English.  For some reason I think this means \""blank slate.\""  If not strike \""tableau rosa\"" and insert \""blank slate\"" above."
"4","I think the dim sum was pretty good but their service was alright.  for some reason they seemed pissed off when they were pushing the dim sum cart....."
"1","The worse service."
"3","Finally made it out to Great Wall for dim sum. I've been hearing so much about this place but I am hardly ever in this area so it was sitting in my \""to try\"" list for quite some time. Walking in, I thought, this is gonna be legit. The place was packed to the rim with asian people waiting to get their dim sum on. The decor and vibe reminded me a lot of dim sum restaurants in LA's chinatown circa 1990's (ABC seafood to be exact). \n\nWe didn't have to wait long before we were seated. We tried their sui mai, shrimp rice noodle, deep fried shrimp and chives wrapped in bean curd, and honestly I forgot the rest because it was all nothing memorable and I usually have a great memory. The chives and shrimp bean curd roll was probably my favorite of the bunch but I'm a sucker for any dumpling, cake, roll with chives :) It was something I haven't seen at other dim sum restaurants before so I enjoyed that.\n\nIn summary, it was okay. It satisfied my dim sum craving but... would I come back? Probably not. I live in Chandler and I find my two go-to dim sum spots there (Phoenix Palace & China King) much tastier. && I only have to drive 5 minutes to get there. Actually, if I lived near Great Wall, I'd probably make the drive to Phoenix Palace. Yep.. I think it's that much better!"
"3","Dim Sum review only***\n\nFood is a 4-star rating, but the location and the decor of the restaurant isn't as pleasant. Located in the corner of the a big strip mall, you can't believe how big the restaurant is from the outside, which has no windows, with a small glass door... There is always a line for dim sum during the peak hour, but definitely worth to wait, if you have an asian friend who knows what to order can tag along, that is even better!\n\nVery good dim sum and cheap price, just don't expect a fancy place. Have fun~"
"4","Pros and con's as follows.\n\nPros:  overall variety of food is good.\nShrimp sushi roll then deep fried-good\nSome funky sticky rice -too thick and sticky-,not good\nShrimp noodles, good. A texture I'm not particularly fond of, but flavor good.\nLo mein type noodles--good\nDuck-good, despite not a lot of meat\nTwice fried pork, really good.\nChicken wings-really good ( not really Asian or Chinese but I really like crispy wings)\nShrimp shumai really good\nGreens-i think they were some sort of asian broccoli.\n\nMy favorite things were the tea, sesame ball with sweet filling and shumai.\n\nCon's,:  way too busy and crowded but there's nothing you can do about that. That's just the way dim sum is\n\nI don't like getting passed up by anyone with the carts. Some don't speak any English so you don't know what they are offering and combine that with the din and the language barrier, it got a little frustrating. \n\nPrices- no clue.\n\nI love Asian food and rarely get anything good in the valley so this is quite good. I will go again"
"1","Can I give 0 stars?  When I walked into the showroom,  the salesman approached me with an attitude that I was bothering him!  I asked for the best price OTD on the motorcycle I wanted and he gave me a price that was 10% ($700) higher than the price I was quoted with Western Honda.  I told the salesman that price is high and he said \""Go buy it from Western Honda\""  He did not bother to ask me if I was paying cash (which I was) or try to add incentives to encourage me to buy from him.  I have never dealt with a salesman like that in my life (and I am no spring chicken).   If they treat everyone this way, I wonder how they sell anything!  Don't waste your time, as far as salesmanship - total incompetence.  By the way, he lied to me about the price they had advertised online.  Dishonest and rude, if that is what you are looking for, by all means visit this shop.  The salesman was a total dufus and you can get a much better deal on a Honda with Western Honda.  I wish I had the salesman's name, but of course he did not bother to introduce himself.  He was an older gentleman in the first office on the left."
"1","Another disappointing experience.  Why can they make good al pastor tacos. Don't even use real corn tortillas. The only good thing was the horchata."
"1","Shasta pols workmanship was ok however the crew told me they would be finished in one day. around 3 pm they were gone with the job 1/2 done. I wasn't informed that they were leaving for the day. they also left a mess with garbage, wires and tools laying around. on day 2 they finished the job and did very basic clean up. they clearly had no respect for my property or my stuff. I informed the office of the lack of supervision of the crew. I was informed that the Supervisor only checks the work after it is completed. I would not recommend them."
"2","This will be a 2-part review: 1 for the \""free consultation\"" aspect, and another for the actual experience with staff/ professionals at Bethany Home Healthcare.  I'd give ONE STAR for misleading information on the website & verbally by staff.  I'd give THREE STARS for service.\n\""FREE CONSULTATION\"": Thanks to another reviewer who mentioned an issue with the \""free consultation\"", I made sure to ask this upon the initial phone conversation & was assured it was a \""free consultation\"".  A receptionist called to confirm the appointment, and again assured me it was \""free\"".  I had my husband call & he specifically asked if it was free for someone who was insured, \""due to something he had heard\"".  The receptionist stated, \""yes, it is free regardless of an insured or uninsured individual\"".  Upon arrival, we were asked to fill out detailed paperwork asking for insurance information.  When we questioned this, the receptionist was not rude, but stated that the consultation \""would be free for us, but Bethany Healthcare would bill our insurance because we're in fact insured\"".  Since we were insured, they had to bill someone.  If we weren't insured, they would not have anyone to bill.  \n\n\""ACTUAL SERVICE\"": We were here to inquire about midwife services for the birth of our 1st child.  We were not greeted when we arrived and the reception staff rarely looked up & out into the waiting room.  We arrived 20 minutes early (as requested to fill out paperwork) & still waited over 40 minutes after our scheduled appointment time.  We were taken to a small exam room to speak to a technician, and waited another 10-15 minutes for the Certified Nurse Midwife.  The CNM, Donna, was friendly & understanding: she explained their role, listened to our concerns/ desires, and answered as many questions as she could regarding our curiosity about giving birth at Phoenix Baptist with a Bethany midwife.  Unfortunately after waiting 1 hour for our initial consultation, Donna had to end our session after 35 minutes due to another appointment.          \n\nI'm confident that the 6 CNM's at BHH would provide quality midwife services, as they seem experienced and reviews show them to be caring & understanding of a woman's desires during pregnancy and childbirth.  But based on our experience, we did not choose to use the services of Bethany Home Healthcare.  \nMinor note: there was also a \""no eating or drinking\"" sign in the waiting room, which we found odd for a facility that requires pregnant patients to wait for over 1 hour."
"2","I chose this facility for my first pregnancy because I wanted to have a natural as possible delivery and I'd read the the midwives here were very supportive of that. Let me just say that every single visit I had to wait at least an hour to be seen, the ladies at the desk were rude lazy and all they did was talk badly of the midwives.  Once I waited almost 2 hours because they hasn't even checked me in and let my midwife know I was there for my appointment. There were 3 midwives that I loved, one of whom was new and actually ended up being the one at my delivery, the other 2 I absolutely hated. One told me she didn't care that I wanted to avoid drugs and intervention and told me there was no point in considering it. The other actually told me that she was offended I hadn't seen her regularly instead of another and was irritated by every question I had. The ultrasound tech didnt even ask if we wanted to know the gender she just blurted it out, thats fine because we wanted to know but for other families who choose not to i thought that was unprofessional and insensitive, she also always acted like she was upset and annoyed. The midwife I saw regularly was Kim and she was wonderful except for one thing. My delivery at Phoenix Baptist hospital was a nightmare, after the anesthesiologist screwed up my epidural TWICE I declined another and she literally pinned me and they forced yet another excruciating epidural on me. I don't know if that was her or the hospitals choice but it was extremely traumatic for me. Ultimately I was forced into a c-section. I think that if they changed the front desk staff and didn't force patients to deliver at Phoenix baptist hospital this practice would be a lot more successful and patients would be happier. Personally I will not choose them for my second pregnancy."
"3","Ok, so I typically never go the corporate restaurant route and here in Sunnyslope we have a couple of really awesome pizza places......so why did I eat here?\n\nWell, my grandmother (who lives in VA) is practically obsessed with Dominos Pizza.  She raves about it constantly and so I went here to get her a gift card for Christmas.\n\nWhen I was a kid, I hated Dominos, I thought it was awful.  I had heard they improved and I was already there so I figured why not.  I got a pepperoni pizza, thin crust.\n\nIt was decent.  Nothing to write home about, but it was decent.\n\nThe customer service here is great btw, so I definitely endorse it, if you're looking for corporate."
"2","I have been to other Urgent Cares, and no experience was quite like the one I experienced on Thursday.\nAfter getting home from a job interview, I promptly slipped on a stair and broke my foot. The bone was sticking out, not through the skin, but definitely poking out. Immediate thought - I should go to the hospital, but my copay is way too expensive for my student budget, so my roommate drove me over to Advanced Urgent Care.\nThe wait wasn't long, but I wasn't happy when the woman at the desk saw me limping in, and had me stand there and fill out paperwork for ten minutes. A nurse in a wheelchair came out and wheeled me in to get it over with.\nAfter sitting for awhile and answering the usual questions, I was wheeled in to a room to wait for an X-Ray. I took out my phone to call mum to let her know where I was, and the woman at the desk immediately began snapping at me that there were no cell phones allowed in the room. Okay then.\nThen, nurses began flocking in to gawk at my foot. I'm not a freaking animal in a zoo, do not come in and stare in awe at the size my foot has swollen to and make me feel more like an imbecile for breaking it. \nAfter being stared at, I was wheeled in for Xrays and then taken to a room to wait for the doctor.\nShe came in pretty quickly and immediately began poking my foot with the \""Does this hurt?!\"" questions. Of course it hurts! Stop yanking on it repeatedly. After looking at Xrays and my foot, she informed she was unconfident in saying my foot was broken.\nDay later, a call back from the radiologist who wants to know if it's my hand or my foot, whether it's my left or my right, just left me feeling shocked and slightly concerned that they were unable to tell that in an Xray...\nGoing to the doctor the next day when she's open, it's broken in two places, which she pointed out clearly on the Xray I had picked up from Urgent Care.\nWhat. A. Joke. I would never come here again for a broken bone, but probably something they can't misdiagnose and send me home to suffer with."
"5","I have NEVER had such a great experience ordering flowers. This is truly customer service at its highest level. Tony did a fantastic job helping me to order flowers for my girlfriend and at such last minute as well. NOT only did he provide excellent service, he made a special run to the grocery store to purchase an add-on item I wanted to send her. \nWOW!! I am truly impressed with their great service and help."
"5","If you have a gianormous tree to be trimmed, these are the guys to do it.  Friendly, low cost, and did a fantastic job.  I had a large palo verde and eucalyptus tree (2 stories high) to trim and they have the right knowledge and tools to get the job done.  They even picked up some extra debris in my yard!  Thanks H&S!"
"5","I am super happy with the service I received.  I called and spoke with Jerry - he came out the same day and gave me an  estimate - which was very fair.  They scheduled my tree trimming for the next day!  Alex was great.  He introduced himself right from the start and made sure we were on the same page.  He and his crew did a great job!  They even cleaned everything up and left it looking nicer than before they came.  I highly recommend them!!!  And I will use them again!"
"4","Pricing was very competitive compared to 5 other companies.  Great work and clean- up.  It took them two days instead of 1 day as estimated to remove two 40' high pine trees.  I would use them again if the need arises."
"5","I called VERY last minute to ask for a special order on a cake for my mom's birthday cake and the very sweet woman who answered made it happen for me! Not only was she able to put everything I wanted on it, but she made it fresh and had it ready in only a few hours. When I went in to pick it up, it looked exactly how I had imagined. Since I was there I picked up a few cupcakes for one of my employees birthdays and the girls said that they were AMAZING! I will definitely be going back to this gem. I wasn't disappointed at all!"
"5","I love Ace Hardware. It is like an old-fashioned hardware store; not like your big box Lowes or Home Depot. It's small and quaint and the same four people work there every day. And, if you go in enough times, I suspect it would be like walking into the Cheer's bar  -- where everybody knows your name. \n\nThe fact is, Ace Hardware has just as much stuff as those other huge home improvement stores. They just don't carry as much of a selection or stock as many items. Nevertheless, every time I have some sort of home repair need, they always have exactly what I'm looking for.\n\nYou walk in, are greeted by the friendly cashier and asked what you are looking for. And just as quickly as you can say \""thingamajig,\"" they show you were it's at. Now that is what I call service.  No need to stand around waiting for someone to help you or go searching the entire 50,000 square foot store for one small item. Nope, like the jingle proclaims.. \""Ace is the place!\"" And, by golly, it is!"
"5","I really love this place they make the best greek salad ever, the customer service is wonderful, they are prompt with my order and the food tastes better each and every time!"
"5","Who wouldn't love a restaurant with great prices, deep fuschia walls (yes!), friendly service, great food ... and lots of parking? (Hear that, Los Reyes de la Torta?)\n\nUpon reading Daren C's review, I decided to try this place for lunch and had the pleasure of having Daren join me too. I ordered the green chili burro lunch special. The burro was huge, had large chunks of tender beef, and was nicely seasoned. The rice that came with the meal was tasty, and the beans - wow, they're knock-your-socks-off good! We tried asking the server how they got their beans to taste so extraordinarily smoky-good, and all she could (or would) tell us was that they used a certain kind of Mexican seasoned oil. Hmm, culinary secrets are sometimes hard to pry out of people. A great, generous meal for $5.35, tax included. So happy to have this gem in my neck o' the woods!"
"1","Lived here for 2 years. Everything was ok for the most part, until we were getting ready to move out. The water heater in the apartment above us broke, and was leaking water into our laundry room. It took them 3 weeks to getting around to fix it- by that time, the damage was so bad they had to pull out almost all the drywall, and the studs inside had molded. \nThen, we had the carpet cleaned (900 sq ft apartment), and were told it wasn't good enough, so we had the company we used come back and do it again. Management still wasn't satisfied, and we were told that they would have the carpets cleaned and it would come out of our deposit. We were also told we would be charged a small cleaning fee, which would also come out of our $300 deposit. We said fine, dropped off the keys, made sure they had BOTH sets of forwarding addresses, and left- this was august 28th, 2013. \n\nToday, Nov. 14, 2013, I got a call from a bill collector stating that Rancho viejo had turned over a bill for $94 in cleaning fees. NO ATTEMPT was ever made by rancho viejo to contact myself, my husband, or our roommate about this. RV had 3 phone numbers, 3 email addresses, and 2 physical addresses, but made no attempt to contact us about the problem. Worst apartment complex ever.\n\nBottom line: be very careful and document everything when you move out, or they will try to screw you over."
"2","You would think a pet grooming service that has been in business so long would make sure they hire great groomers.  I did not have a good experience at all.  My Bichon was cut so close to her skin and it was very uneven, also had three razor burns on her stomach.  I think I could have done a better job than they did.  Will not use again!!"
"3","Ditto to everything Kelly said. I'm a graphic design graduate from this school. Except I had to take a screenwriting class. WTF? I guess that was the only way to knock out that last English credit, but what a pain. \n\nI wouldn't say it's a \""total rip-off\"" like Shirleen. I had some very good classes and some very good teachers. I also got some good experience and it helped me fill my portfolio with realistic design projects like identity systems and annual reports.\n\nIf you've already got some skills and are just looking to hone them and get a degree, it's a decent place to go, especially if you can nab a scholarship. You'll get the fundamental design classes that involve painting little color studies with gouache and painstakingly hand-rendering typefaces with microscopically-nibbed pens, but they don't dwell on that stuff like a lot of the university design programs do. They quickly move you in to classes with projects that imitate things you'd have to do in the real world.\n\nIf you have no clue how to do anything even remotely creative and you're hoping this school will teach you how... if you have a problem accepting constructive criticism... if you want a standard college experience with sports teams and picking your own class schedule... don't bother, you'll just be one of the many first-year dropouts."
"1","My girlfriend and I where totally lied to by everyone we talked to. Finally someone from finacial aid pulled me into a side office away from the enrollment counselors and pointed out bachelor's degree would cost a minimum of 90k... I recieve the maxium amount of grants and loans, I still would have have to pay over $1000 out of pocket every month to cover tuition... Throughout the course of the meeting I consistantly asked why my finacial wouldn't cover the total cost of tuition when at other schools (that cost the same per credit hour) I would be getting a refund to help cover the cost of housing. Everytime I asked it no one would answer me... They just tried to push me to the point of signing papers and paying the application fee... I went home, got online and did my own research, the reason their tuition ends up being more per degree is because they make you take 60 more credit hours... FOR THE SAME DEGREE!!!! If i was going to 90k for an undergraduate degree I would attend an Ivy league school... F$%^ THAT SCHOOL... The best part is when the enrollment counselor could see that I wasn't going to sign or pay anything until I did my own research, she started getting super aggressive to the point if she wasn't a girl the meeting probably would have ended voilently... How can she even get mad at me? If they wouldn't have lied to me in the beginning I wouldn't have been there... The situation felt like I was being screwed by a used car salesman..."
"3","I haven't been in a QT in years.  Mostly buying Chevron gas and when the desire arises buying stuff in their convenience stores.  They must be doing something right here as the place is packed every time I go by.  Going inside they definitely have a system for hot and cold snacks.  A whole row of coffee urns, another for hot dogs and such. Two cash registers, each working two lines.  They have taken getting people in and out seriously.  I'll probably stop in again for a snack just to get a better feel of what all is in there."
"2","Their prices are getting out of control.  FOR SALAD?  Dudes, your dinner prices are getting exorbitant.  At these rates, the \""premium\"" items like the proteins should be included with the meal.   Sorry Sweet Tomatoes, you just priced yourself out of the ballpark.  Back to SouperSald.  Just crazy lately!!!"
"3","Location: It is a bit ghetto but still centrally located.\n\nApartments: The normal 1 bedroom and multi-bedroom units are pretty standard however, the upgraded one bedroom is quite nice with a unique floor plan that I liked very much. The bedroom is tucked nicely away down a hallway from the main living area. The patio is accessible from both the bedroom and main living area. The kitchen is centrally located. The in unit washer and dryer are located right next to the spacious closet.\n\nI cannot comment on the other units but the one bedroom upgraded apartment is great.\n\nNeighbors: Neither great nor terrible in the nicer part of the apartments. It is my opinion that single people with good incomes are placed in one part of the apartments and people with children or bad incomes are placed in another but I cant say for sure it just seemed that way to me. So if you were in the nicer part the neighbors were ok. If you were in the not so nice part then the neighbors were a bit much.\n\nParking: One reserved spot but the not reserved spots are tiny and there are not enough. Have to buy your own clicker for the gate that encloses the community and it is usually in disrepair.\n\nAmenities: Pool, hot tub, free gym (Pool is in ok shape)\n\nManagement: This is where these apartments fail. The management is very friendly when you sign up but once you are in they treat you like just another apartment number. I was referred when I moved in and then they tried not to pay the referral. I fought with them for a couple weeks and they eventually paid it. My cousin lived here for years and was well aware when monthly rent was greatly reduced for new residents but they would not give him the same deal when his lease was up. \n\nAll in all it is ok because of the bad management, good single upgrade apartment layout, central location but bad neighborhood."
"3","Today is Administrative Assistant's Day, YAY, so our school's parent club took us all out to lunch here.  There were about 20 ladies all together and we arrived pretty much the second they opened.  They had a table all set up for us and ready to go.  We were immediately brought chips and salsa.\n\nThe chips were very plain, but I kept eating them.  Our bowls of chips were never empty.  We only had one girl taking care of our whole table, but after a couple rounds of refilled sodas she seemed to be getting the hang of it.  We kept her pretty busy but she handled it well.  The kitchen however, had a little difficulty and there was about a 15 minute difference between the time the first person was served and the last person.  Oh well, we all got our food and it was all correct.\n\nI ordered the cheese enchilada and chimichanga (a mini one) combination plate.  The beans that came with the dish were sprinkled with cheese and very tasty.  They were surprisingly smooth and buttery, I'm not really picky about the beans.  The enchilada was a big fat disappointment to me because there were onions inside.  I thought it would just have cheese, because everywhere else I have gone and gotten a cheese enchilada it was just plain inside.  The chimichanga was actually really good to my picky palate.  The shredded beef was flavorful and juicy.  It was also covered in cheese, and that is always a good thing in book.  I could also do without the shredded lettuce on my plate.  I'm not sure what purpose it served.\n\nOverall, it was a pretty decent experience.  The food was fine, the company was fun, and the service was pretty damn good considering our large numbers and needy ladies."
"2","ok. so i've been eating at the location on 7th ave my whole life.  decided to try the northern location.  hmm...upon entry, it looks like it used to be a chinese restaurant.  knowing los compadres isn't exactly upscale, the food is what i expected and i love their beans as i always have.  the salsa is different than the 7th ave location (at least it seemed to be) and i found that a little disappointing.\n\nthe service...was less than stupendous. \""are you ready?\""  \""do you know what you want?\""  oh and my favorite...\""do you want your check now or what?\"".\nnot, would you like dessert, are you ready for your check, would you like a box or anything like that.  completely rude.\n\nso. i'll eat there again, but i'll get it to GO."
"2","Was in town for Wrestlemania 26 and was looking for somewhere to watch Michigan St. play in the NCAA tournament, boy did we choose the wrong place... Order took forever, sat down, they mixed the wife and mines burger temperatures up! Sooooo, we had to wait some more! I ended up filling up on fries and pickles! In there defense they knew they messed up and treated our party of 10 to free desserts, which were really, really good! Kids had fun, some kid kept winning stuffed animals out of the claw game and gave them to my boys!"
"4","I love the burgers here, especially when I do a no carb diet! I love the juicy burgers and you can order whatever size you like! They also have a bison, which I love! The milkshakes are out of this world and the other desserts are yummy too. The service isn't always the greatest but its not that bad to make me not want to come back."
"2","Fuddruckers used to serve a decent buffalo burger.  Then one day they changed to lower quality meat.  Not sure when it happened, but I bit into a burger filled with that public school luncheon type meat.  Maybe they gave me the wrong patty, I dunno. My stomach hurt afterwards and I haven't been back to Fudd since then."
"4","The curious case of the disappearing review. I'm sure I've reviewed Fajita's before, but it seems to have vanished.\n\nFajita's has some spectacular lunch specials. I give them 5 full stars for their lunch, not so much for dinner (much more pricey), which some how I've determined equals out to 4 stars.\n\nSo, go there for lunch, munch on some tasty fajitas on the cheap. Being a vegetarian, I thoroughly enjoy the veggie fajitas for a mere $5. They make their own in house tortillas, which are unique and very good. They also include their tasty chips & salsa for every customer.\n\nAwesome lunch spot."
"2","The queso is ridiculously good... seriously. And the homemade tortillas are also outstanding.\n\nAside from that, everything is average at best. As mentioned by others, this is Americanized Mexican cuisine. This is not autentica comida Mexicana, mi amigos!\n\nWe had been once before and thoroughly enjoyed the food. Hence making it a point to visit again on our most recent trip to Arizona.\n\nWe started with the chips and salsa set for the table - delicious. I ordered a bunch of queso for the table, and I started with a Tortilla Soup. It was hilariously underwhelming. I made the joke that it was kitchen scraps, and it looked the part. It was light tomato broth with a bunch of vegetables, a gob of cheese and a small corn on the cob on top. Yes, a small corn on the cob is on top. It was lousy and I wouldn't recommend it.\n\nWe ordered a pound of chicken fajitas and a half pound of vegetable ones (thanks to the vegetarian fiancee). It went surprisingly far for five of us... but the veggies weren't grilled much, which is sad because they were otherwise delicious. Also, the chicken fajitas only had one piece of green pepper and one of red on top. It should be lush with peppers and onions that have been grilled or possibly even caramelized (the onions).\n\nDaniel E. wrote in his review the same concern, that there should be \""more than a pile of onions,\"" that he expected at least some green, red or yellow peppers. The fajitas were good and quite filling. The accompaniments were decent - cheese, lettuce, sour cream and the like. Nothing fancy, certainly no frills.\n\nSo much potential, but it fails on almost everything. It's a true shame. This place needs to be on Restaurant Impossible with Robert Irvine... badly...\n\nThis time around... the service was really lousy. And my fiancee found a bug deep down in her water. Very disappointing. The waitress first replied confirming what size bug it was, and then explained it and claimed that \""we're not dirty, it's just the food smell.\"" Then she apologized and walked away. We think she deducted a soda from the final bill... but nothing else. A bug!\n\nAnd the entry foyer smelled like a high school locker room... it was foul on the way in and out.\n\nSad to say that we may likely not return in the future. I'm not sure if our family and friends in the greater Phoenix area will either after the bug incident."
"1","Horrible service and food. Worst beef Enchilada I have ever had, even I know Mexican Rice doesn't have peas and corn in it, and margarita tasted like it was poured from a can. This is not considered real Mexican restaurant in my eyes. Was definitely a waste of money!!"
"1","I would never recommend this \""school\"" to anyone. The teachers are rude and unprofessional. They don't want their students to succeed. All of these teachers are the ones fired from other schools. This is no the nursing program, but I'm sure the whole school is like this. Go to a real school like asu, gcu, or the community college. This will be a waste of your time and money; two things I don't like to waste. The education is very poor. After graduating from ASU and paying a fraction of the cost it is a much better education."
"2","This hotel was busy during the weekend I visited, and at times the front desk was short staffed. Noise in the rooms from nearby I-17 was a problem. There are so many hotels in this area, I'll stay somewhere else in the future."
"2","Outback Steakhouse is alright.  They have good salads.  That's about all I can say.\n\nTheir prices are decent if you just want the basic steak meal.\n\nOverall, Meh.  I've experienced better."
"4","I usually get the sirloin,  but the fish dishes aren't bad either.  Steak is always nicely cooked,  along with the delicious side dishes.  Desserts are delicious, save some room for them. The tally nice thing is that they are consistent!"
"3","Steak was about average.  Pecan salad tasted chemically and not worth the dollar up charge.  Sweet potato was mushy.  I asked for just butter not the extra stuff.  She brought out butter and said, \""I put the cinnamon in thought you would like it.\""  So it was so so."
"2","Okay, it was a close Sushi place and I was in the mood for Sushi. So what the heck, the reviews were so-so and I thought I would give it a try. I debated for way to long on weather to just order rolls or do the AYCE method. I decided that I could just eat a couple of rolls and be happy so I ordered a couple of everyday rolls. A California Hand-roll, Philadelphia Roll and a Tootsie Roll. The Tootsie Roll was far sweeter than any Tootsie Roll I've had in the past, in fact too sweet, I think it set the stage for the rest. \n\nThe California Hand-roll was pretty good, it's pretty basic and easy enough, and it really didn't disappoint. The Philadelphia Roll is one of my favorites in general and it was okay. \n\nService was pretty slow, but everyone was very friendly and you could tell the regulars as they interacted with the staff quite a bit and really enjoyed themselves. The fact that they have regulars and are quite friendly is a testament to them. \n\nPersonally, I didn't come out of there thinking, man I have to go back it was that good. I would go back if I was eating with someone that wanted to eat there, but it won't be a place that I will necessarily recommend."
"2","It was what i expected. They packed the box on my two item meal."
"2","I came here because I was craving Chinese and didn't feel like going to Panda Express. Wanted something quick and close, and I've eaten here one other time, so I gave it a shot.  \n\nThe food is okay, and the place try's to present itself like a Panda express.  They have crab Rangoon, and it's set up where you can get a variety of different things. The food is okay and the prices are good, but the last time I came here the service was awful.  The guy was filling to go orders while a line grew like 5 people long. I didn't mind, but he was sorta crabby when he waited on me and I had to tell him I wanted orange chicken like 3 times.\n\nThe food was okay, but nothing spectacular.  He also had a hard time making change when he rang up my order.  My bill was $6.77, so I gave him $10.02 so I could get $3.75 back. He was confused and tried to say something back to me.  The other lady working came and helped him figure out how to ring up my order.  I don't mean to suggest that he's stupid, but after his crappy demeanor, and now he can't figure out change, maybe waiting on people isn't the best idea for him.\n\nOverall it was okay. With all the light rail construction, I went here because it's literally across the street from my apartment, and I wanted something quick. If you want better Chinese, go to panda express.  The food isn't bad, it's just not great...and questionable service as well."
"2","The hotel has been \""Rode Hard & Put Away Wet\"".  If your room faces Dunlap or I-17 (half the room) then be prepared for the Harley lullaby at 3 in the morning.\n\nThe bathroom could use a makeover, discolored tiles, missing grout, just poor upkeep. This is not the Motel 4 1/2 but it has the feel.\n\nThe meeting rooms where past their prime during the Bush era, Bush 1. \n\nCharging for the Internet is so low.  I have stayed in some cheap hotel chains that don't charge. \n\nThe parking garage is from the front and the elevators.  You have pull you bags up the stairs if you use the side entrance closes to the garage.\n\nIt is the great staff that it gets this hotel moved up to a two star."
"2","Disappointing...no heat in the room, pet stains on the carpet, sink backed up....and no one answered the phone when I tried to report these issues. On the other hand, as mentioned below, Steve the bartender continues to provide an exemplary level of service that used to be the norm at the Crescent."
"1","My boyfriend, his 13 year old brother & I were in Arizona for a baseball tournament. When we first arrived to the Sheraton we thought that it seemed to be a nice hotel. We were booked to stay here one night. After we checked in we went straight to the water-slide & hung out for a bit. When we were finally ready to go back up to the room we showered & got ready for bed. When my boyfriend and I lifted up the blankets to get tucked in, I jumped so far off the bed & he immediately wanted to know what was wrong... THERE WAS BLOOD that was obviously not ours on the white comforter. We called the front desk right away & my boyfriend spoke to a woman about the incident and she said they would send up housekeeping to change the sheets. My boyfriend then asked what else they could do for us because this is unacceptable. She told him that she would see what they could do and she'd call back in a few minutes. About 10 minutes later housekeeping knocked on the door and changed the sheets (she was just as horrified as we were) and then offered us some clean towels. So we didn't hesitate and took the clean towels. The next morning we woke up to shower and get ready for check out. When I got out of the shower I was going to use my towel from the night before until I remembered the housekeeper had brought us clean ones. So I grabbed a clean towel and unraveled it to dry off only to find... MORE DRIED BLOOD! I was furious. When we checked out I mentioned something to the gentleman at the front desk about the incident the night before (since they said they'd call back and never did) and his reaction was that he was already aware of everything. So then I mentioned what had happened with the \""clean towel\"" also & his response was \""That is definitely not one of our standards.\"" I have stayed at plenty of hotels throughout my life & I have never once experienced something so vile and received such poor customer service. Nothing was done to compensate us for the incidents."
"3","I don't stay at Sheratons very often. Never been a big fan. I stayed here because it was the best hotel in the area given I was using points on this rare occasion. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. I understand from my friends who live in Phoenix that the hotel is situated in a fairly seedy part of town. However, if you stay within the hotel and not walk around the area I think it is fine.\nMy room was very nice for the points and supplemental price I paid. I had a lovely view of the pool which I visited during my stay. The pool was good. The only suggestion I have is that it should have been serviced by someone to pick up glasses and such left on the tables so someone else could use them.\nFor lunch I had room service which was the fish tacos. I think that was the best meal I have ever had in room service. At a Sheraton in Phoenix! Amazing. I had dinner that evening at the hotel with a friend of mine. This was on Saturday, October 25th. The service we received was so disappointing. The food was fine but our server could not have been more lackluster. I would also say that was the case with the bellmen who took my bags at check in. I have never had anyone to be in such a hurry (it wasn't busy at all) that they had to take the bags before I even finished the check in process. It would have been nice if he had waited and walked up with me and showed the features of the room. I had the occasion to see him later and mention my thoughts and it was clear this was a nice young kid who had never been properly trained.\nOverall, I would say this hotel is a solid 3. Much better than I had expected. I would stay here again."
"3","OK the toilet was hooked up to a hot water supply line! Flush before you sit and get a nice ass(face)ial!  OMG! Well that gives a whole new meaning to STEAMING pile of.............nevermind.\r\n\r\nFor under 100 bucks per night I got a nice room with a mini kitchen including full sized refrigerator and dishwasher. The bedroom had a work desk, free WiFi and a wide screen TV!\r\nThey were nice enough NOT to decorate in the 80's Southwest style instead going for a semi-Cape Cod look.\r\n\r\nThe pool, wide screen and mini kitchen were nice but the highlight  here is the free breakfast. They have a do it yourself Belgian waffle station! One more reason to get up an (MTN) hour early!\r\n\r\nI hate hotel the motel but this place was nice.\r\n\r\nThanks Tommy T. for letting me have two waffles for the road trip home ;)"
"4","The best conference facilities I have been to in Phoenix.  Parking can get tight as another poster mentioned, but I think that is unavoidable.  The food is fantastic and they have snacks and drinks available during the day.  I don't like the tiny cups & water jugs to drink from.  I understand eliminating plastic bottles, but the cups they provide are too small.  Really a minor inconvenience though."
"5","We discovered this place by accident and have used it for the last 2 years.  Feri is the new owner having bought it from Nati.  Feri is a very quiet soft spoken lady,  great seamstress, not very entrepeneurial (good for clients) and a push over if you are going to haggle (please don't) we also want her to stay in business and keep her kind demeanor.  Over the last two years, we have had her hem countless pairs of slacks and for $10-12 ea, had her sew custom furniture covers  and shade cloth for outdoor area.   For any sort of custom work,  we think the pricing is very fair. The regular work like hemming is a low as it should go.  For the customer who was complaining about the price alteration on their $50 pair of pants for semi custom work, what are you expecting?  You do semi custom work on designer clothes/suits or gowns or you have a sentimental attachment to a piece of clothing else its not worth it."
"4","During my mercado shopping day this week my husband was craving Mariscos ala Mexico and our pal Tom knew just the place. This little hole in the wall has all the right signs as you walk in the clientele is made up  of a wide slice of phoenix from  your  people on office lunch breaks , abuelas  with their famillias  and average types like myself.  We ordered seafood inspired Mexican food like shrimp enchiladas  , fish tacos (good but nothing to start a talk thread about )  and sopa de mariscos ..very tasty!   The chips were very fresh and the guacamole and salsas mucho yummo.     word of warning they put a jalepeno butter on just about every entree, for those that dont know oil  spreads the heat in peppers ..so your food is spicy!\nI will definitely be back again  to try the sopa again ."
"3","It's like the cliche Mexican grill. Large tables.  Cheesy decor.  Beer promos everywhere.  At least at Las Glorias, the food actually tasted good.  \n\nThey bring you liquidy salsa and chips to start.  I had a burrito with rice and beans.  This place is a solid 3 stars, but since this is AZ Las Glorias Grill is 3.5 stars.  It really is hard to find decent Mex place there."
"2","I've been here a few times with my mom because she really likes it, but overall I wasn't impressed.  The food was tasty, but the service was atrocious.\n\nIt was busy the last time we went, but we stood around inside the door for probably 10 minutes before an employee even noticed us.  There were other parties waiting, too.  You just had to stand around and wait for someone to bother seating you in one of the open booths.\n\nEveryone was satisfied with their meal.  I've had the spinach tacos, which were very tasty, and I appreciate having a veggie option that wasn't a run-of-the-mill bean and cheese or chile relleno.  (I've had their chile relleno and wasn't impressed by it.)  But no one refilled our drinks the whole time or checked on us.  Not even once. \n\nMaybe this is better when you go at a less busy time, but the food isn't mindblowing enough to make it worth the lousy service on a Friday night."
"5","They tried to kill me, and I love them for it.  \n\nWhen a company posts a wing challenge usually covertly by  using terms fire, insanity,suicide or death wings I have to try it.Nearly every place using those terms in the valley are liars. If it's a chain restaurant Suicide wings =  a penguin's dangly bits. \n\nI am one of those idiots that frequents hot-sauce forums, sites and other places where my legal high can be obtained or discussed with those similarly afflicted so I took them up on the $15 challenge to eat 10 in 10 minutes, prize for 2 hours of speaking in tongues and humming a Johnny Cash tune?  Picture on wall and T-shirt plus not having to do it again:) The wings are caked in a habanero reduction that is more a  volume of heat eaten rather than insanely hot. Try it.It's awesome way to spend  20-30 minutes:D \n\nThankfully they have more affordable, livable, Zombie wings for those times you have enough T Shirts in your wardrobe but still need that kick. Their Hellzapoppin burger is rather good too.  Nice people,been in several times and orders have been quick, hot, correct and the food is a great value for money. 5/5  purely on heat  4/5  on food..5/5 value  So 4.7 stars rounded up:)"
"1","The whole service was awful! We got seated and it took about 15 min to get our drinks ordered, then they had the dishwasher, chef, waiters and the manager all taking orders. When the food was delivered about 30 min later one of our orders was wrong and the other was burnt also the table next to us had the same issue. And in the end when we went to pay they didn't have change so they asked myself if I had change for a dollar and when I said no the poor waitress had to use her own tips to give out change to the customers! Never again will I go there"
"4","These guys rock. I needed to get a new fan motor for my heatpump and they checked around and got me a good price on one. When I showed up to pay for it, one of them actually drove to the place they were ordering it from and picked it up for me so I could have it that day. They were also offering to give me a free capacitor for it, but it wasn't necessary.\n\nOnly negatives: I waited a full week after telling them to go ahead and order it because they never mentioned that I'd have to pay up-front. Simple miscommunication.\n\nNOTE: their hours on Yelp are not currently accurate; they close at 4:30pm."
"1","I am so sad to say this is the worst customer service place ever. I went there a couple of times when they were on Dunlap and they were always cold and very unfriendly.\n\nI do not know why they were so cold.  They did not say hi to me and they said hello to my husband when he walked in way after me because he was parking the car,  I told my husband to stop there to see  what they had.  It was my idea.  I walked in smiling and made eye contact by nothing.  I wanted to spend money there. They greeted and welcomed my husband but not me?  I was dressed well.   The only difference was is my husband is not Hispanic.  The last three times I was there it happened each time. I walked out and will not  go there again.  Sad."
"4","I have been coming to this Goodwill since I moved over here into my house back in 2010. This place get's me everytime! Especially on 50% off Saturdays. I have bought more purses, household items, books, picture frames, etc than I probably should have, but the prices just can't be beat. Heck I even got two stools for a total of $14. If you happen to be in the area check this place out. On 50% off Saturdays, it get's really crazy, but you get some great stuff for EXTRA cheap!"
"5","Went here because my feet were painful and I just could not find comfortable shoes. The staff was very knowledgable and helped me pick out some great shoes and an orthotic to help with my foot problem. In 2 weeks my feet feel great and I will never go any where else for my feet and shoe needs."
"4","Ok, here's the thing.....I grew up in Cleveland, Ohio eating Polish, German and Slovenian meat & sausage.  Best places back home to buy this kind of thing are on 185th Street, the ethnic \""hood.\""   Moving to Phoenix meant lots of sunshine, no snow and no sausage like I was used to.  The closest I could find to home was Stanley's on Bell Road.  They have a wonderful selection and the girls smile every time I go in and ask, \""Now how do you pronounce that?\""  My favorite is the rice sausage that's made with liver.  It is in a ring and bakes up great in the oven!  Short of making a trip back to Cleveland & 185th Street or the West Side Market, this is GOOD STUFF!   Do I shop there all the time?  Nope, but it's definitely the place to go to stock up for ethnic holiday types of meals, especially at Easter and Christmas time.  \n\nI stopped at Shreiner's last week on my way home from work and was a little dissappointed.  They were out of a lot of stuff, didn't even seem familiar with my favorites, but the young girl working there was very nice.  She told me they don't make the type of sausage I was looking for, but suggested I try some Brats.   Not exactly what I wanted, but I decided to try some. They were okay, but for the really good, authentic ethnic sausage I love, I'll keep going to Stanley's!"
"5","Surprise this place doesn't have many reviews . Place stays busy.so on with my review . Well all I can say is there service is at perfection to me . I've heard and experience the horror storys that happens going to the wrong dry cleaners . Trust me that won't happen hear ."
"1","I don't always take time to write a review but when I do, it' is usually: for an exceptionally good or  poor service. Unfortunately, this time it is the latter. Being from California, I came to Auto Air & Electric by referral from someone I got to know locally. This person has been in the auto field for a long time and recommended AA&E as people with knowledge, experience  and integrity. Raving reviews on Yelp provided further assurance that it would be the right place to have my Mazda 626's  problem fixed and without hesitation I went to the shop. Upon walking in, I stumbled into Mike at the desk. Mentioning the name of the referring party did not seem to make much of an impression and I proceeded describing my problem. The issue at hand was a non-working A/C system. Most places I had taken the car to for estimates kept looking in the wrong direction and were inclined to think that it was a faulty compressor. A friend who works on cars out of his garage was nice enough to do a great deal of preliminary testing and conclusively ruled it out. Everything was pointing to an electric system.  It must be noted that I came to the shop not exactly as a first time novice with an attitude \""The car has a problem, please fix it\"".  I had some grasp of the issue, had done some \""homework\"" and just needed to establish the missing link. I felt that with the information I provided AA&E and with their level of expertise it would be a slam dunk. Judging from Mike's lack of interest of  my preliminary findings, I understood he was  keen at tackling the problem from the bottom up. This approach may have its merits, but I felt, and my feeling was later affirmed, that many of the steps they intentionally or unintentionally took were unnecessary as they had duplicated steps taken by my friend. The repair was started with the basic inspection ($40) which I predicted would not be productive use of time, but Mike insisted it was the right way to do it. 30 min. later he peeked inside to get an approval for the next step up ($125) a more thorough examination. After nearly 5 hours in the shop and $290 lighter (a repair of a short circuited wire bundle, something I had known about, had to be made in the process) I was being told that possibly a relay ($75 special order item) was causing the issue. I was to leave the car in the shop as the part would arrive the next day. Extremely disappointed, to say the least, with the growing costs and no end in sight, I declined and left. Soon after I returned to California and was fortunate to have found a not so fancy shop in one of the industrial areas of LA. Armed with information I provided him, the Spanish speaking mechanic, despite poor command of English quickly got a grasp of the problem and in 45 min. cracked the puzzle. Cherry on the icing was the fact that he charged me only $50 for labor. No parts had to be ordered. None of the \""let's do preliminary diagnostic\"" BS. He tinkered with the car and charged me for producing  an actual result rather than an hourly rate while just going through the motions. Based on my overall experience, I feel this rating  would be the most appropriate."
"5","I moved to the Phoenix area again in 1999. I have been looking for a real barber since. The great Johnny Gibson in Tucson cut my hair for years. \n\nI found the place, it is here and Jimmy is the dude. I asked for my regular haircut, 2 taper on sides, a little off the top, no spikes, blocked in back. Jim cut my hair to those specs. Never ran the clippers into my scalp, worked quick and efficiently. He then trimmed the brows, ears and nose. Finished with washing my hair. Excellent.\n\nAfter he had already started, I realized that it was a cash only business. Jimmy handled the fact that I did not have any with grace. I walked across to Circle K, purchased a coke and got a twenty spot for Jim. 16 dollar cut with a tip. Excellent value, service and conversation. \n\nClose to my work, I will be returning monthly."
"5","Jimmy was personable and considerate of what I requested. Not only did I receive a great haircut and beard trim, I also received great conversation and a new connection. I definitely recommend Zev's if you wish to receive great treatment at a good price. It even comes with a wash and rinse. Oh, and the vibration shoulder massage at the end was quite the kicker! Loved the experience."
"4","Excellent good fresh and delicious with many choices at a great price.  You get it made your way with many different choices of meats cheeses and toppings. Thru also have pastas but I recommend subs they are better."
"5","I had the best customer service from Eric in the fan department today! Thank you for all your help Eric, you helped me more than you can imagine. I appreciate your customer service. Hopefully I'll see you again for more goodies! Your co workers were exceptionally helpful as well!!!"
"4","I am a gringo from Detroit but like my carne asada.... I cannot speak or read Spanish but they are always more then willing to help me out. The meat is always good and the tortillas fresh. I have never seen bugs but hell I had on in my office today. It happens. \n\nThe shelves are packed but I never looked around."
"1","TERRIBLE PLACE!! HORRIBLE FOOD!!! Bell Rd & 23rd ave. They got our take out order wrong, then we found a nasty hair in the food. We called the manager to let him know and he was in complete denial and said he could not do anything about that on a take order. This place is not clean inside and is a complete rip off! Don't waste your time or money."
"2","Went to Caramba's for dinner.  This was our first time and we went on the recommendation of friends.\n\nFirst impressions.  When we walked in, about a 1/2 dozen tables were occupied.  The restaurant was VERY clean.  Lots of tables, no kitsch decor, and an order/pick up at the counter type set up.   \n\nThe lady at the counter was friendly and took our order w/ no problems.  We asked about ordering chips (they are listed on the on-line menu), and the lady said they were included, and gave us a couple of bowls of chips along w/ our drink cups.\n\nThey have a salsa bar with several different salsas available.  Medium smooth (hot sauce), medium chunky, hot, fire roasted, and pico de gallo.\n\nThe fire roasted salsa and the medium smooth were good, but nothing special.  The chips however, were well past their prime (stale).\n\nWe ordered a #2 combo plate (2 hard beef tacos), #6 combo plate (red chile burrito), and a bean and cheese burrito.\n\nThe food came fast and hot.  That's about the only good things I can say.  The red chile burro had a lot of meat and grease, but no flavor.  The red chile it self was very thin and watery.  The rice was bland.  The beans had the flavor of being fresh out of a can.  The tacos were also packed w/ meat, once again without flavor.  The same bland rice and beans accompanied the tacos.\n\nMy son ate about 1/2 of the bean and cheese burrito, and didn't want to take the rest home, and I didn't blame him.  He's pretty easy to please when it comes to a bean and cheese burritos, and he didn't like the beans either.\n\nMaybe if we would have had one of their margaritas or cheap beer that many people rave about we would have liked it more.\n\nI would rate almost any of \""berto\"" places above Caramba when it comes the the flavor of the food.  I would rather have traveled down Bell Road to Mixteca.\n\nMy advice, if you want fresh, tasty, fast Mexican food.  Go to the nearest Carolinas.\n\nI'm giving 2 stars, the restaurant was spotless, and the iced tea was fresh and very good."
"3","I remember when this place was on the corner of 19th Ave and Tbird.  Ive been coming here that long.  Seems like the last few times I have been in here it appears that the prices have gone up or is it just me?  Otherwise I enjoy coming here as the employees are always willing to help me find what I am looking for or check another location for me."
"2","Don't get me wrong with the two stars.  I still love Barro's...but this location left something for my tummy to desire...like actual pizza.  After walking down the long miles of Fry's Electronics, it was lunch time and I needed sustenance.\n\nWhat better place to get it than Barro's with their slice lunch special?  Unfortunately the only slices they had - at prime lunch hour - was pepperoni and a dried sad lone slice of veggie.  At prime lunch hour.  I was one of four patrons at that point and everyone wanted sausage.\n\nIf I wanted my yummy Barro's sausage pizza, I would've had to wait 15, maybe even 25 minutes.   At prime lunch hour.\n\nUnnnnggghhh...tummy hurting.\n\nNo thanks sucky Barro Thunderbird location.  Boo to you.  :(\n\nMaybe....and I mean MAYBE if I'm in the area I may try this one place again, but for now you did no service to my poor stomach."
"1","I HATE JACK IN THE CRACK...the only time I can eat here is if I've been drinking and everyone in the car is craving it. Not like I got a say I never drink and drive :) so when we all pull up my drunken ass orders something. \n\nTHIS PARTICULAR jack just is horrible!!!! The past 3 times!!! Drinks get mixed up...fries are missing...tomatos are there when they shouldn't...foods cold...forget my sauce for the eggrolls :( ya don't judge i tried the eggrolls and they were horrible and dry. And it's really hard to make eggrolls taste bad ,but jack in the box sure was able to do it."
"2","Burgers suck and small, gyros o.k., italian beef chewy, sandwich dry even if you get it wet, and nothing special about the dogs... Chicago dogs? C'mon .. I'm from the north suburbs and never had a dog with mustard prepared on top of the relish. UHG!!!"
"4","Great location to soak up some drink before you go home to pass out. \n\nThe staff can be nice or rude depending on you. (I prefer rude) \nThe food is good, nothing pretentious or assuming. You get what they give you and you eat it. \n\nI don't think I would bring Mom for Sunday Breakfast but for a quick bite, it hits the spot. Better then Denny's unless you want your Superbird or French Toast. \n\nThe waitress was even nice enough to call a cab for us."
"5","We were greeted at the door by a young lady letting me know it would be a 20 min wait for a booth.  The place is a bit small and looks like it may fit about 100?\n\nOnce inside Angel greeted us with our menus. \n\nFood came to us QUICK!! \n\nWe had:\n\nPeanut butter waffle - it's peanut butter chips melted on waffles. yum!!\nPlain waffle - butter n maple syrup soooo good!\nTexas eggs and bacon sandwich was delicious\nScrambled eggs - plain variety\nEggs over medium - PERFECTLY MADE!! \nGrits - kinda clumpy\nHashbrowns - processed, but none the less fine\nCoffee - great cup of cafe Java\n\nAngel is an awesome server, though the cashier mentioned she from another House... Just helping out here as most of their crew is in Vegas for a wedding.  They need to snatch Angel up! She was super busy but still kept up with checking in on us.   Everyone there is so friendly!\n\nI literally walked out with a smile from the great experience.  Talk about starting the morning off right! :)"
"2","I chose this restaurant based on the ratings in Yelp... that proved to be a mistake.  I'm baffled as to why other raters gave this place such a thumbs up.\n\nIt is indeed small and plain-- to the point of being distressed.  The sidewalk leading up to the restaurant was spotted with the prehistoric remains of past masticated chewing gum.  The handle of the front door was sticky.  \n\nInside there was a very small and dingy dining room decorated in \""early depression\"".  There was a small, short, serving area featuring about 10 to 12 entrees, none of which were appetizing.  I tried a little of everything on the line and I have nothing nice to say about any of it.  The chicken and fish were so breaded that I can't honestly say I ever encountered any meat inside for which the dish was named. When I pushed on one of the pieces of sesame chicken with a fork, a thick, oily fluid oozed out of the breading.  The few vegetables available were limp and over cooked.  The egg drop soup was tasteless and the meatballs may have been made of packing foam.\n\nTo be fair, I can't say that this was the worst Chinese buffet my wife and I have ever encountered... but it did make the bottom ten list.\n\nYes the employees are friendly and the prices are very reasonable... but then, I guess you get what you pay for; so if your budget is restricted and your expectations aren't very high this would be the place for you to fill the void in your gut.  If you are looking for flavor and a dining experience, I think you would have better luck in an inner city soup kitchen."
"4","I grew up eating here so i really like it and the atmosphere is cozy I really like it."
"5","I chose this restaurant based on fellow yelp reviewers. My friend missed Mexican food he used to eat in San Diego, so I looked around and trying to find the closest I can find to what he is used to in San Diego.\n\nI liked the decoration inside the restaurant and patio looked very inviting.  Waiter was friendly and took our order right away.  \n\nSalsa was very tasty.  We ended up eating two bowls of them with chips.  We ordered shrimp picante, seafood enchilada, fish tacos. All were good, cannot decided which was my favorite.  For desert, we had fried ice cream (free for a birthday boy), flan, and apple pie on hot skillet.  Everything was so tasty, price was reasonable, great atmosphere, good service.  I will definitely come back again when I want to eat good Mexican food."
"5","Incredible all the way around. I have worked in the industry for years and I have to say, Wallace provided some of the best service I've ever received. Very personable and friendly. He made my wife and I feel right at home. \n\nAnd the food. My goodness. I had the tampiqueno dinner, my wife had the #2 combo (beef and sour cream enchilada and shredded need taco). They were perfection. My steak was a beautiful medium rare, just like I had asked for, and the chips and salsa were ON POINT!! I would highly recommend this restaurant to any lover of Mexican cuisine. 5 stars all the way."
"1","My wife saw this restaurant on DDD and has been wanting to go for a long time.  My kids and I finally gave in.  The restaruant was clean.  There were two tables filled.  My youngest ordered chincken wings, which took 45 minutes.  Oh, by the way, we all had finished eating already.  I ordered the nachos grande, which had cold meat, cold cheese (not melted) and watery guacamole.  My other kids and wife all ordered beef chinmichangas, which my oldest asked if the meat was meat.  She my son asked if he would trade his chimi for my nachos, which I reluctantly did.  The chimi was vile.  I would rather have skipped that meal and gone right to bed.  Would never go again and hope the staff member at DDD who found this place gets reassigned to a desk job."
"5","I wasn't even hungry but ate a burrito, chips and salsa and a combo platter. That's how good the food was! \n\nMy cousin, who lives in Anthem, mentioned that Roberto's had been on Food Network. There was no line, luckily, and I was ready to wait for the food. \n\nI ate the carnitas platter and the carne asada burrito. Wow they're tasty. And I loved seeing all the beers on ice at the counter."
"4","Food is very good, the owners are very friendly.  I would have given them a 5-star however it typically takes 10-20 minutes to get your food (and this is simple mexican food), secondly they don't have free chips & salsa.  Their Texax Burrito and the Al Pastor plate are both very good."
"4","Recently renovated. Very effective and well-flowing floor plan. The section for well behaved children and brats is located on the complete other side of the building from the rest of the library. Genius!"
"1","I came here one day looking for a new nail salon closer to home. This place was less than a mile away from my front door and I was really hoping it was a diamond in the rough! I walked in and the salon was empty and there were two ladies working there. Both ladies were very nice and super friendly! I picked out a color for my pedicure and took a seat (not many color options but I've seen worse). They started to ask me questions and make small talk about what my husband and I do for work and if we have kids etc. She also asked me if I wanted any upgrades like a sugar scrub or callous remover. Everytime I try out a new place and they ask me if I want to add a service I almost always do because I like to see what places have to offer.I agreed to get the callous remover and then she told me it would be an additional $10 which seemed like a lot to me but if she's charging double what most people do I assume her service is better in some way so I went along with it. She also asked me if I wanted a flower and I said no thank you because I honestly really think they're tacky and just prefer a regular pedicure. As I'm watching the news and not really paying attention she's painting away and all is good. She tells me shes finished, I look down and see a big yellow flower with glitter and a rhinestone on my big toe. She told me it was a gift and there was no charge.   At that point I just decided it wasn't worth the trouble of asking her to take them off so I paid and left. After all of that it came out to $35 with tip. Out of curiosity I called today to ask how much a pedicure is with a callous remover and to my surprise it was $20 for a pedicure and only $5 for the callous remover. Interesting... I can't help to think that I was charged extra based off of the questions she asked me. I also think that if someone says they don't want a certain service they should respect that. Thanks anyway!"
"1","Well rude staff. Kitchen was dirty.  Waitress forgot my drink...twice and  the bun looked wrinkles and smashed, won't be back for sure."
"1","Just barely sat in,  at least 10 servers and was not helped out for a long time. Finally got my order in and  staff is not happy at all. Will most likely be the last time I come here."
"2","Eric said \"" Best haircuts in North Phoenix \"" but he forgot to include, \""if you like bruises and whiplash\"". I came to this place once and never came back. \n\nThis place is fu**ing dark, creepy and downright scary. So i took a seat in the barbers chair and he went to work. This guy beat the living hell out of my head. I left there with scratches and bruises! I will admit, the fade was great ( Hence the additional star), but too bad my fu**ing head looked like i got into a fight with a wild Cheetah to enjoy it."
"4","Price is the same as going to Cost Cutters during the haircut sale day - so save the $ and go here. Its a well-appointed shop, nicely furnished and they offer all the traditional barber services. No appointments necessary. I'd go back. Conversation is non-existent, but that's okay by me!\n\nAlso - the sign on the window says they buy gold...ummm...okay."
"3","Recently I started going to this Costco when the Business Center stopped selling cigarettes for personal consumption and left this as the only Costco in the West valley that sells cigarettes.  I don't like the layout as well as Arrowhead and because it is out of the way for me I quite often end up going here during busy times instead of weekday evenings when things are a bit quieter.  I just stopped by the morning before Thanksgiving and the place looked like a Saturday afternoon 10 minutes after opening.  And the system for cigarettes places a burden on the rest of the customers who do not smoke by making the entire line wait for somebody to go get the cigarettes.  I'll still keep coming to this one when I need to but I will go to Arrowhead for restocking stuff in the pantry, like the Langers OJ which this location did not have when I looked for it."
"4","The only beef I have about Costco is this; PLEASE add a little fitting room!! I wanted to buy a swimsuit and all women know you have to try 20 on to find one that fits decent. When I asked if I could try it on in the restroom, I was told I had to BUY it first.. Does this make sense? So now I have a \""too small\"" swimsuit that I need to drive all the way back to return..ugh.."
"5","I love Sardella's!! they have great pizza and the winds are great!! they also have a killer monday special (half price pizza!)  this wings are so good they will make you wanna smack your momma!!"
"2","Wings and pizza is good, but pricey. Their customer service is the worst if they made your meal wrong. Make it difficult to get it fixed especially if it was delivered they make you drive to their location to get your correct order. Also they send out mailers with the specials but when you call they say it is no longer available at that price, although I just got it in the mail that day.   So their food is good but not great for the prices, and I heard they just hiked their prices again. Was a customer for some time but with all the bad experiences will not be going back."
"1","I was charged $65 to remove and reinstall a tonneau cover while having the bed sprayed. Manufacturer quotes less than 30 minutes, but it is closer to 10-15 to install. The cover was reinstalled incorrectly by the LineX tech. I would expect the technician to know what he is doing if they are charging that much."
"3","Good place - it really helps I can walk here because, I probably would never come otherwise. Don't get me wrong - it's an interesting place - food is good - but, overall it's a dive you go to for a night cap. \n\nNot very family friendly. The new patio is over-crowded with smokers and you have to walk right by it to the front door...unless you know to use the back. It's not like they don't want families here - it's just not the best place for young ones (unless they are into looking at stuffed animal heads)\n\nI know my review doesn't sound too good however, I'd say give 'em a shot and try for yourself. I live pretty close and maybe go once a year - and ten years ago it was once or twice a month so....I think I just found better places to spend a buck."
"1","The picture of a stacked cheesesteak sandwich on the wall is a bait and switch. When i got my sandwich the amount of meat was a joke. I complained to deaf ears.\nThis was my last trip to Charleys. Go to Luke's of Chicago, get the combo. Its worth the money and delicious"
"2","The food is good that's why we come here but we will be finding a new one to go to every time we come the staff is unprofessional messing around  yelling across the store to one another 2 different visits they were cursing one time they were complaining about another guest and they always have the same Spanish soap opera on the tv I thought this was a family friendly place"
"1","absolutely dreadful. mac grill has been awful for awhile, but only went for daughters 13 birthday (her choice-her day)\n\nservice was rotten, i had some whole wheat fettucine dish that had no sauce and was god-awful. 2 vodka/soda drinks were a joke and if not for a birthday, would've created a scene. place was dead and there is a reason for that. after dinner, 8 min wait for a dessert with 3 tables occupied! really?\n\nnext time chef boyardee out of a can. this place is for suckers."
"3","Food: Edible. Not great. I got the Pasta Sampler and it seemed like it spent a little to long under a heat lamp. The prosciutto mac n cheese was the highlight. The rest not so great. My wife got the chicken parmesan. She thought it was alright.  Kind of expensive for what you get also.  \n\nAmbiance: Pretty cool. My daughter had a great time drawing on the \""tablecloth\"". \n\nService: Excellent. Casey (KC?) was great. He was the only thing that saved this place from 2 stars. \n\nOverall it wasn't bad enough to not go back but not good enough to make the regular rotation."
"1","Service was terrible.  It started when I asked for a different table and the hostess said no. That should have been my clue.  The food was tasteless.  I have ordered the shrimp portofino several times previous.  I always thought it was good.  But tonight it was awful. I'll never come here again."
"1","Terrible service!!!!  Food was ok, but don't think we will be back.  They left a empty dirty salad bowl on our table for more than half an hour, gross!  Many servers and managers walked by with no notice of dirty dishes on tables,  we had to box up our own food,  and at no time did anyone offer me a second glass of wine!  Fail!!!  They also sat two well dressed adults in the kiddie section, really?!?!  It was not busy, early in the evening, and a full staff.  There is no excuse for such terrible service!  I wish I had  read the other reviews before we ate here.   After all these bad reviews you would think their corporate would get a clue or they just don't care either!   Lazy and apathetic is no way to go through life."
"3","The bread is pretty good. The Italian bake was too watery for my taste. The meat balls were decent and the sausage was ok. A fairly inexpensive meal and you get what you pay for. The crayons and paper tablecloth are a nice touch, nothing better than a paper cut at dinner."
"2","Meh .. staff is very short assy but overall clean.. what do you expect it's Mc Donalds not Deluxe Burger at the Biltmore... place is dated I rarely eat here kids had gift cards from Christmas....management needs to look closely at this location"
"3","I was craving something last night and couldn't figure out what I wanted. I happened to stumble across this place and decided to give it a try. I ordered the house fried rice and some crab rangoon. Now the crab rangoon were pretty good and I was actually bummed that you only got four but it was only about $2.50 so I cannot complain too much. The fried rice was just ok. For it to be house friend rice, which comes with beef, chicken, pork and shrimp, I can understand not having alot of the shrimp but it didn't have much of anything. I mean it tasted ok, but I was hoping for a little bit more meat than there was. It was a quick meal considering I didn't really know what I wanted to eat anyway. I may give it another try and hope that it's a little better next time."
"1","Ordered a pizza for the first time. The tomato taste was so overbearing that you could not taste anything else. Better off going to Little Ceasars."
"1","Holy cow, worst customer service ever. We ordered two premium wraps through the drive through. Took about 20 mins and we were the only people there. We could here the employees screaming at each other whole making our order. Won't come here again!"
"3","We have a problem every time we go to Claim Jumper. I'm ready to give up. Last night I got the Grilled Chicken Pasta. They forgot to put the sauce on. It was supposed to have garlic olive oil on it. I told the server and he said he would bring it on the side. What he brought was not garlic olive oil, it was water based with lots of seasoning. So I went ahead and used it and it was not good. Only ate half the dish. We ordered the brownie for dessert. It is NOT a brownie, it's a piece of cake. I don't know if they ran out of brownies, or that's their brownie. But we were very disappointed with that. We ordered extra ice cream to go with it. That came separately just as we finished the dessert - thanks. On previous  visits to this location we've had to return dishes because they're barely warm, etc. Something every time. The only reason we come here is because we get gift cards..."
"3","Portions are huge! There is no way anyone should eat a full meal here. I'd say as far as quality they are average. Great happy hour prices."
"1","Food - WAY OVER PRICED and not as good as you would expect with the prices. We ordered an appetizer sampler. The brought us potato skins that were still frozen in the middle, we asked for them to take them back and they did and when they brought them back they were burnt. My friend ordered a steak and asked that it be done Medium Well and when it came it was so rare it was practically mooing. \n\nDrinks - Decent but nothing to rave about. \n\nService - Poor. Our wait staff was over whelmed by their section and was running around like a chicken with his head cut off. I understand that environments like that can cause this but I have seen worse and he should have been able to handle it. The management that came and talked to us was rude and a bit snarky. We were spending over $130 in the establishment and he acted as though we were an inconvenience since we were not happy with the appetizer or one of the drinks we had ordered. When my friend explained that her steak was not cooked enough he did offer to take it back and have it recooked but by that time that had taken place she had lost her appetite.\n\nAtmosphere - Best part of the experience.\n\nAfter being spoken to the way the manager spoke to us I can safely say I will NEVER return to this Claim Jumper. For the amount of money we spent that night I would have at least expected some common courtesy."
"4","I normally hold off on writing reviews for chain places but I met up with some girlfriends for lunch on a Sunday that wanted to hear about my trip and they said let's do lunch at Claim Jumpers, so off I went.\n\nWe were seated right away by the manager, who was very friendly & nice and our server for the meal was Vanessa, and let me tell you Vanessa loves her job she was superb job, she is what inspired me to write this review. From the start of the meal to the end of the meal she was present thoughtful and helpful even offered us some tea to go when we left. \n\nI was in the mood for a salad so I went with bbq chicken salad it was perfectly prepared but it visually it looked amazing, the greens, the red of the tomato so vivid in color, and the best part it tasted great too!\n\nI can honestly say that I haven't been to a Claim Jumpers in a few years and I am happy that I did that Sunday afternoon! Great company, great food, excellent service."
"1","Food prepared wrong. Charged for things that we supposed to be complimentary as per our waitress, including entrees and deserts. Not going back to this place!! Manager said she would fix things but didn't."
"5","Chris handled my car at Phoenix Body Works and they did a great job.  I needed a front quarter panel and headlight replaced due to an accident and when I got it back it looked brand new; even better than when I dropped it off.  The paint color matched perfectly.  Chris and everyone else in the office was very friendly and answered all of my questions.\n\nIn addition to the great body work the car had been vaccuumed out for me when I got it back.  What a nice surprise!  They also provided me with a small bottle of touch-up paint in case I got any more paint chips in the future."
"5","Excellent job!  Originally went to take a friend and was so impressed with that work that I had them do mine.  Will go back and refer friends.  Chris is friendly, professional and thorough. Car looks great!!!!"
"4","I have been eating here regularly for lunch. Their Chicken \""Country House Salad\"" lunch combo is a very good deal.\n\n$5.99 for a decent sized salad with grilled chicken and mixed greens and a baked potato or soup.\n\nSince it is summer here, I do not like to eat heavy/hot food as I work in the heat most days so this combo is very appealing."
"5","So far this had been the best CB I have been to. The wait is shorter than the one on bell and 101. I love the cheesy hashbrown casserole and it is highly recommended. It is always pretty loud in CB, but is still enjoyable. I love to go Sundays after or before church."
"3","I found this restaurant to be very clean, and the service was great!  We had a very helpful waitress who helped us first-timers to find things that we would be happy with.  \n\nThe service was great - all around.  Quickly seated, quickly had drink order taken.  Had appetizers, the Chicken Lettuce Wraps, and they were better than PF Changs, and the serving size was generous!\n\nNice that they had a full bar of course.  : )\n\nThe best part was the quality of the dishes though.  Very tasty meals, and I enjoyed the orange chicken.\n\nThe only thing keep this from a five star review for me was the fact that it had a fishy smell in the place to remind me that they serve Sushi.  I am not saying it was bad, but just a little too much for me.  \n\nNonetheless, the service and the food quality both mean I will certainly be back again!  Enjoy!"
"1","Q"
"1","Rudest people I have ever encountered.  Husband and wife owned business and when I called for service the wife was unbelievably and unnecessarily rude and demanding.  Don't waste your time calling."
"5","Great service, fast, and friendly hops. Love the happy hour prices before 11am, and 2-4pm. Also their coupons are always a good way to save. I just reloaded a sonic card for $25 and got a free burger coupon!"
"1","DONT GO HERE! The service was TERRIBLE and they were super unfriendly.... I tried telling them they needed to fix my pinky nail cause it looked so jacked up and they insisted it looked great.... Worst experience ever! On top of that my nails were full of bubbles and didn't even last a week before they started to peel up!!"
"1","This was my first time getting my nails done. I was already nervous when I walked into the salon, I didn't know what I was doing. I asked for a full set with nail polish. \nApparently, this meant a full set with just the tips painted. When I asked for the whole nail painted, the man said no. I was upset but I didn't complain. I had called just before I came in to let them know what I wanted and to ask of they accepted Discover. When I produced my Discover debit card to pay, they said they didn't accept it. What? I had JUST asked not 30 minutes ago. So, I paid with different card and gave a $5 tip in cash. By the end of it, my nails look uneven and are not what I even wanted. I am never going back. The place seemed old and dirty and full of gaudy decorations. I will be never ever go back to this business. It's inexpensive but, the customer service is nonexistent and the hygiene is lousy."
"1","We placed an order at 735 and asked if they delivered to our address. They said yes, for $3. They also said it would be 40 minutes. An hour later...we called to find out where our food was! The guy who answered said \""oh I was just getting ready to call you...I can't deliver to you. Its too far.\"" Um, OK! Way to run a bad business buddy and keep your word! The ratings here aren't even that good but we thought we'd try it since they supposedly delivered to deer valley road. BTW, if you are in our area, Pronto Pizza does deliver, FOR FREE, and their ratings are better than this dump. Thanks for nothing, pink lotus!!!"
"3","Gotta have some love for the dive bars!  This really fits the mould.  Great burgers and all the beer you want as long as its a domestic :)"
"4","Great place for breakfast and to watch the airplanes land and take off - service has been mixed depending on day of week.  Obviously Sat & Sun am are very busy."
"1","If I could give less than one star, I would. I am an MD myself, and I have never seen such poor care from start to finish. I went to the appointment with my father and although we arrived on time, we waited for 2 hours The doctor, Dr. Sink,  was not familiar with my father, his care, or the consultants care. When I asked her about his lung nodule and what they were going to do next, She asked him \""what did the pulmonary doctor tell you\"", since she did not know or remember that he even had a lung nodule. She did not know his medications or the dose and had to leave the room to look it up on the pharmacy web site. She also missed the tear in his knee. \nWe filled out a request that for his medical records and paid. We were told it would be 6-8 weeks. We never received them. Called today and they say no record of of the request.  I am not surprised since they are the most disorganized doctors office I have ever seen. Charts are everywhere, the office is filthy and they are grossly understaffed. And the doctor is TERRIBLE."
"1","I've gone here twice simply to put gas. The lady behind the counter needs training, a hearing aid, and a customer 101 class.\n\nI just needed gas. The first time I go there, the card doesnt work at the pump. I guess you always have to prepay your gas here??? So I go in and she rudely tells me \""how\"" to use the credit card machine at the pump. MM hm. ok lady. Then I give her my card WITH my ID and it takes her two minutes to find my NAME on my ID. Really????\n\nSo, I give her a dollar amount to run and finally, we're on our way.\n\nWe drove all over the place so the next morning I needed another fill up.\n\nAgain, the card thing doesnt work. I go back in to prepay my gas. I go back out to pump and NOTHING. It's not working. I'm like what the crap?!\n\nAfter freezing my butt off in the cold trying to get it to work I finally go back in and tell her its not working.\n\nShe goes, didn't you say pump 3? I said NO, I SAID $30 ON 1. I'm the ONLY car out there!! She presses the issue and says again, I couldve sworn you said three. I yell back, NO. I SAID ONE! I grab my receipts (after she tells me to keep all my receipts, which flags me that she's probably done this MANY times) and run out the door fuming. What an idiot!"
"2","Not exactly what I would call a great place to eat. If you want to take your teenager out for a shake or ice cream you may enjoy it :)"
"4","very frequent guest of this location and have never left upset of the food or service.  all the staff is friendly from the busboys on up to management.  their food is good and reasonable and large servings.  I have eaten here for all meals the only thing I would not reorder is the Cadillac meatloaf, everything else has been superb!"
"1","I have 3 friends graduating March 2015. i only hear them say \""my instructor said...\""  They lack knowledge of newer technology--i have to prove there lack of knowledge by actually showing them a bike.   They are taking instructors opinion as gospel. I'm hoping that MMI is getting factory training/information and teaching accurate information. Instructors could stop educating students on how motorcycle manufacturers produce crappy products. If only the manufactures knew what MMI is saying about their bikes. You'd think that MMI would have made the best motorcycle in the world with their big headed instructors and new graduates.  MMI should teach professionalism and customer service skills since customers will be putting food on their table.  Thanks but no thanks, i won't let these guys touch my customers bike--too much at stake. I'll let them dispose of waste materials and sweep the floor.  I agree with Ken S, $20K down the drain. Maybe cheaper by attending lawn mower repair course, then be mentored for motorcycle repair."
"5","I have been going here for many years, and every time I go it's a great personable experience. When you go to most salons there is always one person (nail tech) you prefer, but at this salon they're all amazing."
"2","I am in a monthly rental and the AC goes out. I reluctantly called the Home Warranty co. To schedule an appt. They showed up fairly quickly, but the tech was not very friendly, spent a LONG time looking at the unit and then told me he \""temporarily\"" fixed it until it really breaks. OK? A few hours later the house is hotter, call back for another appt. The next guy out looks at the unit and tells me he can't fix it tonight that it needs to thaw out first. (Its summer in phoenix, not gonna happen) Total BS...my husband had to tell him how to fix it and once he finally listened, he was able to make the repair. Crappy service, rude employees."
"1","HORRIFIC. Do you people have taste buds? Four stars, you lunatics?! 1: crack head paradise outside of the \""restaurant\"". 2. filthy inside with the yummalicous smell of old grease and grime. (why I proceeded to order I have no frickin clue). 3. pretty stupid expensive. $10 for a small plate for one 4. the food. YUCK. Got home, tried one bite of everything and threw it all away immediately to avoid eminent poisoning. Sesame chicken: unable to be chewed, tougher than deep fried leather with about the same taste. Beef with broccoli. The beef was creamy white. End of story on that one. Crab puffs: the middle was decent but the outside was so overcooked it was hard to get to. Egg roll: my sister bit down and spit it directly on the table. She's dramatic but not that dramatic. Lo mein: tasted exactly like old stinky cabbage. \n\nThe sign near the register read \""no refunds\"" so I didn't bother calling. The sweaty guy working the register and the grill probably wouldn't have cared anyway."
"1","Not the best by far. I am going to stick to my location over at Camelback ."
"4","So the first thing that might run through your mind when you stumble across this place might be, \""how good can an italian restaurant be that shares a parking lot with a BAP Imports Auto Parts?\"" But don't let this strange little strip mall make you drive on by.\n\nI first discovered Anzios when I was working in a corporate center near metro and was desperate for different lunch choices. My delight in discovering this little place was offset by the quick 5lbs that I put on after realizing my dream of eating lunch there 3 times a week.\n\nThe prices are great, the staff is friendly, the food is fabulous, the portions are decent, and the atmosphere is relaxed. This isn't one of those pretentious places that you go to be seen, but if you want really good food, you have found the right place.\n\nLet me start by saying they have THE BEST garlic bread that I have had outside of little Italy in NYC. I'm not a huge fan of their Chicken Parm, but everything else is spot on. My favorite is their meal is their spaghetti dinner with tomato sauce and sauteed mushrooms. All dinners come with either homemade soup or a great salad and the bread that I mentioned above.\n\nIf you want to watch the game sit in the room with the bar and you will be able to root on your team while munching down on some of the best pizza and wings in town.\n\nAnd if you want pure comfort food, order the Don Steak sandwhich. It's been a while since I've been to Philly, but this is an incredible version of the cities famous sandwhich (make sure to ask for sides of alfredo and red sauce) that is sure to please.\n\nThe desert menu is limited, but if you have any room after stuffing yourself with an entree, might I suggest one of there hot fudge sudaes. It is served on a hot brownie, topped with all the great googly moogly stuff and is big enough to share with three friends!\n\nI love these little non-chain joints and anytime two people can have dinner, wine, and desert for around $40, it's a keeper."
"1","Burnt garlic toast. Oh there's supposed to be garlic on that? Decent wings but half of the 1 pound plate was comprised of batter \""nuggets\"". And the pie. Uncooked soggy dough crust. Extra napkins provided to soak up the grease on this half baked abomination. Service was abysmal too. Do you think that when 3 of 5 have left the place we might want the check and aren't going to stick around for dessert? Sorry I just cannot recommend this place to anyone."
"2","Food was good. Waitress \""Maggie\"" has no common sense. Spoke with owner and got things cleared up. Still won't go back again."
"5","Arron Kyle and the team at this Guitar Center location went above and beyond to help a local band out who barely made it to the store before the store was closed.  Thanks for the capo and saving the day Arron!"
"1","Are you kidding me?!?!?!?\n$610 after takes for 4 tires priced at $105/each! $180 in installation and taxes???? And to top it off the whole buy 3 get the 4th free is a lie, its free after a 6-8 week rebate!!!! and not in cash but by VISA card only!\n\nGo to Fletchers, 4 tires (BFG's) for $450 OTD, with 4 free oil changes....could it have been any better?"
"1","I dont even know why anyone likes this place. All their meats taste exactly the same, like nasty rubber salami.\n\nAnd there was a fly in my soup.\n\nEven their commercials fucking suck. Did they really think Spongemonkeys singing the most annoying song in the world would make people want to buy sandwiches...?\n\nI'm all set with Quiznos. Thanks, but no thanks."
"5","A leg of the Quiznos franchises decided to go their own way and become \""Dad's Deli\"". This store is not one of them, it's still a Quiznos. I admit I'm a Quiznos fanboy, but this one is one of the better stores and it's hidden back in the corner of this shopping center.\n\nThe food here is good and the staff is friendly and fast."
"1","Drive thru chick named Kylie wouldn't take my order because I wanted two separate orders at 1 am. Both very small and simple, with one car in the drive thru other than myself. What a joke."
"3","Have passed by this place for years but was finally taken by a friend who claimed this as her favourite. Dingy with a CASH ONLY! sign seems kind of dodgy but it's kept up to standards and passes all the food inspections, so don't let the oldness of it scare you away. I ordered a quesadilla, 1/2 pint of rice, and three rolled tacos and all were fresh, hot, and delicious. The quesadilla was also bigger than your average tortilla so that's a bonus. Everything totaled to around $6 which is a bit more than your average Taco Bell but a lot better tasting - you get what you pay for!"
"2","I started dining here with my mom in early 2012. The last 3 visits we had over the summer were horrible. My mom's food was ice cold while mine arrived at the right temperature. When she asked the waitress for a new plate, she was given an attitude, like she was lying about how hot her food was. It took awhile for her to get her plate back and since I have good manners and went there to eat WITH my mom, I waited to eat my food until she had hers. The next two times service was very very slow, and there weren't that many people in the restaurant. It took over twenty minutes just to order drinks! While the food is okay, typical diner food, I will not be returning to this establishment due to it's serious lack of customer service."
"2","Never ever going back. The place stinks like cigarettes and the service is terrible. The food is mediocre, ihop may be better. Definitely wouldn't suggest to a friend."
"5","Chris knows his stuff, is friendly, comes to you, and offers great prices. Oh and he obviously has a great first name.\n\nThe Bike Doctor came within 24 hours of our call. He got my ~30 year old Huffy and my wife's ~25 year old bike up and running. The had been sitting in a hot, Phoenix garage through 10 summers with no use, and no maintenance. They were purchased at a garage sale before that in Michigan before coming here.\n\nAnd now they run great. Chris replaced our seats with something far more comfortable and told us about the bikes. And all told the price was lower than bike shops that we would've had to travel to.\n\nHe accepts Paypal, cash and check. If you need to use plastic, have a paypal account ready. If you need a tuneup, seriously. Call this guy!"
"2","I will start this review with saying that The Garcia on 35th Avenue is the only one you should go to.... this location was a huge disappointment...the only reason I give it a 2 star is because the service was good...our server was really nice, we had the tortilla soup, salad, and a grande burrito, I think... Let me start with the burrito...aside of onions and the dried chicken and beef inside, there was nothing to this... I think I make 100% better mexican food than this people, and I'm from Panama--LOL... now the soup, yak... horrible and the salad, had a big peace of lettuce that looked like fungus was growing on it... my little one gagged... I almost complained, but what's the point, we are never going there again... better off going to and Humberto, Roberto, Filiberto...whatever you called those places... believe me you will never be this disappointed."
"1","Used a coupon from living social went to Garcias first the margarita was horrible then came the appetizer fried mini chimis they were ok at best finally here comes dinner the plate was so hot couldn't touch it food was cold inside and out and tasted horrible last dessert looked ok ice cream was froze solid had to wait 20min to eat it. All and all i will never return to this restaurant will be surprised if its still open in 6 months ."
"3","I managed to resist China Harvest Buffet over there, so the diet should be fine...     :-)\n\nUh oh!  What's that yellow sign up there on the left?     :-O\n\nSo I whipped into this nice Church's for the usual, a 2-Piece Meal which gives you a big chicken leg & thigh (Spicy Style in my case), mashed potatoes & gravy, and a drop biscuit with spread.\n\nThings were less than perfect for me at this particular Church's today:\n\n*  The service was weak.  I wasn't thanked for my business, and had to ask several times for some spread for the biscuit, which girl was going to \""go get\"" while my biscuit got cold.  Also had to ask for salt & pepper, which they had hidden under the counter, unlike at other Church's.\n\n*  The seat of my chair was fall-off loose, & someone could break their neck just sitting on it!\n\n= = = = = =\n\nIt wasn't all bad:\n\n*  The bathroom was clean & properly set up & stocked.\n\n*  My lunch was served up piping hot & delicious!  (That's one thing, isn't it?)\n\n*  The value was terrific at $1.99 for everything, & girl even gave me an ad with an identical replacement coupon, just in case I ever mess up again on the diet.     :-)"
"4","This place is H U G E!!!  Aisles and aisles of possible treasure.  Every turn you make is a surprise.  Overall I found the prices on the stuff I was looking for to be very reasonable.  The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable too.  Since their inventory changes constantly, if you don't find your diamond in the rough today, come back tomorrow!  I for for one can't wait to get back!"
"1","Often, amenable accommodations can be soured by an incompetent staff that ruins one's stay, or potential stay. Some might say that one should not give so much weight to service, and instead ignore it and enjoy the space created by architect humans at some recent point of our species' history for the sole purpose of potential enjoyment by other humans. \n\nI think that the staff at Crowne Plaza Hotel - Phoenix should be maligned. Not merely maligned; but, summarily fired. All of those humans: fired. \n\nStaff is rude. And incompetent. And -- worst of all -- disrespectful. \n\nFire them! Fire them all."
"5","I bought a pump housing off eBay that happened to come from Perry's.  I chose to have it shipped despite being in town because the $7.00 shipping charge was very reasonable and cheaper than the gas it would take driving.\n\nAs it turned out, we had order the wrong part.  My husband called the store and they said they would exchange it no problem.  I drove there the next Saturday and the exchange was quick and easy.  He even charged me the internet price on the correct part so the difference was just a couple of dollars.  \n\nThe store was pretty busy and judging by the stock of pumps and parts in the back it looks like they do a pretty good volume.  We are due probably for a whole new pump soon and I will definitely look to Perry's before anyone else."
"5","These guys are great! I bought a brand new hot tub from Atera. The number one pump would not work.\nThe troubleshoot guide online said it was the wiring switch (also called the centrifugal switch.) Atera said it was my fault and the warranty was void because the GFCI was in main breaker and not the sub panel. (ridiculous) they charged me $300 and did not fix the problem. I took the pump to Perry's and they fixed it with a new switch. NO CHARGE!\nI am taking my 12 year old pool pump to them today for an overhaul. Leslies and Shasta wanted $1200 for a new pump. I am certain Perry's will  beat that."
"3","The food is gonna be what the food is gonna be, you know that.\nSo I judge a FFchain on a few things.\nIs it clean.\nAre they friendly.\nDo they fahqew in the drive thru?\n\nThis Taco Hell scores consistently mediocre on all counts, except that they are quite friendly.\n\nIt is refreshing to pull into the drive thru, and even if there were a line of cars ahead of you, to hear the mechanical voice in the box say, \n\""Hi, How are you?\""\n...and then pause for an answer!\n\nThey do it all the time, so must be made to say it, but it always seems sincere.  It catches you off guard at first, but now I have grown to really dig the tone it conveys.  I don't think that the couple of seconds it may delay the order is a big deal at all, compared to the warm fuzzy feelings I get when I respond, \n\""I'm fine. How are you?\""...and get a genuine response back.\n\nI'm not here that often, but more since they demolished the Del Taco across the street to build a CVS freestanding location (good call, since the strip mall CVS in that shopping ctr is gross).\n\nI have noticed that there are several employees that seem to have stuck around and worked here for well over a year, maybe two -- good sign when you're judging a FFchain, since turnover = non-caring employees.\n\nSo in summary:\nIt's clean enough.\nThey're quite friendly.\nThey haven't yet fahq'd me in the drive thru.\n\nEdited:\n\nMeh for food.\nYay! I'm a fan for friendliness.\n\nAccording to my personal rating system that's much too complicated to show here, this equates to an A-OK overall."
"4","Love their shakes! :)"
"2","You most likely will not agree with us on this one but that's OK and I say that because of the Yelp Rating and the crowd I saw while dining here my Yelp is being based on two lunches .\n\nAs soon as we were seated we received a bowl of chip crumbs that were dripping with oil and a small dish of what I think was sweet and sour sauce the color was  red .\n\nNext came our cup of soup and we both picked Egg Drop the soup was actually very good and fresh and  that made me think our meals would be great !\n\nSoon our meals came and they were VERY LARGE and also came with egg rolls and fried wantons both were fried to a cigar color I didn't eat them and steamed white rice (the rice was good) But my meal called Amazing Chicken had this sauce on it that tasted like sweet and sour sauce mixed with wing sauce and I tried to eat it but after a few pieces I lost my appetite and it is a shame because the vegetables were fresh and nice , the chicken was tender juicy not spongy it was cooked nice but that sauce killed the dish for me .\n\nMy husband didn't care for the sauce that came on his lotus dish but I think he didn't care for the fried rice even more because he thought it was rice with basically just soy sauce . \n\nNobody checked on us .\n\nWhen the busboy noticed our pushed away plates he didn't even ask if I wanted to take it with me...guess he knew I didn't"
"5","My wife and I had a carryout order of orange beef and general's chicken with white rice. All were good and fresh. The chicken was thick and juicy, not thin and tough slathered with sauce to cover the poor quality of the meat. The sauces were very good. Polite service over the phone and in person."
"4","Bullshooters is a great place to go to have a little fun.  During the day, there are hard core billiards players that flock there with their specialized equipment, but at night, most people are there to have fun.  There are tons of pool tables, electronic dart boards, and ping pong tables.  the beer selection leaves a lot to be desired, but the crowd is more Bud Light than craft most of the time."
"4","Kung Paola's good... Trying General Tsao today"
"5","After deciding I liked a particular stool in the copenhagen store, I was trying to make my way back to make a final decision. I ended up finding out about this place while searching yelp for the copenhagen store operation hours and noticed a clearance center. I'm so glad I did!\n\nI wouldn't exactly say that you can get a matching set of just about anything, they have an eclectic selection of mix and match clearance items. I was specifically looking for bar stools at the time, and was able to find some that originally cost upwards of $300+ retail cost, and ended up grabbing them up for just over $100 a piece. The stools I found here were better than the one I was going back to the store to check out!\n\nIt was great, I was able to stay in my $300 budget and come home with great looking and quality chairs as opposed to \""meehhh, whatever\"" I could get from the local swap meet or craigslist.\n\nIm so happy I found you Copenhagen Imports Clearance Center, I will definitely be back if I ever need more furniture!"
"1","Worst staff ever. The ladies at the front desk are horrible. i liked the doctor I had but the staff is the worst"
"2","To be completely honest I hate this Home Depot . It is in a horrible part of town and the \""workers\"" ill call them are EVERYWHERE. I pull into Home Depot around 530 am and about 15 ft into the lot I have \""workers\"" practically throwing themselves at my van trying to wave me down . \n\nAlso other pet pieves is that since there are so many out here (20-30) no joke every day, They have people strolling around on bikes selling you tamales, ice cream, and those chips and salsa. And my biggest laugh was during lunch one day i was working at the Carls Jr and there were about 10 of them playing soccer in thw parking lot!!! WOW \n\nNow I have no problem with them trying to get work and make a living but when you bring 50+ people to a business Lot and it turns the lot into your own private soccer field and stadium with vendors that just drives me nuts."
"1","Westrige mall was better than this mall even when most of the stores were about to shut down. When I visited this mall recently most the stores looked cluttered and unkept."
"4","Lam's Seafood Market is a rare Asian gem in the Westside.. sort of like me ;-) haha just kidding. \n\nI love this place! Great prices, fresh seafood :-)\nThey also have a wide assortment of Filipino products which is a MUST for my kitchen. \n\nThe parking lot is a lil shady and could use some covering for the potholes."
"1","Bad service altogether"
"1","Zero stars,  if I  could give it. This place SUCKS. The waitress shows up to take your order, drop off your food and give you a check. Doesn't stop by to see if you need anything. Place is filthy. Food is terrible. Service horrible.  Will never  return to a Long Wongs restaurant."
"1","Absolute worst dining experience of my life. When we walked in there was only one clean table, not empty mind you, just clean. The wait for our food was astronomical. When food finally came out it was cold and the sandwiches were wrong! Who puts mayo on pastrami anyhow?? Wait staff was to busy talking on their phones to pay attention to customers. As I sit here writing this I am STILL waiting on the check and we have been done eating for a good 20 minutes. Save yourself the hassle! Don't go!"
"2","Nondescriptly scuzzy. I don't know if it's just worn down, overused, or just kinda dirty. \nIt always feels crowded. The most annoying thing ever is that the dumbbells are NEVER put away. Some of that is the customer base, sure,but when you see a guy packing 200+ lbs of dumbbells around a bench to do some bro-science exercise (yes, this happened regularly) say something to him about it! Make him put his weights away! \nI haven't been in awhile because of these reasons. The sauna didn't work for the two and a half weeks I tried to use this gym. Bummer."
"5","Been coming here since 1986. Hands down, the best Mexican food in town. I'm in the Air Force and have lived all over the country. I have yet to find Mexican food anywhere else that can compare to Popo's.  Every time I come back to Phoenix for a visit, Popo's is the first stop I make. Excellent rice! Don't forget to ask for the red sauce with your chips!"
"4","Popo's is one of the old fashioned kind of Mexican restaurant that I rarely go to anymore. Mostly cuz they are often so generic and blah. \nYet there is something  warm and homey and satisfying about this spot, like  some body's grandmother looked around the grocery store and decided to add things like add cream cheese to her traditional cooking. And it works for me. \nThe other day, after a long hot hike in the desert,  we ended up here to completely stuporize ourselves. I was pleased to see the happy servers and multigenerational groups getting some shade and 99 cent margaritas on a Sunday afternoon.\nI looked around at what the other diners were having and decided on the chimichanga, enchilada style. I really liked the enchilada sauce and the red chili filling which was actually spicy with melt in your mouth cubes of beef. Seriously like my mom used to make. I skipped the rice and beans because this deep fried baby was more than filling on its own. Especially as we had started with a small bowl of the chile con Queso dip that was soothing and smooth with just a little kick. The chips accompanying the dip were warm and crisp. \nThis is the place when you want Mexican comfort food that actually also has some flavor. As other reviewers have noted, it's heavy and hearty fare.  But sometimes that's what you need."
"5","There aren't enough good things I can say about Popo's.  My husband and I are locals who have the choice of dozens upon dozens of Mexican restaurants, and we always choose Popo's.  We don't even consider going anywhere else.  The food is awesome, the prices are very reasonable, and the service is great.  It's where we take our out-of-town guests, where we celebrate any occasion, and its always the choice for \""let's do lunch\"".  They have recently opened a location at 59th Ave & Bell and the food is exactly the same.  Hubby likes the enchiladas and, me, I'm a machaca girl myself.  Go there!  You won't be sorry!"
"3","Please hire more help in the evenings and keep black walnut in stock! That's all. Thank you."
"1","I love KFC, but this location is horrible. I stopped by on 7/21/14 and bought 2 meals. The chicken was dry and way overcooked. They really need to get some workers in there that know how to cook. I have been going to this location for several years now, and the first few times the chicken was awesome (about 3 years ago), but it has gone downhill since then. The other location that went downhill closed last year (105th / Indian School). I really hope the corporation looks at these reviews and attempts to solve the problems, because KFC is our favorite place for chicken. I gave 1 star for the side dishes."
"4","The pizza here was good. The only complaint I have is that the pizza was a little doughy so we ended up putting it in our oven at home to cook a little longer and it came out delicious. The crust was crispy and the toppings were good. We would come again and hopefully get a pizza that's cooked thoroughly."
"5","I contacted this office after not hearing back from a different chiropractic office that I had visited prior when I called to check on insurance. I was able to get everything verified within 15 minutes over the phone and scheduled for next day care. Upon arriving I met Dr. Haggard and was impressed with how personable he was. We talked for a bit, took x-rays, and then got right to work on treatment.\nI received a follow up call the next day asking how I was feeling by Dr. Haggard himself and followed up today for my next treatment. We reviewed the final x-rays and then came up with a plan for correction. \nAll in all I've been more than pleased with the treatment, follow through, and personalities at Haggard Chiropractic. They've done an excellent job of making themselves stick out from their competition in the chiro industry."
"1","The one thing that cannot be disputed about Lim's -- a well-established restaurant in the West Valley -- is that the service is very friendly.  \n\nOkay:  that was the generous part of this review.  Buckle your seatbelt:  this isn't going to be a smooth ride.\n\nOnce again, my theorem about YELP has been confirmed:  the more stars a restaurant has, the more you should avoid it.  I'm convinced that every prisoner released from Sheriff Joe's tent city is promised a $20 bill for their first night's meal in freedom, PROVIDED they write a review on YELP.  How else can one explain the 4 and 5 stars for this place?  Certainly, it couldn't be for the fluorescent lit diner atmosphere ... and it certainly couldn't be for the food ... could it?!?\n\nThe Hot n Sour soup was okay.  My partner thought it too sour.  Hello!  The \""sour\"" isn't in the name to make it sound pretty.  I didn't think it too sour at all and they certainly don't skimp on ingredients:  the soup is loaded.  From there, however, it started going downhill faster than a snowball down the side of a steep ski run.\n\nThe egg rolls, too, weren't bad ... a bit greasy, but filled almost exclusively with cabbage, which I like.  But the two dishes specifically mentioned in reviews here -- the Devil Beef and the Mu Shu Pork -- were as disappointing as a visit to the U.S. Senate.  Unfortunately, the quality of the food matched the Senate's performance, too.  Even before I could open my mouth, my other half said what I was thinking when they brought the beef out:  \""My God!  It looks like someone's already eaten it!\""  Mushy, grey, and in spite of the jalapenos in it, bland.  Sort of like Senator John McCain, except it wasn't demanding we go to war in Syria.  And while it is advertised in the menu, Chinese food with ... jalapenos?!?  Chinese-Mexican fusion?!?!  \n\nThe Mu Shu Pork was something I'd never seen before in the many years I've eaten Chinese:  pre-rolled Mu Shu.  Usually, they bring you the wrapping and the filling is on the side and you make it yourself.  Not here:  they do it for you.  That by itself might have been acceptable to all but the Mu Shu Pork fanatic.  But what wasn't acceptable was the salt level in the food.  Unless you have a high tolerance for salty food, prepare to have lots of water nearby and watch your blood pressure go into the 150s over 110!\n\nService was fast, but almost like something out of a bad comedy about Chinese restaurants:  everything was brought at once, regardless of how close you were to finishing the previous course.  The only thing they DIDN'T do was observe you from a distance and wait for you to finish eating.\n\nIt pains me to give a bad review to a restaurant, which is obviously trying to please its customers.  In this case, however,  I'm afraid the review is fully justified.  I don't know who the people are on here, who think this is quality food.  I can only say to that one person, for example, who said he/she wishes this place was closer so he/she didn't have to drive all the way here:  KEEP DRIVING!  \n\nI rarely leave food on my plate and, when I do, I always ask for a doggie bag to take the leftovers home.  In this case, I left food on the plate and almost shouted \""no\"" too enthusiastically when I was asked if I needed a box to take the remainder home.  Oh God in Heaven:  NO!!!!!"
"2","Love Nurse Purtee. Hate that im always waiting over an hour past my appointment time even when im 20 minutes early. Also hate that I have to schedule immunizations over 6 weeks in advance."
"2","made an apointment for a wellcheck for my daughter, was never told anything was wrong with her, no special treatment seemed to be given but when i got the bill from my insurance company they had billed my insurance company for a sick visit instead. \n\nhas this happened to anyone else ? \n\nno problem with the actual care at the facility."
"5","I've been coming here since 1988 and I've always been very happy with the food. This is primarily a lunch Establishment with the best food, prices, and quality service in the Valley. This is the only place that I know of where you still can get a lunch that fills you up for a mere $5. The dinner menu is more or less identical to the lunch menu with bigger portions and an average of $1.50 more for each dish. The quality of food between the two different locations (Baseline and Central) are of the same caliber. You simply can't beat the combination of great tasting food, filling portions, and affordable price! This food is on par with both Pei Wei and P.F. Chang's except for the fact that it is far cheaper!"
"2","hate the service. please fix"
"2","Since I was coming over to Glendale, AZ for Baseball Spring Training, I had to book a hotel for three days. I didn't really care where I was going to stay. So, I used Priceline's Bid System and with the low price I submitted, I was going to stay at the Crossland Economy Studios. \n\nI wasn't going to use the hotel that much since I was going to see the Los Angeles Dodgers at Camelback Ranch. So, this place was perfect to just sleep and go. Prices will vary when you stay here. I forgot to take a photo of this place, but its on McDowell and 51st Ave. It is a three floor hotel or an apartment. Why I said that?! Well, it seems like it was made as an apartment versus a hotel. The elevator button was missing for a bit on the third floor. \n\nThe room is simple with a small electric stove, sink, and microwave. I didn't have tub, just a shower with a seat. For some reason, my room had some strawberry jelly all over the place. Not sure what that was about. Someone didn't clean the place thoroughly. Also, I noticed that every time I left the room and come back many hours later, I noticed the bathroom was a little wet, but major. So, there are some plumbing issues here. TV is very standard and room has an AC...COVERED WITH STRAWBERRY-COLOR'd type jelly. I swear it was all over the room.\n\nThere plenty of fast food places you can eat at that are just walking distance from the hotel: Sonics, McDonalds, and etc. If you are collecting trash, please note that housekeeping does charge. There are trash bins near the stairwells to dump the trash. \n\nOffice Hours are from 630am to 10pm. I had to leave a bit early, but there is a phone just outside the office to call the front desk. There isn't much to complain since I had already known that it was going to happen. If you don't plan to use your room often and save $$$$, then this is a place to stay. \n\nYelp is my Review, My Story, and My Life. It's time to share it."
"4","This place is probably the lowest priced you can find in Phoenix. And you get what you pay for so my expectations were low to begin with. We can't afford the prices of nicer motel/hotels and must stay in these lower priced places. You can imagine my surprise to find this motel much better than we anticipated. The rooms aren't the best - they're just average low priced rooms. The beds were comfy enough, TV worked fine and had some decent stations, kitchenette was fully furnished and two burners.  I didn't see any roaches and I checked the mattress for bed bugs (do this everywhere!)  You can't beat the price. We only stayed one night. Yes, there were some nefarious looking individuals we walked by but all turned out fine. They looked scarier than they were. For the price, I would stay here again except for my biggest issue. Very weak wifi signal. So getting online was difficult most of the time. For me it's a deal-breaker. I completed one of those online review forms provided by Crossland and mentioned my disappointment in the wifi. I was surprised to receive an email from the general manager indicating he would be looking into improving it. I hope that happens. I will stay there again if it gets fixed."
"1","Took my grand kids for first time at this location. Where I come from they skate, not here. Order took a long time, beef way undercooked, fries blah, chick strips not good. No one liked anything...server looked stoned."
"4","Not the first Texas Roadhouse I have been to (been to the Las Ceruces, NM and the west-side El Paso, TX location).  They all have good quality food that makes for a good dinner.  What made this one stand out?\n\nThe music was at a volume where we could actually have a conversation at the table.  I wish they would do this at all locations!  Usually, you can't hear yourself think in a Texas Roadhouse, at least from my other experiences."
"3","my experience here was just OK.  Our server was VERY pushy it his attempts to upsell, almost to the point that I was getting frustrated.  You shouldn't have to come up with creative ways to say \""no thank you\"" but anyway... Other than that, the food was decent, and for as busy as the place way, it was relatively decent service.  Could have been better, but definitely cool have been worse."
"4","Took my mom here for her birthday last week and we had a fantastic time. ( the added fun of seeing her sitting on a saddle and being YEE-HAWED! By a room of patrons didn't hurt!)    But the food was very nice. Mom had the prime rib and swears it's the best she's ever eaten. I had the Tbone and was very pleased. The thing that puts the roadhouse at the top of my list however, was the perfect spicy bloody Mary from the bar. Soooo good.     Give them a try.... Try not to slip on the peanut shells."
"2","This has got to be one of the worst Wal-Mart's I have ever been to. My friend just moved to this neighborhood so we decided to go to this Wal-Mart so he could get some items for his new home. It was late, around 11:40PM. We needed to get some things from electronics but when we got to that department we realized they had it blocked off. We asked what was going on and they told us that their location now shuts down electronics at 11PM. ARE YOU SERIOUS?! THIS IS WAL-MART! The point of having a 24 hour location is for convenience. They even had the makeup department shut down too. \n\nWhich brings me to why I'm giving this location 2 stars instead of 1. I went up to an employee (SWEETEST MAN EVER!) and ask if he would let me go into the makeup department and get the face lotion that I had primary came to Wal-Mart for. This employee knew he shouldn't and even stated he wasn't suppose to, YET he still allowed me to go in there and get the lotion I came for. The fact that he risked getting in trouble to help me find what I needed blew my mind. That man deserves to work for a better company, a company that appreciates their employees that actually care about their customers. That's what I consider going the extra mile. HE DESERVES A RAISE! I wish I knew his name, all I know is that he was restocking the lotion when I approached him and he told me he just got back from vacation so he wasn't entirely certain why they had shut down those departments at 11PM.\n\nDo yourself a favor and NEVER go to this Wal-Mart unless you want to talk to that AWESOME employee."
"1","Specifically speaking of the Pharmacy Dept. I was very displeased with my service. I went there after a very long and stressful doctor's appointment for my two sick kids. The line was so long I had to stop and question if i really wanted to wait that long but i had to get my kids' meds. I stood in line for 15 minutes before the first person was helped. The line was about 20 people deep and they had 1 person on the register at the end of her shift. There was another lady there who I have seen work the register but she appeared to be training a new hire. This lady only stepped up to help when another Wal-mart employee cut the line and asked for help picking up her Rx. when another customer started complaining about the situation she started ridiculing her instead of helping out. Then the pharmacist had to announce an apology to the crowd and explain that they were short staffed. Same employee never got on the register because she was training but did leave to go get staples and asked the one person on the register to help the trainee learn the register. She has been there for a long time but really I think it is time she moved on. Clearly she has no idea what customer service is all about. \n\nPS. This happened a few weeks ago. I wasn't going to write this because there are plenty of employees in this department that are outstanding but really I think they would be better off without this particular employee."
"4","Rand H sent me an email the other morning about meeting here for lunch.  It was close and I could make it so I joined him.  Over the years I have liked Olive Garden pretty much.  Right now they have a never ending salad and pasta special going on for $8.95.  I make red sauces at home so I tend to get white sauces when I go out.  This time my choice was Alfredo on spaghetti which came out just as expected.  Instead of getting a second bowl of pasta I chose to make the serving bowl of salad a single serving size and only had one bread stick.\n\nWe were greeted immediately upon entering and seated.  It didn't take long for our waitress to show and offer us a sample of wine which I had to turn down because I was going to spend the afternoon running machinery.  The service was good throughout the meal and the staff worked as a team when they needed to.  This was my first time at this location and I would certainly return."
"2","I took my order to go and was extremely dissatified with the quality. I ordered the chicken alfredo for my anniversary and when I got home to check it, the noodles were very dry and had a very minute amount of alfredo sauce. Also, the noodles were halfway over cooked. Next time I would definately check my food before leaving and ask for extra sauce. Brooklyn Boys' alfredo blows this place out of the water!"
"5","Wow a burger \nWhat service\n1st time I dined inside \nStaff and management were superb \nI was in awe \nI don't even know what I ate\nThey really cheered up my mood and day\nThanks WAB!"
"2","This was the only course with available tee times on a Saturday morning, so my buddies and I in from out of town tried it out. \n\nThe course was in terrible shape, it was really slow, the surrounding houses were full of yelling people and barking dogs, and there was even a kid riding his bike in the middle of the 9th fairway. \n\nI gave it a generous two stars because it was pretty cheap, and I guess you get what you pay for."
"5","Bit pricey but it's well worth it. The pizza is the best you can get outside of New York. Heesa the owner is very friendly and makes my group feel at home.  The mild wings taste better then the hot, that's the key...MILD are the best.  Again, the pizza is outta this world.  I do have a neg hit, Tiffany the waitress is condescending rag riding beer wench.  Order what you need but don't look her in the eye, you'll turn to stone, and she'll burn your face off with looks of death.\n\nThe rest of the staff are awesome, friendly, and they know exactly what you always order.  I LOVE brodders Pete-zer!!!!"
"5","I grew up in Arizona and we went to Wongs every Sunday after church.  Three years ago we got stationed in Hawaii.  Everytime I come home, our first stop is Wongs.  I love everything about it.  Wongs is my comfort food."
"5","Since our move to the south west valley, my family had been looking for a good chinese restaurant.  I found this restaurant from yelp and other sites and true to form...the reviews pretty much sum up wongs on indian school.  Located on the north side of indian school across from the chase bank..in a dainty strip mall...it sits next door to an unknown bookstore with the most inconsistant store close times...sometimes its open....other times...nope.  anyway.....as you walk into wongs, there is a front table with a  register and an older asian lady that looks very judgemental...the truth of the matter is..she probably is...but who cares, im there to eat!  My family and i go at least once every week or two.  We usually have the chinese eggplant with beef special and my kids devour the lemon chicken.  I once tried the spicy beef with mushrooms...delicious.  i also had experimented with the chicken corn soup....delicious.  you cant really go wong with wongs..give it a try!"
"4","Great alternative to buffet Chinese. Huge portions and cooked to order. Lunch specials come with more food than one should eat! Pleasant staff and decent atmosphere. I will eat there again."
"4","Great simple Chinese food. We've been going here off and on for years and I'm addicted to their garlic chicken. Staff is helpful, prices are reasonable, and the portions are generous. A good, safe bet for Chinese food."
"5","I've been coming to this Ramiro's since the late 90's. I have always had a great experience when it comes to the food, always so fresh tasing!! The staff is always friendly and smiling and their menudo on the weekends is definitely some of the best around. You can really taste the love and care that goes in to all of the food here."
"3","We are a big family so buying in bulk is essential.The thing we don't like is that we always have to dodge the sales people. We feel harassed by the people trying to sell us cable subscriptions, professional portraits, and beauty products. I think it is very inconsiderate and disrespectful for SAMs club to subject their customers to this kind of harassment. We often find ourselves taking the long way to avoid them but this is not always enough since a lot of the cashiers are very persisting in getting us to upgrade our membership and imitate the same pestering behavior."
"5","So I want to tell you my story of getting my best buddy here at this location. And then I can do a proper review. \n\nI was looking for a cat as a friend and also as someone to help me through my depression. Animals are found to be great sources of help through everything, and I wanted to give a cat a forever home. So I looked on the website for a few days until I came upon a handsome Lynx Point Siamese. The second I saw him, I had a good feeling about him. So I went straight here. \n\nAt first I didn't see him anywhere and had to ask if he had already been adopted. They had him in quarantine to make sure he wasn't sick or anything, but I still got to meet him! Whew! What a releif. So it took a few extra minutes to get him, but I waited in one of the rooms. They brought him in a small blue crate. When they opened up the crate I sat on the floor to be more inviting to him. He looked around for a little bit and then came right up to me and let me pet him. He started walking on me and was really comfortable already. He really loved my attention and how I was talking with him. I had found my buddy I had been looking for. So I adopted him right on the spot! \n\nOn the way home, he escaped from the temporary box they put him in and came and sat on my lap the rest of the drive home. Normally I wouldn't let an animal do that for their safety, but he seemed so happy and content, I just couldn't move him until I got home. \n\nThat was just a little over a year ago. Now he's fully grown and is still my bestest kitty. I look forward coming home to him every day and hanging out with him. He really means the world to me. \n\nSo now that I got that out of the way, the Humane Society was wonderful when I went! I now make monthly donations to them. It's not a lot but the least I could do to help for all they did for me. The staff is very friendly and helpful. Everything is very clean, and everyone really does seem to care about the animals and who they go to. I really hope to volunteer sometime in the near future for them to help out even more. I would love to help out with the other cats. If I could, I would take them all home with me! \n\nThank you AZ Humane Society!"
"4","No nonsense, affordable prices.  Had my Audi in for service with Dan (someone whom I have total confidence in and have known since he worked at Chapman), no complaints as usual."
"1","If I could rate them 0 I would. I am still sitting on the side of the road waiting for them to arrive I called 3 hours ago and they said 75 minutes and they still are not here. Last I checked 75 minutes was 1 hour and 15 minutes. After reading all the reviews it's clear this company does not care about their reputation. I have say in the Arizona heat for 3 hours because of their lack of professionalism.  Do not use this company at all seriously call someone else. I just called another company because it's been 3.5 hours and I haven't even gotten an update or courtesy call. The other company said 1.5 hours give or take 15 minutes let's see who shows up first. I will update with answer soon\n\nCentral showed up after 4hours, I did cancel the other tow cause I'm not rude, but I will never use central towing again because they were not remotely close to the time promised even 30 min late would have been forgivable but 2 hours 45 min late in 100 degree weather is unacceptable. Then offering no discount or anything stay away"
"2","Tried this place out and the food was ok, what concerned me was the cleanliness of the kitchen. The floor was really dirty, under the burners or stove seemed to have months of grease buildup etc. 50c extra to use debit or credit card btw."
"5","Nice place to stay, good price for. CDL and AAA 49.99  A NIGHT"
"1","This location is horrible. .. the longest waits ever!! I have came here several times an each time is the same. I just ordered 2 chicken strip meals an after waiting at window for 10 min they asked me to pull up an park in front because they just dropped my chick3n strips.  Wow really what were they doing for the 10 min I was at the window.. iv been parked for 7 minutes an still no food. My baby is crying , im hungry, an this is just dumb..... I didnt even see a manager..."
"4","This is the best drunk food drunk money can buy. Very self explanatory, if not just order a greasy burger and enjoy. Never has any issues with this place at all, always friendly and correct. :)"
"1","Save your money guys. This pace is well kept and clean but... food not so much, way over priced for the poor food quality/quantity. Your better off finding a taco truck near by or heck just goto Denny's, you won't be as disappointed there."
"5","I recently had a building constructed by Bunger Steel and I will have to say that their whole process was amazing from start to finish. Definitely A+! Jennifer, the Project Coordinator, is definitely wonderful to work with and made the whole process smooth. I would highly recommend Bunger Steel for any of your building needs!"
"1","Holy Atomic Pile of Sh!t Batman!!!!\nThis stuff sucks.... Like the previous reviewer I got sucked in by the commercials. Plus they were the only ones open at 9:50PM for delivery. Else we would have done Barro's Pizza, which by the way is awesome!\n\nYes the website makes the process look cool but it is 2010 and I know high school kids with flashplayer skills that can do the same thing.\n\nOn to the food review!\n\nWe ordered a thin crust cali bacon chicken ranch pizza with mild chicken wings, cheesy bread, and that chocolate crunch cake thingy. \n\nThe Pizza and Bread... Tasted like they put tons of salt on it. I was hoping that the additional green peppers, onioins, and mushroom would give it some flavor but I would not  have noticed they were there if I did not order it. The crust was all right but how do you screw up a thin-crust? Let's not hold them to that though...\n\nThe cheesy bread was cheesy, crappy, and salty all rolled into one. \n\nThe chicken wings were not as cooked as I would have liked which made it even more gross.  There was a lot of skin on them. GROSS GROSS GROSS!!!  I am not sure what kind of sauce they put on it but it looked like watered down ketchup and it just looked plain nasty. It did not look appetizing at all! On a normal day I can throw down a double order of wings with no problem but with this I only ate 2 pieces and said to myself \""what a waste of money.\"" \n\nThe chocolate crunchy thing tasted okay but it was very sweet. I might be diabetic now because of it. \n\nNext time it's late and no one is open for delivery then I will either starve or get my lazy as up and drive somewhere that is open. Considering In-n-Out and Denny's is right down the street from me I definitely wasted my money. \n\nIf you enjoy wasting money on pooh then by all mean go for it.\n\nI would give this place negative stars if I could."
"5","Friendly service. They were spot on with the special requests I asked with my order. They made sure to offer sauces and did no ice in my drink per my request. The food came out quick. What more could I ask from Taco Bell"
"2","The place was dirty with screaming children running around out of control. I cant imagine a more unrelaxing setting. The food, while there was alot of it, was mediocre at best and at 11 dollars a person, not worth it IMO. The best part was that the drink was included in the price. I don't think I'll be back anytime soon."
"1","Today was our first time to eat here and it's the worst I've ever experienced. We got there and the lady at the front was on her cell the whole time. The food was disgusting and gross. I feel so embarrassed for picking this restaurant because of the high ratings on here.  To summarize, over priced disgusting gross food, no service and dirty surroundings. Not ever coming back."
"4","If you want somewhere shiny, big,fancy  Sarajevo is not your place, but if you want good food then you are at the right place.\nTheir food reminds me Turkish food but it is a little different.\nFor breakfast and lunch try their Borek(with chese or groundbeef) and Sundays they do Lamb on skewer.\nTheir Borek IS JUST LIKE MY MOMS. How can I not like this place.\nThe reason for 4 stars is smoking. They should not smoke inside."
"3","I like to go here to grab some subs on the way to the river, since it's between our house and the 17. Just because I don't want to go to Subway or Blimpie's.\n\nMostly, it's a rather expansive Italian market. Need olive oil? They have 20+ different kinds. Pasta? There's a whole aisle. How about one of those wooden thingies for making gnocchi. Got that too.\n\nIn the back, a counter runs along the whole length of the back wall. That's where you'll find all sorts of cheeses, cold cuts, and sausauge, plus a few sweets. \n\nIt's also where you order sandwiches. And you'd better know exactly what your want, and fast. The man behind the counter is perpetually surly and curt. It gets worse if you stand there and try to make heads or tails of all the hand-written sandwich combinations taped to the wall. Luckily, the woman who runs the cash register is always very sweet. So that kind of makes up for it.\n\nI want to love their sandwiches. I just don't. They're OK. The meat is always really good, there just isn't enough of it. Maybe I'm just not ordering the right things. \n\nUntil then, I'll continue to support Romanelli's, but they'll only get a so-so rating for the deli. The product selection, however, is top notch."
"5","This is the best Italian store here in AZ!!!  It is just like the ones back home in Chicago.  Only difference is the one back in Chicago that I used to go to (I think it was Gino's in Norridge...) also made calzones, arancinis, etc in their bakery section.  ALL Italian food, fresh made pasta.  And the family there that run the place are awesome!  It's been a while since I've been there but Robert is so helpful.  And they recognize my mom!!!  (After spending a couple hunge.)  Their cannolis and Italian Cassata cake is amazing, as are the rest!!!\n\nIf they would make homemade arancinis and fresh calzones they would get 6 stars from me!!!  The sandwiches are pretty good, I'm used to more crusty bread like back home.  Easy to spend more than you intended, but worth every penny!!"
"5","I went today for lunch and WOW I can't say how great this place was.  Ok you do have to get past the fact it's not the best looking location or even in the best area but this place is a must experience.  I got the Mexican Burger which came with grilled onions, mayo, monterry jack cheese, and green chili's.  I tried a fry first and was amazed I usually don't like the bigger cut fries cause they are never crispy enough but no these fries were the best I've had in a long time.  They came with seasoned salt on them and were just amazing.  I had a milkshake with m&m's which was amazing as well.  I can't say enough about how good this place is.  If you have never went as I never had you need to go NOW."
"5","WOW! Found this place thanks to reviews from YelpFriends, and boy, they were right - the burgers are fantastic! Really, really awesome big burgers at low prices; super seasoned fries and even fish 'n chips for your anti-social burger-free cousin. Big portions and great prices; an almost-new restaurant in an area it's tough to find anything nice in, and great 50's-diner atmosphere inside - not hokey and over the top like some retro diners, but just right. \n\nI can't recommend it more highly!"
"5","I went here yesterday and had a really great experience! \n\nI was on a mission to purchase a treadmill. I was over in the section for only a minute or two when Randy, a sales associate approached me and asked if I needed help. I asked him the few questions I had, satisfied with the answers I told him which one I wanted to purchase. \n\nHe rang me up and sent me on my way to the pick up area. \n\nThe pick up area is pretty dismal, but Sears goal is to not have you wait. you walk in and scan your receipt under a bar code reader, a monitor displays the progress of your order. In less then 50 seconds (And this is not an exaggeration, as the screen was counting down how long the process would take) Wes was walking through the double doors with my brand new treadmill! He loaded it up in my car and off I went! \n\nThe whole purchasing process from beginning to end was MAYBE 30 minutes total! Totally great experience!"
"3","My friend found this small Moroccan grocery and invited me to stop by for dinner. The interior consists of a grocery and clothing section, and a tiny dining area. There was not much of ambiance as we were the only visitors on that evening. It's a one-person operation and the owner does everything from kitchen to the floor. \n\nThe Harira ($3.99) came with lentils, tomatoes, garbanzo beans and cilantro soup. The blend of ingredients and spices made it zesty hearty with a good lift stemming from a mix of lentil and cilantro. It was a light opener and one item to consider for those looking for soups. \n\nThe Baba Ghannouge ($4.99) came with baked eggplant, sesame sauce, garlic, and lemon. The thick eggplant consistency was garlicky and addictive. The zesty lemony flavor nicely intertwined with the deepening sesame sauce. However, the bursts of eggplant flavors were held in check and in need to be more striking.\n\nThe Bamiah ($12.99) was put together with a large bulky piece of simmered lamb, saffron, okra, and a combination of spices. The okra was very tasty and nicely stewed. The outer-layer of the lamb had some dry spots, but otherwise it was tender and easy to fork into. The mix of spices could also be more intense and integrated. It was missing one note that could have brought it all together. \n\nThe Goat Tagine ($14.99) was culminated by a large bulky piece of goat with the bone in, saffron, and spices. The goat too, had some dry spots on the outside, but it was still very tender and easy to fork into. The aroma was sensational, but I wished the goat were seasoned better.\n\nOverall, the food was solid but not spectacular. There were some minor wow factors stemming from the soup and the wonder aroma of meat and spices. Despite the missing notes that could serve as a bridge between the meat and broth, but the drizzles were still very tasty when served on top of our generous servings of rice. \n\nService was very personable and friendly. It goes without saying, but the one-person operation will cause the food to take some time to arrive. I'd be very interested in coming back to try their good-looking Bastilla."
"3","The Starbucks inside the bookstore is own and operated by the bookstore and not by Starbucks, so any of your Starbucks GC will not be accepted there.  That was a bummed thing to hear.  Overall, the bookstore is pretty clean, bathroom is very clean too, at least that's what I saw when I visited them.  Location can be better as you can't see it from the main road."
"2","Just went back this weekend. Not as good as 1st few times. A little bit inconsistent...uh oh..inconsistency kills"
"2","After lasting one night in that spooky L Motel where strippers go to die- I was idiotic enough to take a referral to eat here. But I always give second chances, and this one failed.\n\nThe place was crowded on Monday morning (labor day). \n\nThe water was dirty and delayed to arrive at the table.\n\nThe table was dirty, and the silverware and napkins were absent. \n\nThe food was horrendous, and the eggs seemed like they'd been soaked in water after being scrambled. \n\nThe fruit bowl consisted of one grape, and two or three slimy melons. \n\nWe sat but did not eat. Paid the bill and sought refuge in Safeway's deli. \n\nWhen you're passing through town, get thee to the grocery. \n\nWaitress was super nice though, it wasn't her fault the meal was awful or the place was dirty."
"5","Dealer screwed up my ignition when bringing the car into them. Had it taken to Japanese Auto Pros to fix it.\n\nDealer wanted $1000, Japanese Auto Pros did it for $260 fixing the broken one the dealer screwed up.\n\nIt's amazing to know you have a quality auto shop near you incase something happens. So awesome."
"4","Went for a few drinks... in the evening this time ;) lol it was really relaxing and fun... there was a trash can fire... that was entertaining... the bartender was sweet and cool.. she kept coming over and hung out throughout the night... I only stayed till about 930 on a Tuesday... and it was pretty full for a Tuesday I'd say :) i cant wait to go back for the Halloween party :)"
"5","I have lived in Phoenix most of my life but had never lived in 'Dirty Phoenix' (West PHX east Glendale) as I call it and in the last year bought a house literally down the street from the place. So my first month in the house I am driving around finding where all the grocery stores are and such and drive right by this place called O'Brien's. It looked like a cool little dive bar which is my kind of place. \n\nO'Brien's is my hang out now. I love the place, the bartenders are all very cool and very quick with my favorite drink..Capt-n-Coke and the food is really good. Its not too big and not too small and you get all kinds inside. its not just a biker bar, or gay bar or metal bar..its just a good bar. Justine, Kat, Hope and Tara are awesome."
"3","Came for a drink after work before I went home to surprise and was told that if was going to pay by debit that I would have to spend $10 minimum. Why can't you pay for what you order regardless of what type of payment you use. Normally I would drink more than $10 worth but today happened to be a day that I can't stay long. And to top it off I asked if I could pay with cash for my one drink with cash, which you can but, the ATM was out of service... Normally I don't care but that I did..."
"1","I was disappointed to see the prior Yelp page removed - why? because it was accurate? This place (when it was at its prior location way back when) used to be cool, when there was a sense of community. They had flyers, local periodicals. Not anymore. And, not only that, they do readings directly in front of the tarot deck cabinet - l literally have to walk around the table to get to the tarot cards - so, I'm minding my own business looking for a deck, and I have to hear someone's personal stuff like. Um...hello? Isn't that a little bit unethical? \""For entertainment value\"" is one thing, but would you YouTube your appointments with your financial adviser or physician for everyone to see? I mean, c'mon...show some *bleep* respect for the people coming in to your store and give them a little privacy. I wouldn't want customers strolling by me if I came in for a reading. It's just tacky. Everything in this review is accurate and can be corroborated, and I'd be glad to re-post the same sentiment if the store tries to whitewash their Yelp page again. Namaste."
"2","Odd that they're a Greek place yet they have ravioli, texas toast, and other Italian items.\n\nThis place does have a locals only feel.  I felt that when I was waiting to place my order while the only server chatted about her granddaughter with a local woman at a nearby booth.\n\nInterior has a few Greek-themed pictures on the walls, but the booths date back to the 70's or so, and the chairs probably as well.  As other reviewers noted, this appears to be a sketchy part of town, so it can make one a bit uncomfortable.\n\nHummus was a bit gritty/lumpy, tasted a bit bland, and for some reason took a good 10 minutes or so to arrive even though the only other table in the restaurant already had their food.  Pita was dry, chewy, and tough.\n\nMaybe next time I'll go for the texas toast and ravioli instead."
"1","Don't waste your time or money, incredibly slow service. I get that its family owned however they need to get with the times and truly make a effort to connect with their guests, especially first time guests. Very disappointed."
"4","An old style family restaurant.  A very good value for the money.  My entire group liked the food.  A little bit of everything for everyone.  We ate Greek food, they also have Italian.  Can not vouch for the Italian as we all ate Greek Food."
"5","Down the street from my office, I love this place! The turkey bacon sandwich with lots of their spicy sauce is delicious! And the lady at the cashier always has a joke or pun to tell, makes a crappy day into a better one."
"3","What a long day!  We drove for five and a half hrs and finally made it.\n\nWe checked in at 3 pm after M's wedding.  I took a short nap and found the room to be cozy.  It had two nice swimming pools.  Unfortunately, I forgot my swimsuit since the night before I was running around the house like a mad woman trying to get my stuff together.  \n\nIf you're not planning to hang out at the hotel all day, then this place will do."
"1","This place is ghetto assf#*k! There are methers, prostitutes and scum that frequent this place, they do offer a AAA discount that brings the total to around $50 after tax. If you need a place to stay this will do, just don't leave your valuables in your vehicle.\n\nGood luck"
"4","I enjoy this place for the lunch buffet.  For production pizza I enjoy this pizza the most over Pappa Johns, Domino's, and Pizza Hut.  Price is fair for what you get.  \n\nOnly thing that troubles me is that I have seen people walk right in, go to the dining room area and then procede to the buffet line to help themselves without paying for anything.  There really does not seem to be any type of system established to prevent this type of thing.  I mentioned it to one of the managers one time but he seemed like he didn't care about it much.  His attitude was rather concerning.  Other then that  I am pleased with this place."
"2","just got a Peter Piper Pizza for the 1st time in awhile.  I don't know what happened but the crust IS NOT the same.  TOO BAD.  won't ever go back again.  i grew up in the Valley and I have never had a PPP like this.  the cheese is different, the crust is different.  WHY WHY WHY??? the wings are SORRY."
"3","Olive Garden........hmmmpphhh\n\nAs I'm not a huge fan of Olive Garden, I went. My buddy said his dad was in town and invited me to eat with them. I could use some unlimited breadsticks in my life right about now.  \n\nThe service was good not great. Our server got in an argument over the bill in the table behind us and was kind of rude and loud and disturbed our conversation. That was a little annoying, but not that big of a deal. The food came out 20 mins after we ordered and she almost served one of our pints to a different table, probably cause she was flustered over the argument.\n\nI had the Chicken Marsala, it was not bad.  I was pretty hungry so I probably ate more than I normally would have. The peppers and onions were a little overcooked, the onions weren't bad but the peppers were almost black.  The marsala wasn't bad and the mushrooms were delicious.  Chicken....Ehhh, not bad.\n\nLocation is a little iffy, kinda out of the way from where we're staying this week but wasn't that bad. It's kind of behind the main streets in the area, (peoria)"
"3","This location gets 2 Stars. The restaurant was NOISY, & had a low-class of people. We had to change tables because the one we got was obnoxiously noisy with loud children nearby. I wish parents would make their kids behave in public, plus it was 8:30 pm & little kids s/b in bed by then, at least  I was at that age. Anyway, we did get moved to a quieter table. The service & food was great, but I recommend the Scottsdale location over this location by far...."
"4","This Olive Garden just moved across the way to a brand new building located at 2710 W North Lane Phoenix AZ 85021. it's been open about a week.  At first we couldn't find it with our GPS since it is so new.   We went there Nov 27 (tues) 2012\n\nWe arrived around 1pm as a party of 4 adults for lunch.   They sat us on the left side near the entrance at the 1st booth.  Thought it would be noisy, but overall it was okay.\n\nOur Servers were friendly, attentive and very conversational, one of our members is a talker and our server enjoyed chatting with him.\n\nThey had a special 2 for $25, but we weren't that impressed with the special.  We ordered off of the lunch menu.  we ordered the following\n\nCYO appetizer sampler 3: Calamari, stuffed mushrooms & Fried Zucchini\n\nMain lunch courses:\nLasagna Classico\nBraised Beef Tortelloni\nLinguine alla Marinara\nChicken Caprese Panini\n\nDessert:  Zeppolis\n\nWe also ordered two dishes to go, even though not on the lunch menu,  they were accommodating and prepped the to go items for us from the dinner menu.\n\nChicken Parmigiana with [Fettuccine Alfredo (substituted)]\nChicken Marsala\n\nWe first only ordered the sampler appetizer, and after it came out is when we ordered the rest of our meal.  That made the lunch more enjoyable, not rushed and our main meals were piping hot.\n\nThe Salad came out cold and crisp as usual.  Bread sticks were a little delayed about 5 minutes, they ran out, so we got them fresh out of the oven when they were ready.  Our servers were very good at refilling our drinks.\n\nThe whole lunch experience was very good, food tasty. First time I tried their braised beef tortelloni and was delicious.  Wasn't sure what to expect. The Beef about 4 or 5 slices is served with the tortelloni.  By the way, I always thought it was tortellini.  The server told me Tortelloni is bigger size wise.\n\nWe also had Zeppoli with chocolate sauce.  They sprinkled liberally the powder sugar on the Zeppoli.  These Zeppoli were rectangular and texture is more firm than doughnuts.  We enjoyed them immensely and will order them again in the future. \n\nAs Olive Garden restaurant, it was a good experience. I think being a new building everyone was excited.  Go and enjoy yourselves, we did."
"5","I am writing this more for the manager Kelli than for the restaurant or our server. We actually had pretty bad service, though we did not get a chance to complain about it. We were seated quickly, and our service seemed very new at his job.  We were there for lunch.  We ordered our food and received soups and salad before drinks.  We were finished with our soups and salads before we caught the attention of another server who came to our aid and apologized for us not having our drinks yet.  She alerted the manager as we did not complain, just asked for our drinks.  Drinks came and then our entrees.  Our server came by a couple times and apologized but was still very weak at his job.  Hopefully he is given another chance and receives more training before his next guest arrives.  The 5 stars go to Kelli though for just coming out of nowhere and comping our meal.  Having a meal for free is very nice, but considering we didn't even complain but that she took the initiative to make sure that we were taken care of and happy with our experience - that's why she gets the 5 stars.  Great job Kelli - keep up the good work!"
"1","This place was filthy!! \nWe ate at a Sizzlers in Cottonwood, AZ 2 days before, and we liked it soo much we decided to look for one close to our Phoenix hotel. Since there are only 2 Sizzlers in Phoenix, we picked this one and arrived  aroung 6.30 pm. We entered this place and were kind of welcomed by a grumpy manager( that should have been a sign), placed our order, and looked for a clean table. We found 1 in a corner, the rest wasn't cleaned.\nWe took our plastic!!!! plates, and went to the salad-bar. Several trays were empty, and were not refilled. The fries were cold, there was food everywhere on the floor. I ate my steak, which was ok, my wife didn't eat anything, i drank my Coke(no refills??!!), asked for the bill, and went to the bathroom. Oh my God.......no words for this experience.\nNever again in this dump. \nThey should go to Cottonwood to learn how to run a restaurant in a proper way."
"2","Salad bar was really good including peel and eat shrimp but the fish and chips were AWFUL.  Three tiny pieces that looked like they came out of a fish sticks box from the grocery freezer section.  So disappointing.  Either do it right or take it off the menu."
"2","we've heard a lot about this place, and finally went there, and it kind of sucked. hardly any sauces, and it's totally ugly inside. also, i'm not sure if the girl working at the front is even old enough to avoid child labor laws.\n\ntheir pineapple was bad.\n\nlai lai is way better, and so is genghis grill. avoid this place."
"2","= = = = = =  DAILY LUNCH BUFFET!  = = = = = =\n\nStopped in here for lunch today with Norm R.  The descriptions of the place in Scott & Iain's reviews mostly matched what I saw, so I won't cover the same ground again.  This veggie selection is a little larger than you usually see at a (no extra charge) Mongolian BBQ within a Chinese buffet restaurant, but you pay a lot here & yet miss out on the 50 to 100 other items you would have had available at the Chinese place.  Also, the Chicken Vegetable Soup was only lukewarm.\n\nLunch:  $7.39 (no seconds allowed), or $8.39 (seconds ok).  All in all it was ok, once."
"1","Absolutely one of the worst mongolian bbq's I have ever had. The night I stopped in for take out.. I proceeded thru the fix ur bowl line as per normal, but to discover this frozen weird looking assortment of meat? No shrimp... I opted for the cod. I was happy with the veggie assortment and I made the 'spicy sauce' recipe as the sign indicated. I thought $8.50 for a take out box that wasn't full was a bit pricey . When I finally got it home, I couldn't finish it, it was that awful. Guess I will drive across town to my fav mongolian bbq in Tempe the next time I get the urge for that!"
"2","Not a fan.  Pretty sure I was waiting for a food poisoning experience.  It was clean, I will acknowledge that.  But I am not sure about the frozen lunch meat you are offered.  It seemed gross and chewy.\n\nNo flavor after adding 10 ladles of sauces.  It was a miracle we survived, since we only went based on our GPS and not reviews.\n\nLesson learned......read Yelp!"
"2","Chuck E Cheese is our typical Friday outing.  We had an activity in south Phoenix so on our way home we stopped at the closest one.  This was our first time at the one.  The good thing is they had different machines then the other ones we go to.  But the one thing my daughter loves about Chuck E Cheese is \""Chuck E Cheese\"". At this one I almost had to become Chuck E myself, we almost had to force them to bring Chuck E out. We got there at 5pm, we were about to leave and they finally brought him out.  So we she did get to see him but almost by force."
"4","This place has been here forever and every few years I like to come in for dessert. I had the James Dean Sundae. Very good creamy ice cream and tasty Caramel. The waitress was pleasant and friendly enough. Didn't try any food as this really is a place for ice cream desserts with the feel of an old fashioned parlor. Beats Dairy Queen hands down for a few more $$$ and more relaxing than any of the chains like Cold Stone Creamery or B&R."
"1","If I could give no stars I would. Service was terrible, waitress was not friendly, never came back to see if we needed anything, waited a long time to get the bill, she never came back, had to flag someone else to pay.  \nNow the food, it was very skimpy, piece of boneless chicken was barely 2 inches long and had no flavor, mashed potatoes must have come out of a box. This dinner came with a sundae that consisted of melted vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce. Had to flag down another waitress to get this as my waitress had disappeared. \nThe prices are very high for what you get, I have went here for the last time."
"1","I was with a large group today (10 people) and a few minutes after we sat down a HUGE sewer roach crawled across my foot! I jumped up and screamed. Next thing you know it made it's way down the line and crawled over three of my friend's feet! Finally, we stepped on it and ran and got the waitress. Gross. This is no reflection on the waitress - she was very apologetic - but seriously, a happy group reunion turned into a total gross out. We all wondered what was creeping around in the kitchen that we couldn't see! The Mimi's in Scottsdale is nice, this location is dirty and the a/c in the back room where we were seated was turned up. We were all sweating. (It was 93 outside today). I think the roach was trying to escape to the air conditioned side of the restaurant! Will never go back to this location."
"3","Would be higher rated if they accepted cards, how old school is that to pay an extra fee to drink?\n\nWell rounded sports bar with tables and darts and plenty of TV's\n\nDecent staff depending on what girl you get help from.\n\nhas people in it every night of the week and never seems dead, that's why the boys and I stop by after the night shift.\n\nworth the time, and the adventure. Good mix of crowd"
"1","This is a horrible car wash.  The manager / owner is extremely rude and the quality of the work is terrible.   I would never waste the money to return here.  They only are concerned with up selling detail packages and not with the quality of car washes done."
"3","This location closing.  Going out of business sale going on now (9/2013).  if the parking lot was this packed all the time they would not be closing.  I don't hate Wmart, I just hate being left with nothing but Wmart."
"2","my children have been patients for 20 years but, sadly, things have changed. Customer service is less a focus...my  daughter had her first bladder infection and I tried to get her in...nurse never called back, when I went to the office to get help they wouldn t let me leave a specimen and told me she d have to wait for the next morning for an appt..then when I called for office manager to discuss my frustration she never called back either....Disturbing! I will be picking up my records and changing doctors..."
"4","I used AZ Chimney Sweep to clean our dryer ducts.  They did a good job, although they didn't really need cleaning but that was my fault.  We had the dryer vent ducts cleaned a couple of years ago.  I noticed alot of lint, and thought it would just be ready to clean again.\n\nHe did say that we should have to clean again for another 5 years or so.  However, just beware of the extra thirty dollars they sell you on the flex seal hose.  I thought that was a rip off, but I did need a new hose.  I think that for the amount of hose I needed and the 125.00 that I paid them, they could have just NOT CHARGED for a small piece of hose.  I think this flex hose is a real money maker form them.  It probably only costs them pennies on the dollar.  Anyway, that's business.\n\nOther than that, I did like the company."
"1","This is 60 minutes of my life that regretfully I will never get back and would like to!!  If there was the ability to rate this \""no or negative stars\"" I would.\n\nWe went to Fry's Electronics based on a friend's recommendation to purchase a laptop. Our friend had the very best intentions in helping us find the best laptop for the very best price possible.  He recommended a particular sales person, however they were not there when we arrived. Now I know my friend had a a good experience with this particular person so I thought seeking help from someone else would be OK...\n\nSo my story begins:\n\nWe have never been to Fry's so when we pulled up to this huge retailer looking like a Mian Temple my son got real excited thinking this would be like a \""Raiders of the Lost Ark\"" adventure, but we are looking for a laptop and not an Ark. \n\nAs we entered the store we were appalled at the grotesque Halloween display they had set up in the entry way.  It was this life sized zombie looking thing that was cut in half and crawling around on the floor.  It was so NOT APPROPRIATE and scared every little child that walked in. \n\nWe quickly walked past it to the computer area.  We enter the laptop area and walked past five employees.  No one said a word to us even though they made eye contact.  We stood in front of the laptops waiting for someone to show an interest in us, but no one did. I finally interrupted a conversation three of them were having together to ask for help.  They told us they would call someone to help us??? They weren't helping anyone. \n\nAs we were looking at the very tacky signs they had posted on all their laptops informing their customers about their 10% restocking fee, finally one of them came over and asked us if we had any questions.  I was looking for a laptop they had in their ad and was wanting to compare it to another laptop they had in their ad a week ago.  When I asked about these laptops he actually stated \""the one from last week's ad is not on display and the other laptop you are asking about is over there and pointed\"" then he walked off to help someone else!  So another person finally approached us and asked us the same thing.  He was more helpful but in the middle of his sales pitch we were interrupted by one of his colleagues and he left us and said he would be right back but never came back!  I asked a third person if they could help us only to be interrupted again by yet another sales person. He walked off with this person and started helping someone else on his way back to us....\n\nWe finally asked to speak to a manager and the person that called told us it would be just a minute.  After waiting 10 minutes to speak to someone that wanted to sell us a laptop, the manager never showed up.  The person that paged the manager just looked at us and never followed up nor apologized. \n\nI was beginning to think we were on some type of reality TV show where they \""pushed your buttons\"" just enough until you break and throw a \""smack down\"" on someone.  So we literally looked around to see if we were being taped.  We completely wasted an hour of our time and left.  We walked past five more people on the way out and no one acknowledged us...\n\nSo we went to Best Buy, dreading the experience and delightfully surprised!  We were acknowledged throughout the store and the sales person was the BEST!  They were very helpful and offered to match any price from Fry's.  To top it off, Best Buy doesn't charge a restocking fee should we need to do a return.\n\nI am just baffled as to why anyone would buy anything from Fry's Electronics... HUGE WASTE OF TIME!"
"4","As a consumer of electronics, I like this place. I was in a lack-luster relationship with Best Buy and we were only in it until something better came along. Fry's is my something better. They really do have everything:TV, video, audio, car stereos, computers, appliances, gaming, magazines, toys...and a cafe in the middle-not that that was the deal breaker. \nThey always seem to have specials on DVDs which I think is cool but be careful-that $25 you were planning on spending can easily turn into $200. This really is a one-stop shop for the geek in all of us."
"4","WHOA!  So many things to look at and buy!!!  You can find almost anything electronics there and at many price points.  \n\nI need limit my visits here to save my wallet's life.  LOL!"
"1","Dear Shitty Floor Manager at Fry's,\n\nI know that your store's prices are cheaper than almost any place locally. There's a reason I'm buying my MacBook there. However, this does not give you carte blanche to act like a total dick when I don't buy your warranty, nor does it mean you should make me wait 15 minutes just for you to go grab a laptop (one which you yourself admitted you were overstocked on).\n\nWhen someone approaches you in the middle of our conversation to tell you that the keyboard you directed them toward was located in a completely different section of the store than where you sent them, this means you should apologize. It does not mean you should roll your eyes at them.\n\nAnd when I say thanks and begin to walk away, you probably should keep in mind that I can hear you when you tell me \""good luck\"" in reference to my not buying your stupid warranty. The reason I don't want your warranty is because it means I would have to come back and talk to you. I've never broken a laptop in my life, and I'm not going to break this one either. So do your job and shut your mouth.\n\nLove,\n-Kevin\n\nPS: Young polite girl at register, you're A-OK."
"4","Kim took care of me. I had powder acrylic on and the last tech messed them up. She put liquid gels on for me. My hands feel clean and pretty. Thank you."
"5","I bought my Specialized mountain bike several years ago at Exhale. I took it in recently for some mechanical issues. They were knowledgable with integrity, especially since I'm mechanically challenged.  They explained what needed done with estimates that were fair and reasonable. They even expressed changes that will help me with my riding goals.  Thanks Exhale!!!"
"3","Only 8 calories an ounce for yummy creamy indulgence that won't have the buttons popping off your shirt! They have flavors that rotate and for the full fat full flavor seekers they serve Thrifty ice cream as well. I personally feel their small is big enough. Open late, friendly too. Ask for a sample as some flavors are great and others to me are just so so."
"2","I went here on Thursday May 1st, 2014. The two girls that were working on this day were sitting at a table with their friends when my sister and I walked in. One of them reluctantly stood up to help us while the other stayed seated. The employee acted like it was such a chore to help us. Instead of letting us browse she followed us every step of the way in an attempt to make us hurry up and order. In summary, the customer service was bad, the ice cream was great."
"1","This has always been a last resort for me when re-selling my clothes. I will usually take my stuff to Plato's Closet, which gives the same in trade or cash, then Buffalo Exchange, then Other Mother's. The last few times I've cleaned out my closet, I've opted donating my rejects instead of re-selling to Other Mother's because they pretty much give you pennies for your items. Yesterday, I decided to try them out one more time and I was more insulted than ever. Taking two pair of name brand jeans, an unworn shirt with tags still on, and 5 pieces of jewelry...they gave me a whopping six dollars and some change in cash! I would much rather donate my clothes to someone in need than to get ripped off by this store ever again!"
"5","The evening started with a long drive from Chandler and a 40 minute wait for a table.  (This hole in the wall has 6 tables and one waiter who I assume to be the owner.)  Surprisingly, I did not mind the inconveniences at all.  Probably because of the good company.  Probably because you just cannot be impatient with the little gentleman running around tirelessly to serve all the tables with sincerity and a bit of humor.  \n\nI have never had Ecuadorian food before, but I assume this place is authentic.  The food and the decor is what I imagine eating at an Ecuadorian grandmother's house would be.  Every thing that I tasted was terrific.  Some items I tried were the Colombiana soda, shrimp ceviche, fish in banana leaf, and shrimp stew.\n\nLast note, this restaurant is not for the faint of heart.  The wait for food is long, but well worth it.  It warmed my heart when the chef (the gentleman's wife?) came out to thank us for coming and wished us a happy new year.  I will definitely return to try the tamales.  You cannot find this food anywhere else in Phoenix."
"5","I've only tried their Ecuadorian Tamales and La Bandeja Paisa, but if the rest of their food is half as good as those two things, this place is still 5 stars. The Ecuadorian Tamale was especially good.\n\nHow people can walk into the Taco Bell when this place is right behind it, is beyond me. \n\nFirst time trying plantains as well. I'm a fan."
"3","We went here for dinner last night.  After leaving our house in CenPho around 6:30, we arrived home around 10:30.  Traffic was normal.  \n\nThe place was full when we arrived a little after 7, but a table became available 10 minutes after we arrived.  Save for a party of two, none of the people sitting in the restaurant had food.  Understandably, we were last in the queue for a full house, but we didn't even get drinks until 8:30.   That means we had to sit under fluorescent lights with nothing but a screaming baby to soothe our nerves.  It felt like waiting for your name to get called in an emergency room.  \n\nOver the course of the evenng, three other parties arrived after we did, and their wait for food and drink was not as long.  I understand that timing is everything and we probably came at the worst possible time.   That said, after reading other Yelpers say that service was slow, we had no way of knowing that \""slow\"" meant we would wait more than an hour for drinks, more than 1.5 hours for appetizers, and about 2 hours for food.  Under fluorescent lights.  With a boor or two yelling nearby.\n\nAm I complaining about service?  No, because the old man that ran the joint did all that he could.  He was as sweet as can be.  It just may be that a little place like this cannot handle all the business from all the buzz. \n\nThe Ecuadorian fish ceviche was unbelievably good and hearty.  Seco de chivo (goat stew) was tasty.  Love the plaintains.  The merlot was surprisingly good (no burn going down despite the low price tag of $4.50/glass).  We had 3 kinds of empanadas -- two were okay, one was not good.  Hubby's steak was flavorful but tough.  \n\nThe food is worth the price and I strongly suspect that the kitchen performs better when the place is not packed to the gills.  I would come back if I am nearby, but a taco from Taco Bell beforehand would probably improve matters."
"5","Be sure to put this one on your \""must try\"" list if you are a fan of authentic ethnic food! \n\nMenu is extensive with chiefly Ecuadorian, Peruvian, and Colombian dishes. Even the drink and dessert menu boasts authentic dishes you will not find just anywhere. \n\nPortions were generous, food was served hot, and the presentation of the serving made me feel like I was away on a brief vacation! \n\nOur server appeared to be the owner. He was genuinely friendly as well as attentive. \n\nWait time for the meal was under 30 minutes, which is what I would reasonably expect for a homestyle restaurant with good food made to order. \n\nIf you are looking for an appetizer, I recommend pork empanadas. They are reminiscent of the meat pies you will find throughout many countries in Latin America. \n\nMeats are well represented on the menu. You will find beef, chicken, pork, goat, fish, and shrimp dishes to suit most tastes. Seasoning is just right, and the homemade salsa was served on the side of my entree in a little ceramic cup, which was tasty and spicy enough to satisfy my craving for heat. \n\nThe tamales as well as the fish are steamed in a banana leaf (typical of Central and South America). The flavor the banana leaf lends to the steamed dish is uniquely different (in case you are not familiar, the banana leaf is not edible). \n\nMost dishes are served with fried plantains, which are out of this world! \n\nDinner prices are reasonable and range from $6.99 to $11.89 per entree. \n\nThe restaurant is very small and the decor is simple and native of the region of cuisine, which adds to the true feel of the experience. \n\nMy gut reaction is to keep returning and eventually try everything on the menu. Our party had the same exact reaction as the previous reviewer as we walked out of the restaurant. \""How does anybody stop at the Taco Bell across the parking lot?\"""
"5","If my world were calorie and cholesterol free, I'd dine every day on the trout.  Not to mention the coconut flan!  If you don't try that flan on one of your visits I pity your taste buds.  Food is always hot and fresh.  Server is usually the same and pretty friendly.  The guy will work his buns off to make you happy.  Meals are reasonably priced but worth the bit of splurge.  What to try?  The Ecuadorean tamales, the trout and the coconut flan.  You will love the red onion relish - I could eat that stuff every day!"
"4","Delicious! Small hole in the wall, slow service but owned and operated by the cutest little couple! Your in for a treat here!"
"5","Mi Comida is wonderful. I love everything about it! Well, OK there are a few down-sides to a very small mom and pop spot like this, but the benefits far outweigh them. \n\nThere are very few tables here, and service is sort of slow, so be prepared to wait if you come during a busy time or with a group larger than 4. You can hardly be upset about it, though, because the older man who is always working the dining room is such a... well, he's CUTE. OK? I said it. He's adorable. I have no idea who works in the kitchen, but I like to imagine it's his little wife of 50 years, cooking exactly the way her mom taught her. \n\nThe food is delicious. DELICIOUS. It's not always sophisticated, but the flavor never disappoints. I've had several things from the menu and have loved each one. My absolute favorite is the maduros, which always manage to be perfectly ripened, sweet and crisp around the edges. \n\nIn short... eat here. Do it."
"3","We went to this place with my husband to see if they had any Argentinean empanadas, or argentinean dough to make them, but they do not have anything Argentinean , it is all Ecuatorian , it is really good food. \nBut we were looking for Argentinean , anyway is good. I did not like the meat, very spicy , and we Argentineans do not like spicy food."
"2","Nothing to see here really.  Not much on tap beyond the white trash specialties.  The menu is huge, so much so that it's convoluted.  They're just trying to do too much.  The service usually blows, cause it's staffed by burned out looking skanks, and I'm being nice here.  On the weekend it packs full of douchebags who are engaged in mortal douchebaggery.  it's the kind of place you could get into a fight in when you're not looking for trouble.  Everyone seems to be posturing around here.  I remember when this place first opened up before it expanded 3 times.  It started as an old dudes sports joint now it's a drink special douche attractant.  \n\nI wouldn't go here unless forced to.  Ohe yeah the drinks aren't cheap here either, unless there's a special."
"2","So I recently moved to Arizona from Los Angeles, and this place is close to my home, and had some great specials during the Lakers vs Suns games. The only reason this place got 2 stars instead of 1 is because they had $5 large pizzas and $2.50 you call its (except for top shelf). The crowd this place attracts is sooo ghetto and beligerent. They were giving away shirts that said \""F*#K The Lakers\"" on it. My boyfriend, 1 other table, and I were the only Lakers fans...which we expected. Everyone is wearing their stupid shirts thinking the Suns actually had a chance. It is here I realized how lame and dumb people can be. They were walking aorund making LA signs with their fingers saying \""Leave Arizona\"" people were trying to start fights with the Lakers fans because they said  \""LA sucks\"" then I asked why and they said \""well, I've never been there, but it just is lame\"". So I deal with these rude obnoxious people til the end of the series, which of course the Lakers win! I just laughed at the Suns fans who bandwagoned onto Celtics fans because they were so butt-hurt about Phoenix losing. Cry me a freakin river! So there's stike 1.\n\nStrike 2 is that it literally takes FOREVER to get a drink in this place! We even timed it and it took 10 minutes to get drinks when the place was not even half full! We figured you should order your next drink when you get your first so by the time you are done, you're second drink MIGHT be brought to you soon. The food is okay, nothing special at all, but not disgusting. There are also many children in here playing pool, air hockey, and the basketball game while people are getting wasted & partying. It's just weird. They also took part in cussing people out when their parents were getting into it with other people. Wow just wow.\n\nStrike 3 came the other night when we showed up to eat because we had a coupon & ended up playing trivia. The trivia was fun, until the table behind us (full of people 45 years and older) were cussing, yelling, and harassing the girl who was hosting the trivia. She was getting pissed, and so were we. We lost 1 question because they kept bothing all of us. Casey Jones is a place you can go to and play trivia at 7pm and be harassed by geezers who get too drunk & act 21. I have also heard stories about my friends who have gone & people started fights with them for no reason. The people were friends with the owner or bartender, so my friends got kicked out & not the people who started the fight! I would not recommend this place at all. Go to Padre Murphy's down the street or somewhere else. Anywhere else."
"4","Brayden and shaun Will def take care if you"
"1","Let me start by saying this bar is right by my house so I was hoping that this would be a good one. The first time I went there it was a decent experience, but it seems that things are going down hill. There have been several times when we ordered premium drinks (Jack or Captain) and it seems that they are serving us well drinks but still charged us the premium price! Trust me, I'm a very experienced drinker and know the difference from well whiskey and Jack. The last time my friend and I went there we went in and sat at a table and never got acknowledged. We were there for over 15 minutes and not one waiter or waitress stopped by and they weren't even busy! We finally ended up leaving went to another bar. I won't be back."
"1","Don't shop at Lowe's unless you feel like getting the bait and switch. Deceptive business practices is an understatement here!\n\nLong story short: We're completing a major landscaping project and, even though Lowe's is literally 5 minutes away from our house, we ordered some concrete, blocks, etc. so that it could all be delivered at once without us making multiple trips.\n\nSo it costs $80 for delivery, without regard to how much or how little you purchase, or how close you are to the store (again, we are FIVE MINUTES away). But that's fine! We expect to be charged for delivery, and we had a Christmas gift card, so no big deal.\n\nThis is important: When we completed our order online (over $400 worth), no where did it say we would be charged any more. $300+ for our items and $80 for delivery, and that was it.\n\n40 minutes later, we get a call for scheduling. This is when we're told there is a $15 \""pallet fee\"" for our order - what??? \n\nApparently, Lowe's is under the impression that we're going to steal their piece of crap, cheap pallets, so they charge you for pallets. We would have had 3-4 pallets worth of items delivered, a charge of $45-60 in fees. Oh, but they would \""waive\"" the fees once we brought the pallets back.\n\nOkay, so, let's recap:\n\n1. Delivery fee of $80 but crappy pallets are an extra $15 a pallet? Wtf is that delivery fee for then? A 20 year old rando dropping off stuff on our driveway???\n2. I have to bring you back your stupid pallets... when I ordered online for delivery. Hmm, what does that tell you? That I DON'T want to waste time going to Lowe's.\n\nWhat are we supposed to do, hang around customer service with our 3-4 pallets? Oh, because I love wasting time trying to get money back you extorted out of me. Love doing that on the few, precious vacations day I have. That's why I ordered for delivery in the first place...\n\nWhen we disputed this charge (which, to remind you, wasn't mentioned AT ALL in the fine print, so... bait and switch tactic), the manager was rude and ended up hanging up on us.\n\nClassy, manager! Please, hang up on customers who have already spent over $5,000 at Lowe's and who had planned to spend a lot more. Btw - this isn't about a $45 fee. It's not about the money - it's about deceptive practices and incredibly poor customer service. \n\nI know Lowe's doesn't care about the reviews they receive, but I hope you as a customer will make better choices. If you need landscaping materials, go to Pioneer Sand Company. We've worked with them before and they're great - they'll be getting all our landscaping business from here on!"
"5","Great Food....\n\nGood Service\n\nExcellent Management\n\nGood Drinks\n\n115 tv's (guesstimate)"
"1","Closed kitchen early because they were slow.  Manager \""Johnny\"" is a loser. We had a groupon and he would not honor it.  Hate to say this but we would never try this place again even though we lost 17.50."
"5","The wings are to die for, atmosphere is nice, crowded but spacious enough to eat and be comfortable. I couldn't see the menu cause it's a little dark. Lol prices are great."
"4","We have eaten here twice. Both times hamburgers. They were very good. Service was very good. Atmosphere was very noisy."
"4","Yum! Came here for Happy Hour on a Friday.\n\nI would have given this place 5 stars if the beers on the menu were actually the beers they offered. I asked for Moose Drool since it was on the menu, but the waitress said they didn't have it and rattled off the beers they DO have. Nothing irritates me more than having something on the menu but not actually having it available.\n\nThe Giovanni Wings were out of this world. So flavorful. Just the right amount of crispness. Delicious!\n\nPrices weren't bad at all. I'll definitely be back!"
"5","Hey Santisi Family & team. I am slow to update, but I just had to fill you in.  A few weeks ago I came in with my 2 nieces. It was quite early & I think it was a Tuesday. There was only a hand full of people at the bar. The bartender was extremely curtious & very patient as my kids wanted to run around & play video games and not tell us what they wanted to eat. Anyways, I ordered 2 orders of chicken strips & fries, a salad & sprites to share between us. First off, you have, by far, the very BEST tasting chicken strips I have ever tasted. Not kidding guys! The chicken was really juicy and the breading is very tasty & perfectly crispy. \nI don't think they are the same as I used to get, but either way....whatever you are doing differently...keep doing it!  We absolutely Loved them! And, WOW... the portions were HUGE! We couldn't even finish one order of them.  Now, your Ranch dressing is so delicious that the girls only want it from \""'Tisi's\"" & they want to eat it on everything! Lol.  Your BBQ sauce is great & mixed with the ranch dressing was quite yummy... Folks you have gotta try them together on a salad. I swear it was soooo good. \nBut, the Giovanni sauce is just so damn amazing that it can be poured on anything & everything! I eat it on my salad, wings, ribs, chicken breast dinner, even dip my pizza crust in it. You name it.... It's incredible! \nSo, can't you bottle this stuff?"
"1","I ordered a birthday cake with vanilla butter cream icing and white cake. When I picked it up it was decorated nicely, however after trying the cake the icing had no vanilla flavor at all it tasted like Crisco and sugar and the cake was dry. I will not be going back here."
"2","Since I just signed up a week ago, I'm sure I'll have to update this later. But I thought I would at least log my first impressions.\n\nFirst off, when we called, we got the usual sales tactics. The guy was really reluctant to give us a straight answer about how much membership costs, and how much the initiation fee is, and all that jazz. He also kept pressuring us to come in and talk with him.\n\nSadly, his tactics worked. \n\nWe headed on over there to check it out. It being around 5 or 6pm, the place was utterly packed. We had to park kind of far. But we're trying to get into shape, so what's a little extra walking?\n\nInside, it looks like it was built 15+ years ago. Miami Vice paint colors, neon signage, and the dents and scuffs on the walls and furniture that come with daily wear-and-tear. It wasn't shabby looking, just broken in. It actually made the place seem less intimidating, like when a burly guy wears a sweater.\n\nThe clientele looks like a bunch of average joes. The equipment isn't the latest and greatest. But they do the job. There are no spa-like perks or fancy decor. The place's mission is to work with average folks and get them into shape. It seemed like the perfect fit for us.\n\nOur sales guy chatted with us for a bit, gave us the tour, and then took our measurements and weight. We sat down. discussed the membership options, and picked the one that suited us. It wasn't a steal of a deal, but it wasn't bad either.\n\nOnce all the paperwork was signed, and the credit cards run, we scheduled our first two training sessions (free!). Here we hit a snag. \n\nRight from the start, we said we wanted mornings. We are morning people. We are motivated in the morning. We don't like being around hordes of people, like they have in the evenings.\n\nThe guy with \""The Book\"" told us that there were no trainers available in the morning for several weeks. Typical. We clashed over that for a while, but eventually caved. We're stuck with evening training sessions for the time being.\n\nWe just did our first free session, and had varying experiences. We were both scheduled the same trainer, but he wasn't there. So we each got a different guy.\n\nMy girlfriend loved her trainer. He gave her a tough -- but not too tough -- workout, motivating her throughout. He made suggestions about her nutrition, and didn't really try to sell her on the supplements.\n\nMy guy was very nice, and pretty laid back. Almost too laid back. My workout was pretty easy. He didn't go over some of the basics of weight training. Luckily I knew them already. We didn't discuss nutrition very much. He did try to sell me on supps, but not really hard. My session was also about 15 minutes short.\n\nWe're going to be working out on our own next week. We'll see how that goes."
"3","Service was great.  Food was good not great.  I can't say I was a big fan of the atmosphere.  Kind of dark and dingy.  I'd go again but this restaurant probably wouldn't be my first pick."
"5","Pizza by Napoli will always have a place in my heart. I have been frequenting this place for over 7 years now and NOT ONCE has it compromised in taste, style or service. I know when I go there years from now, I will get to enjoy every reason that makes this place special for me. Taste-wise, I can speak for the pizza, wings and beer as this is all I ever want when I go...BECAUSE THERE SO DAMN GOOD!!! The pizza has an amazing taste to the sauce that can only be experienced and that will hopefully one day be recognized as the sauce all pizza should use! The wings have a nice crunchiness but are still traditionally bathed in an awesome wing sauce and worth every bit of mess you make of yourself. The beer is served right and makes the food that much better. When I say served right; I'm speaking of the thick, LARGE, glass pitcher that you could use to battle any incoming zombies or just use it to fill up the ice dripping mugs! Keep in mind, this place has a huge menu so don't think there only as good as pizza and wings. Best of all is it is very affordable as I have never thought I paid too much and if your looking for a cheap lunch special, they have it! As for atmosphere, it is very down to earth, no frills, just some beer signs and simple pictures of Napoli or some far off Italian hillside. The exact same group of guys has been there every time I have went and I actually don't know if they ever leave. Every time you see them they are cleaning or breaking down some machine to clean because it took a beating during lunch time. These guys have an awesome \""tough as nails\"" Italian attitude and can come off pushy when placing your order for lunch but for god sake it's lunch time; it's busy, live with it! For dinner, you order it up front and then they bring it to you instead of picking it up from the front and don't worry, at this time the guys are all very gracious. Overall, this place is a classic and if your looking for great pizza in Phoenix; this is your place, if you just feel like something a little better for a pizza to take home; this is your place; if you want a genuine, down to earth experience; this is your place!"
"4","I've been coming here for years. I like to stop by when I have to make a Fry's Electronics run. My favorite, beside a slice and salad, is their eggplant parm sandwich. I think they are one of the best in the in the Valley. (See my photo) I order the eggplant sandwich with a side of pepperchinies. Highly recommended. \n\nStaff is always friendly. A real family operated business, and always\nfriendly."
"5","I dropped by King Gyros after reading the raving reviews about this place. Now I know why! Their gyros are delicious and super cheap. It's kind of a hole in the wall place, but that made me even more fond of it. The staff was very friendly. I wish I lived closer to this place - it would definitely become one of my regular joints!"
"4","Alright. So I realize this is a gyro business, and yes they are reaaaaaally delicious....however I have to give most of the credit to their burgers. Burgers? At a gyro place? YES! And let me tell you, they have the best burgers anywhere. Homemade meat they grind in house and the flavor...o.m.g. So good. The meal will run you about 9 bucks, but lets be honest... I will pay anything for a good burger. Do it..get one and tell me how amazing it is. I dare you!"
"4","If you follow any of my reviews you will see I am attempting to try every Gyro place I pass by.  I have easily eaten at 30-40 unique shops and each has their ups and downs but few have the complete package for me. Kings is no exception.  I would say they have the best Tzatziki of any place I've eaten at locally.  They use the same Pitas as most good places do.  Yet they lost me with the generic borderline grocery store frozen fries.  The establishment is nice, they people are nice.  I would have dropped a fifth star if the fries had not bored me."
"4","Nice place, clean, spacious room."
"4","How have I never reviewed this place before? It's close by so I do come here. Like once a month I show up. \n\nIt has that great dimly lit dive bar feel. You know you could get laid if you wanted to.  The drinks are cheap and the bartenders are cool. \n\nI like the people most.... you get such a fun variety the normal alcoholics, people in their work clothes, people hoping not to run into anyone they know, and plenty of stoners. Being a semi attractive girl the mostly male patrons treat you like you are family.... the creepy kind they want to kiss... but still family.   You can be relaxed and grab a few beers or get good and drunk either way you will fit  fit in just fine. \n\nIt's worth a trip and when the drunk people get kicked out of Santisi Brothers they walk to the other side if the parking lot and come here.  If nothing else grab a beer and watch the people that come here. \n\nAlso I might note that they only have 1 stall for women but there is often no line and MOST the time it does not smell like farts and coochie."
"3","Service was excellent.  I couldn't believe how fast they served my lunch.  Food was good and reasonably priced.  I liked that they brought out a side plate with fried won tons like a Mexican restaurant would tortilla chips.  I ordered kung pao shimp and cleaned my plate. Decor ah...as long as the food and service are good dated decor isn't a showstopper."
"5","Extremely fast service food was out quick and fresh! Would most likely come back soon! Recommend this to anyone."
"5","My daughter and I had food delivered yesterday. O my goodness everything we ordered came hot and freshly prepared. My favorite was the Crab Puffs and the Sweet and Sour Chicken. My daughter loved her Fried Shrimp and Sweet and Sour Chicken. The portions were big enough that we shared with my 2 boys when they got home. I had the Combination Dinner, it was a lot of food. My daughter had Chicken, Rice, and Shrimp. Will definitely be ordering front them again. Also they were very friendly. Even answered questions we had about a different dish."
"4","As a girl who was raised in Arkansas, I do, from time to time, get a hankerin' for fried chicken. I didn't feel like going to the store, washing dishes, etc, so I headed to this KFC.\n\nKFC has changed a lot since I was a kid. It seems a lot cleaner. And I certainly don't recall not one, not two, but three cameras at the registers. But that's the world we live in, I guess. \n\nRegardless, this particular location is extremely clean, the employees seem to actually enjoy their jobs, and the food is made pretty quickly. In fact, last night, Vanessa actually special-ordered some chicken tenders to be made a la original recipe, instead of crispy, which is the only way listed on the menu. How nice!\n\nThe sides now come in reusable containers. So reuse them! There's no sense in putting more trash in our landfills if you can reuse them...for food, crafts, cannabis...whatever.\n\nSide note: in Cabot, Arkansas, KFC has a buffet. And a chicken liver meal. The buffet, I could do without, but I could dig some liver every once in awhile. Hint hint."
"4","I love Villa Deli and have been going for years.   I went for lunch today and they now sell Pizza and are under new ownership.  The sandwiches are still the best and of the highest quality.  The pizza was pretty good as well, I wish they would sell one slice but you have to buy two.  The one thing that is missing is the friendly service the old owners used to provide.  The service was not bad but there was no conversation or anything more than taking your order and thanking you while paying.  I think the charm of this place was how the old owner used to come out and talk to everyone and just made you feel good about being there.    Keep up the good work, but engage with your customers more and I promise they will keep coming back!   Good Luck"
"5","Great bagels! Not the best atmosphere but good coffee and bagels. Fair prices, friendly staff... I will definitely go there more often."
"2","Went on Saturday for lunch and the dining area was not to busy. Their was on server who managed all the tables. Since she was the only server the drink order took about 5 minuets after we arrived. My rating is based off of food quality. I ordered the Large New England Clam Chowder for 4.95, not badly priced, however I have had better canned chowder. very salty and WAY to much butter. Also the temperature for the soup was warm not hot, which probably means it was microwaved/ re-heated. We also ordered cheese sticks and calamari. They did look good when they cam out however, both dishes were under cooked and had to be sent back. Who wants soft calamari and cheese sticks? After the food was brought back to our table, the items still were not crsipy, whatever. the flavor of the breading on the calamari and cheese sticks was so bland and the marinara sauce was sub-par. Unfortunately i would not go back the Chowder house, rather go to Red Lobster!"
"1","Good if you like painfully slow service, frozen breaded seafood, and potato soup passed off as clam chowder.  This restaurant, while decorated in tacky, outdated marine decor, used to be really great.  Disappointed that the place I used to go for a taste of New England \""home\"", is now serving overpriced meals with a side of ridiculously slow service."
"3","I grew up on the coast in New England so I know my chowder and seafood.  Taylor's is a fun place to go for that New England seafood house experience in the Phoenix area.\n\nI always order a bowl of chowder which is just okay.  Creamy with plenty of clams and potatoes but has a strange flavor ingredient that I can't quite place which makes it taste just a bit off.  A small dollop of butter stirred in makes it taste more authentic.\n\nThis is one of very few places in the area where you can get fried scallops that come out tasting how they should and remind me of being back in Massachusetts.  Very large and fresh with a light batter and fried golden brown - delicious.\n\nI know this place has been around forever and it shows.  It really reflects a bit negatively when the decor in the restaurant is fun and authentic, but covered in dust and cobwebs.  The owner really just needs to shut down for a week and pull everything out and re-do it with the same theme but updated.  It would really really improve the experience!\n\nMy other reason besides the chowder and decor that garnered only 3 stars is the fact that they won't take AMEX cards.  I know many smaller places don't but it is really a pain when you are traveling and cannot use a corporate card to pay for meals and need to use either a personal card or cash to pay.\n\nIf the owners of Taylor's read this review and fix these things I guarantee they would begin getting 5 star ratings across the board!"
"4","I never write reviews for fast food, but this place was clean and the staff was pleasant.  The food, well it was Taco Bell would you expect anything different, it was good"
"4","Though not the cleanest Denny's I've been to, the service is really nice so I'll keep coming back. \n\nThe dirty that I'm referring to is in between the double-pane windows is soap film that makes it look like the windows are really dirty, but I know it really isn't on the inside of the restaurant."
"2","We came here for breakfast the other morning and got right in. The place looks like it might have been remodeled(?) when me and my husband went to sit in the booth our knees were smashed into each other that we could not sit across from each other. The food was not as good as it usually is, but that won't stop us from going back. We will just have to sit at a table. The waitress was really nice and service was fast."
"4","Are you sure this is a chain?\n\nThe staff is awesome the food is great. The prices are reasonable. \n\nSounds like a mom n pop type place to me. \n\nI still am a fan of the Pollo Fundito... wife tried the shredded beef one and it was good but not as good as the chicken."
"1","Zero stars. Do not stop there, do not order. Do not waste your time or money. Filthy dirty carpet  (what is the kitchen like?) The food is disgusting.  Red hot plates....ice cold enchiladas...no flavor. Disgusting place.  There is SO much good Mexican food in this area.....BUT NOT HERE!"
"3","Absolutely AVERAGE donuts; not terrible but nothing special. To be honest I'd give the QT a higher mark for donuts than Bosa."
"5","Best doughnuts in Chandler. Fresh doughnuts made throughout the day. Every drink under the sun besides coffee."

"4","I had the burger again this time. It was not greasy at all and had a nice flavor. I asked for some of the jalapeno cream cheese to try with it. That stuff it awesome. \n\nThe fries were thick but not steak fries. I liked them a lot. \n\nThe staff was really nice but a bit slow on the kitchen side. I however, did not mind as it was beautiful to sit out on the patio, wind blowing through my used be hair looking out over the desert. \n\nPrices are good, totally worth a drive to New River."
"1","Drive-up ordering box broken for months, today at lunch ordered a Double Del Cheeseburger but they had no meat to make burgers.  Need I say more! Off too Whataburger."
"3","So my coworkers and I had decided to try this place for lunch the other day, and their sandwiches were mediocre, their 5 layer brownies were good but a bit too sweet for all 4 of us that tried it.  I also had tried the cinnamon roll which was decent as well. Personally id rather just got to cinnabon for then drive all the way out there for theirs even though theirs is Huge.  I had also ordered the sugar cookie which i was expecting to taste like those cake sugar cookies with frosting was a normal sugar cookie but with frosting. So not my cup of tea but im sure plenty of others that need a good sugar rush would enjoy this immensely."
"2","I am a fan of taco stands in general, but....\nThis location consistently ruins my beloved bacon, potato, egg and cheese breakfast burrito.  Every now and then they get it just right, but most of the time there's something missing from it.  The bacon is frequently burned to a crisp, and the eggs...OH the poor eggs.  They are browned beyond all recognition and sometimes just a thin layer of bubbly burned stuff."
"2","We came here on a regular basis until they started wrapping our three rolled tacos with cheese and guacamole in paper rather than the little black boxes that always came in. Now the guac I get charged extra for, is all over the paper and not on my tacos. I'll go elsewhere moving forward."
"1","Worst McDonald's ever. They will make you wait in the \""Reserved Drive-Thru Parking\"" every time. What's the point of a Fast Food Drive-Thru when you have to pull over and wait afterward? This has always been an issue with THIS particular location. Supposedly, as legend has it, you are being made to wait in the reserved area so they can prepare 'fresh' food....as car after car after car behind you drive-thru and patrons receive their food with ease? Think about it this way...when was the last time you could remember noticing a special waiting area at the drive-thru at McDonald's? Exactly, they aren't built in to all the stores. The fact that this McDonald's has multiple drive-thru waiting areas should be a huge red flag to anyone in a hurry. Keep driving, there's a better McDonald's just a little further down the road on Alma School and Guadalupe."
"1","Well...take this for a grain of salt as seen through the eyes of a grown up and not a kid's...\nThis place saw it's prime about 20 years ago -- literally.  Every ride looks like it has been revived from the farthest reaches of the 1980's.  In fact, this park is better suited not as a fun place for kids, but as a setting for a movie where the penultimate chase happens in a long-forgotten and run-down amusement park.  I think there was a Liam Neeson movie that ended like this, actually...\n\nDon't bother with the all-day passes, as there are zero rides that the kids might want to ride more than once.  \n\nWe got there right at 10am on a Sat, and so there were no lines at all.  The whole ambiance kinda felt like what Michael Jackson's personal theme park might have looked like if he were galavanting about on his own.  I really can't imagine waiting in any sort of line for any of these rides.  They are all very disappointing, and, well, lame.  \n\nSo says my 5 yr old and 7 yr old.\n\nThe highlight was the soft pretzel from the snackstand.\n\nSave your money and don't bother coming here."
"4","This museum is located in downtown Mesa. Parking is right across the street which makes it very convenient! Parking is free which makes it even nicer :)\n\nAdmission is $10.00 per adult or should I say anyone 12 and over. I believe this is a fair price for a museum.\n\nHistory is bountiful within the walls of this museum. The levels of history encompass everyone regardless of age. The kids (young ones) seem to enjoy the large dinosaurs that surround the rooms. There are several \""hands on\"" areas for smaller children. \n\nTeens have a lot to read about rocks, fossils, and history. I am sure you could spend hours walking around reading every last word, it does seem a little redundant and a lot to read.\n\nOver all I think it's a nice museum, I just don't believe it is 5 Stars worth!"
"1","Not much to look at inside, the building is deceiving from the out side I thought there would be a lot more to look at. Walked and read the whole place in 30-45min"
"4","A great museum that my 1 year old can grow into.  There is a soft play area for the 4 and under crowd, but I've been disappointed when bigger kids have been in there taking toys and playing a little rougher than they should be around the little ones.\n\nIt's free for babies under 1, which is great because I don't think they could really get much out of it.  $7 is a reasonable enough price for the kids, but I wish they had a discounted rate for adults as we obviously don't get as much out of it as the kiddos do.  The good thing is that you can periodically find deals on sites like Google offers, so keep an eye out for those.  The basic membership is $60/year and pays the admission for 2 (must be immediate family members.)  That would pay for itself in just over 4 visits, so it's definitely something to consider.  There are also several other membership levels that grant admission to larger families and they seem to pay for themselves in even less visits."
"1","let me detail my last experience:\n\nI called network automotive on Main St. in mesa for a quote for replacing a part on my vehicle.  I had done my own diagnosis and was confident that the problem would be remedied with this procedure.  On this call they took down the information and said they would call me back with a quote.  They did return my call later that day and left a message saying to give them a call back.\n\nI called them back the next day and received a quote that seemed reasonable given the labor rate, and the price that I could find the part for.  I made an appointment for the next day at 8:00 am.  I was under them impression that the part was already ordered considering I was a return customer, and I had an appointment set. \n\nI arrived right at 8am to have the procedure done.  I handed my keys to the person at the desk and proceeded to wait.  What I saw happen next was that my truck was pulled into the back corner angled away from me, the hood put up, and not one person went near my vehicle for an hour and a half.  At around 9:30 I asked them if I should bring it back at a more convenient time.  They said they receieved the wrong part from the parts supplier.  I just looked at the person expecting him to tell me the correct part was on the way and he didn't; rather, he asked, and I quote, \""why do you want to replace that part?  I've never had to replace that part before.\""  I must remind you that on the first phone call I explained to them exactly what I wanted to have replaced and why.  At this time I explained to him exactly what I had already explained twice already, on the phone.  After I finish he tells me that he can only find the part I need for over 3.5 times the price that I could find it for from Autozone.  As this is all happening the tech has finally decided to pull out the old part, and he comes walking in to the desk area with it, and he says, \""yeah, it's bad.\""  This made me think that it took about 2 minutes to get the part out.\n\nAll in all, I ended up paying 90% MORE than what they originally quoted me, I paid 125% extra for the part, and paid for 1.5 hours of labor, for a 15 minute job.  I was there right at 8, and was able to roll out at 10:50.\n\nIn conclusion I will never take my vehicle back there.  My vehicle is over 10 years old and I maintain it very well, as it is an essential part of my livelyhood.  It's unfortunate that we cannot count on a local business such as this one to take care of the people from the town where they do business.\n\nI see a lot of people that give rave reviews over their alignments, and I'm sure they probably do a good job, but if you need parts, prepare to get GOUGED."
"5","it's apparent that this place use to be a bank, but after stepping inside you don't even notice you just stepped into a bank. it's like you just stepped inside a restaurant in italy. haha not really but the feeling takes over.\n\nthe service was great!! they were so nice and very knowledgeable. when i was there one of the servers dumped a whole tray of drink on to this customer's table. the customers were understandable about the whole situation. her co-workers helped her out and didn't leave her hangin', that's always nice....\n\nthe food was great!! it was VERY good!! i had the Veal with Lemon and Artichoke YUMMMMY!!! and my sister had the Cataloni that was heavenly good!\n\ni'll post pics later, but that place was really good. i would so go back there for dinner.\n\nWAY TO GO RIGATONY'S!!!!"
"2","Frankly, I was not impressed. I was asked \""links or patties' I chose links, I got patties.. I asked for eggs 'over easy', they were raw around the yolks even though the outside was cooked, looked like they were steamed or something... Bread / toast was below par and over buttered. Marmalade comes out in some kind of pot - why?\n\nSo, short version, I eat out a LOT in these kinds of places - and this is one where I won't be going back. Iowa Cafe just down the road blows it away."
"1","Do not waste your time or money living here. They will find a way to charge you when you move out. Jessica the property manager is awful. The gate, hot tub, and pool are never working. There is black widows and scorpions everywhere. The carpeting is gross and the apartments are dingy. Move down the road and don't waste your efforts even looking at this sad place."
"4","Pretty good and they deliver! The nachos are excellent and they put the cheese sauce in its own container and is more than enough for an extra side of chips. Most locations are cash only which can be a bummer"
"2","This restaurant was recommended to me.  I just wasn't that impressed.  Went for lunch on Sunday.  The place was empty except for one other couple that came in as we were getting ready to leave.  \n\nThe service was really bad.  We were ignored for about 5 minutes after coming in and sitting down.  Our drinks and food were all served promplty  but with no smile or friendliness.\n\nThe menu was a list of specials hanging all over the walls.  The only vegetarian option was Green Curry so I ordered that.  The soup came out first and had brown curly noodles in it as well as chunks of small brown pieces of chicken.  Two of my kids liked it but I couldn't try it.  Lunch was served with fried rice instead of white or brown and I wasn't a fan of that.  The egg roll also had meat so I couldn't try that.\n\nMy girls shared the chicken teriyaki and were not impressed.  The fried pieces of wonton were the most popular part of the meal.  My son had the red beef curry and enjoyed it.  So did my husband.\n\nI won't be back."
"2","Thought I'd give this place a try since it was near work and I love Thai Curry.  It was eh.  First, the soup was really bad, brown rotini noodles, brown broth, very unappetizing.  I ordered the beef curry lunch special.  Not much beef a TON of bamboo shoots, some sauce and fried rice.  The sauce was ok.  \nNext time I'm looking for Thai Curry near work, I'll search for somewhere else."
"3","So I went here the other day with a friend for lunch. The food was.... strange. I don't know if this place makes Thai food from a different region than most others or what, but the menu was not what I expected and the food was not what I expected. The place had some 'Chinese' lunch specials.... which is weird in itself, and the main menu had thai food I guess. I ordered the chicken with pan fried noodles.... expecting like a crispy noodle. Not the case. I don't know why they call these pan fried noodles... they're just kind of greasy wide rice noodles that are like Chow Fun or something.... not at all what I expected. Also, what I found really strange, was that a) they don't have you choose a spice level, so the food isn't spicy at all and b) the food had green onions and cilantro and that's it as far as vegetables go. Every Thai place i have ever been to uses lots of fresh vegetables, which is why it generally is better than Chinese food. The noodles were fine, they had a decent taste, but I wouldn't want to go get them again. My friend really likes the curry here, so maybe that's good and I should try it next time.... but honestly I didn't think this place was so great.... Also, it was pricier than any other Thai food place I've been to, with most entrees costing around 10$."

"2","To your left you'll see a rock that looks like a dinosaur and to your right you'll see a rock that looks like a person.  Sometimes you'll see some real animals, but not today...  \n\nReally? Is that all you've got.  Maybe we just didn't luck out, but our tour guide was horrible.  Not witty, not funny, not even that interesting.  He was clearly reading from a script because at one point he lost his place or got confused or something and ended up re-reciting the entire opening three minutes, word for word.  Most of the time he just but on a soundtrack, which clearly was way too short for the entire 90 minute tour since we listened to the Titanic song 4 times.  As a side note, you may not want to remind people of a huge boat accident when we're doing a boat tour... but that's just me.  \n\nDefinitely something for the older crowd, but even they seemed restless after about 45 minutes."
"4","The Dolly Steamboat tour makes for a nice family outing.  One of the other posters mentioned a concern over the winding roads to get here but I think the scenery and one lane bridges along the way is half the fun. Just keep your eyes on the road, take it easy and watch for other drivers. I always take family and friends from out of town out this way for the beautiful scenery but hadn't tried the Dolly Steamboat tour.  Glad we did it.  My girlfriend and I took my sister and her family on the 4:00pm tour, which I think was probably the best time to go.  The 12:00pm (noon) tour would've been hot and I think perhaps the sun might have been in our eyes and reflecting off of the lake the entire time, so I was happy with the late afternoon tour we chose. Everyone in our party really enjoyed the tour.  Our guide was very nice and very funny but didn't overdo it.  He explained the history of the canyon and its natural features as well as the wildlife as we made our way around the lake.  We saw a bunch of Bighorn sheep along the rim of the canyon and a Bald Eagle soaring back and forth across the lake.  I've been on other steamboat tours and in my opinion this one seemed very family oriented and less about beer / drinks, which is what we were hoping for as my two young nieces were the primary reason for our Canyon Lake excursion.  Party boats are always fun but this felt like a family boat and although I don't know what the Dolly nighttime tour is like, the afternoon tour was perfect for a family."

"5","Faith Works Automotive does good business.  I have a 2004 Toyota Matrix with 152k miles.  I called at 2:30 pm, made it into the place by 3 pm, had them inspect all my brakes, was told that I only needed to replace the back ones, and that even though my tires were cracking that I could still get another 1-2k miles out of them.  The cracks were more due to the kind of rubber composite the tires were made of.  And I had an oil change and was out the door by 4:30 pm.  Fast, honest, and fair.  I think I've found my new mechanic."
"2","I'm gonna have to lay down a star reduction for this place, unfortunately.\n\nHad breakfast there Sunday 2-20-11.  With tip, came to $11.\n\nWent with the protein punch, the \""Carne Asada Platter\"" with two fried eggs.\n\nI was hoping for some \""seasoned\"" carne asada, which most places give you these days.\n\nThis was just a short, skinny section of over-cooked flank steak.  VERY tough.  Hard to cut with a sharp knife and hard to chew up.\n\nEggs and re-fried beans were nothing special.  Beans basically tasteless.\n\nThe one semi-bright spot was the salsa served with chips before the food came out.  It was good.  Not excellent, not VERY good, just....Good.\n\nI'm gonna have to say this place is hovering between \""slightly below average\"" and \""average.\""\n\nWon't be going back."
"4","I pulled up to the store, and my wife (disgustedly) asked \""Are you sure this is it.\"" I told her to be patient and have an open mind.\n\nAfter entering the store part, I was pretty impressed. They had probably one of the largest beer selections I'd seen. And their website stated that if they didn't have it, they could probably get it for you. Nice!\n\nThen, we went downstairs to the wine bar. That sold us right there. Cozy, friendly, good selection... I want to go back. Soon!"
"5","Oh wow! This place is a surprisingly unexpected treat!! One of my besties and I went here last night to meet up with some of his coworkers. We didn't really know what to expect, so we dug our heels in for a night of randomness...and they did not disappoint! The outside just looks like a regular liquor store, if you drove past it you wouldn't even notice it. But once you walk through the doors, the alcohol heavens open up and little drunken angels start singing 'If you want it, we got it! la la la la la!!!' I was amazed at the selection and had barely been there 30 seconds when I noticed the sign directing us downstairs to the cellar and pub area...and even more choices!!! Every microbrew, macrobrew, and everything in between that you have ever (or never) heard of is down there. We opted for the $5 wine tasting to start...and didn't regret a second of it! There were (I think) 6 types ranging from riesling to shiraz. Each one better than the last. Then we purchased several other bottles of delicious wines, including a very strange cabernet sauvignon named 'Giani'. It is a chillable red wine that is EXTREEEEEEEEEEEMELY sweet. Not in the way that people say 'Oh this red wine isn't as dry as this other one' NO! It was actually sweeter than grandma's coffee. So if you are someone who thinks you don't like red wine because it's not sweet, try this stuff, it will make you a believer."
"5","Stopped here even though I'm way against anything to do with \""Sun Devils\"".lol.  \n\nGreat beer selection of super hard to find brews. Even better wine selection downstairs and a laid back lounge. We stopped by and the wife had a glass of wine and I had a pint of Beer Republic beer. Great bartender downstairs with knowledge of beer and wine. I would totally come here to shop and have a drink downstairs in the lounge."
"5","So you will stop when the GPS tells you to, and you will instantly double check the address. You will question yourself, because this just CANNOT be it. You expect a wine cellar and what you have is this dinky liquor store. You enter the dinky liquor store and it couldn't be more anonymous, but if you just stay true (Navy term I believe) there is a staircase that leads down. Normally this is a bad sign, never go downstairs in a dinky liquor store - this one is the exception. I find the experience to be a little Narnia-like. But it isn't Narnia; it's a really cool looking wine bar. \n\nAnd this would be cool if this was it - but wait, there's more.\n\nThere is also a lounge area where people can relax and hang out and the rumor says that they play live music down here. I have totally missed it every time, but I cannot blame the establishment for my failure to plan. \n\nThey have a nice wine selection, and a limited but eclectic beer selection.\n\nI have not been here for the live music, so I cannot say much about the clientele.. but the establishment is really nice. First I was put off by the way I came here (through the dinky liquor store) but now I feel that belongs in a speakeasy kind of way."
"1","Cranky old man who has been in the business too long. If his work product was great perhaps it would be worth it but his results are hit and miss. I would not recommend going to this man."
"2","I have been a loyal customer since 1999. Makes me sad to right a bad review but since high schools closed their campuses Steves place has deteriorated tremendously. I went in as usual for lunch ordered my sub and returned to work with the wrong sandwich. I ate it upset but so hungry after picking off the dreadful items. I called spoke with a nice man who said come in I will write ur name down. I did and 4 people playing around in the back told me I need to speak with owner which I said no problem and their response was he is out of town. They all thought it was funny and I was so upset. If Steve's crazy sub ever goes out of business it will be because of the horrible customer service from his teenage and one grown man who seem to not care if customers ever comeback. Steve please read this and several others I have read that your staff needs to go. I hope someday I will be treated as a customer and maybe even get the sub I paid for."
"3","do not fear this yellow and red striped hut, right here in Mesa's hood :)\nRolberto's has some pretty good stuff going for it.. their Carnitas is more traditional, and flavorful, than similar establishments.. their pico, and guacamole are really awesome, totally homemade.. (tasting, at least).. \nIt's not the BEST taco stand in town, but it does the trick, especially if you live nearby.  This is a walk up, cash-only, 24 hour, outdoor seating, or drive thru kinda place.."
"4","Great Chili Cheese fries and plenty of sports channels to pick from. Impressive shot menu as well. We'll definitely be back!!!"
"1","There were COCKROACHES crawling ON the bar top. Multiple. And many other bugs as well. We decided to just chug our cheap beers and get the heck out of there, but service was very slow AND when we got our check, we had been charged 3$ for drinks that were posted as being $2.50 not only in the menu, but on two other signs in the restaurant. I don't know why I would have to tell a bartender how much their drinks cost, and \""Trixxxxeee\"" was one of the worst bartenders I've ever been served by. I wish I could give this place no stars."
"3","The food is good and the prices are cheap. Just make sure you check your bag before you leave the store or the drive thru. I go here all the time and about half of the time they don't give me everything I ordered. \n\nThey're normally happy to get you everything once you point it out to them though. If you order one combo meal and don't ask for anything special like no ice in your drink or no pickles on your burger or an extra hash brown you'll probably get everything. But ordering it your way most likely will lead to it being done the wrong way until you ask to have it fixed. \n\nThe 2 tacos for a buck is always good and they always have a promo menu item that is normally very good as well."
"2","About 2 days after I posted my initial review on here, I got a call from this hospital.  They wanted to explain why I ended up with the charges for the IV when I had told them not to do anything until after the consult with the doctor.  I felt a bit like I was in some kind of country where I didn't have free speech rights, so I hung up.  The hospital should have thought about the charges they were charging me for AT THE TIME I SHOWED UP WITH A CRISIS rather than taking advantage of my emotional state.  And I'd like to revise my estimate of the doctor's knowledge.  I showed up with a cat I suspected had been poisoned with antifreeze.  The doctor told me that was unlikely because according to her antifreeze does cats in so quickly they won't be alive for  couple days like mine was.  She was wrong, as I had the kidney tested at a vet diagnostic lab.  Just be CAREFUL who you go to and who you pay a lot of money to.  Do your own research.\n\n9/27/13:  Someone thought this review was \""funny\"" ?!?!?!  What kind of nut thinks this is \""funny\""?"
"2","We brought home a puppy from the shelter 8 days ago with a respiratory infection. She was on medication for a few days, and then in less than two days' time, she got very worse. \n\nWe rushed Milly to this location at 3AM last night. She was in a lot of pain and had the hardest time breathing. The staff members were friendly for the most part and pretty knowledgeable. They wanted to hospitalize Milly for a few days to run some tests on anemia, tick diseases, and other various long-term potential health issues. We were quoted that the treatment plan may range from about $4-5,000. We don't have that kind of money. We decided that these tests could wait until the morning - we just wanted to get her breathing normal, and if she had anemia or something long-term that our day vet could help us for a fraction of the price in the morning. We accepted some antibiotics and a fluid injection, because a few hundred dollars was the most we could spend at the time. They kindly gave us some recommendations for at-home remedies as well.\n\nMilly passed away later in the night. We took care of her most of the night to the best of our abilities. Even if we had known that she would pass away so soon, there was no way that we could have afforded to have her hospitalized. I just wish that we could have done something to help her immediately, instead of spending thousands on the unknown."
"2","Outrageously priced. I get they have state of the art equipment but we couldn't afford to use any of it. While the staff is super friendly we did have one of the doctors say, after we couldn't pay to have anymore tests done, that it wouldn't be bad if we choose to put our dog down. I have no idea how a person can be so cold. Do no harm, right? Our dog only stayed 24 hours at the place and it ran us around $2000. We took our dog somewhere else that was much more affordable and they saved his life. He stayed at the other place for about a week. Same treatment and it cost us less than the one day at VCA."
"1","The only factor that made this place ever worth mentioning in a posiitive manner it's the Mgr. Alex. He treats people with nothing but respect. He does what he has to yet leaves me with more dignity than any type of subcontracted company that is yet anotehr tool of the system. I was there when he prevented a guy from physically attacking one of the other employees without any force. He knows how to handle himself professionally while respecting the community."
"2","It's old and smells off!  Always have to wait in long lines to check out AND NO SELF CHECK OUT!  Never been impressed with Basha but this is one of their low end stores."
"1","We had a negative experience at Camping World regarding our potential RV purchase on April 10, 2013.\n\nThe Camping World we visited was in Mesa, Arizona (2222 E Main st., Mesa, AZ).\nWe were working with sales person RYAN. (Young Caucasian with furr on his teeth)\n\nRYAN found a used RV that came in on trade that he thought we may be interested in. Camping World hadn't gotten the unit yet, but we were told we could view the used RV soon. To have Camping World's salesman hold the unit for us- he recommended we put a refundable hold deposit of $1000 down, and Ryan (The furry toothed salesman) assured us the deposit was refundable. We also hadn't actually looked at the RV yet, but thought the RV could be a potentially great unit to buy- so we left the $1000 refundable sight unseen deposit.\n\nFor personal reasons, we elected to continue our RV search and asked to get our refundable deposit returned.\n\nObtaining our refundable deposit did not go so smoothly!  I went to Camping World to thank Furry Toothed RYAN for his time, but we decided to take our REFUNDABLE $1000 DEPOSIT back and continue our RV search. This is when RYAN collaborated with his unprofessional Money Hungry Sales Manager to notify him that I was there to get back our deposit and release the hold on the RV we hadn't seen and continue our RV search. This is where these bogus money hungry salesmen began to RAZZ me, a Female Client. Rudely interrogating me with comments like \""Why do you want your deposit back... We've spent a lot of time locating this RV for you\""... Then proceeded to laugh at me like a load of overweight hyenas when I stated that we are simply going to continue our search for the perfect RV for our family and that we would like our refundable deposit back.  I am embarrassed with Camping World, and the Mesa, Arizona Camping World Team should be ashamed of themselves.\n\nI followed up with our furry toothed salesman RYAN via email to share our camping world experience.\n\nI'd like to add that RYAN proclaimed to my hubby (over the phone on April 16, 2013) that him and the sales team were rude to me and interrogated me because they were frustrated on their end because they spent a lot of time locating RV's for us to look at. (Um hey dirtbags, we were shopping for the perfect RV for us, we weren't in the market to just buy something y'all \""worked so hard to find\""... Get a real job lazy schmucks, locating an RV on a computer isn't rocket science.)\n\nI'd like to respond to RYAN by saying that his frustrations are very trivial compared to what we have to manage on a daily basis. I'd also like to explain to RYAN and the Mesa, AZ Camping World Sales Team that asking for our refundable deposit, whatever the reason, doesn't call for disrespect and interrogation of a female client.\n\nWe were looking to purchase a new fifth wheel RV, and were not desperate to just buy anything. We have a very unique living situation, and we were preparing to spend 10's of thousands of dollars on a new RV- and when making this decision, we weren't going to make a purchase until we found the fifth wheel of our liking. A fifth wheel that we love, 100%.\n\nAfter putting down a refundable depoit on a used fifth wheel that we hadn't actually looked at- we decided to continue on with our search for a new fifth wheel.\n\nCamping World's Sales Team in Mesa, Arizona were so desperate to make a sale, that they literally disrespected and interrogated me when I told them we elected to take our refundable deposit back- and continue our search for the perfect RV for our family.\n\nThis is unacceptable, and I certainly do not appreciate my experience with Camping World.\n\nI'd strongly advise buyers to be aware of this when choosing to Shop for RV's at the Mesa, AZ Camping World."

"5","The best RV park love outside the pool area Harold the Owner is the best part of the whole park who cares about amenities when you have this guy at the Helm you can go anyplace. In life we meet unforgettable Landmarks and this Man Harold is class act all the way."
"3","I'm not as enthusiastic as the other two reviews, but this is above average in terms of food.  However, the atmosphere is lacking in comparision.  It really is a hole-in-the-wall.  If you want something different than a chain, you may want to consider it."
"2","It's shameful how \""downhill\"" this place has gone.  I used to be a huge fan when the Sirrine's owned it.  I'll stick to Rancho de Tia Rosa (which IS owned by the Sirrine's) next time.  \n\nThe service was PAINFULLY slow.   Now, I could understand that years ago when I used to go and it took 45 minutes to an hour just to get a table.  But when only 4 or 5 tables are filled there's NO EXCUSE for poor service.  \n\nThe salsas used to be SO MUCH BETTER and more flavorful.  They are a hint of their former selves.  The salsa verde - previously a stand-out in the green salsa category - is mediocre at best... and that's a tremendous compliment.  Oddly enough -the chips are still some of the best I've ever, ever, ever had.  \n\nThe food - like the salsas - is a shadow of its former self.  It lacks the succulence, the flavor, and the wow-factor it had when Dennis Sirrine was calling the shots.  It's bland, slightly dry and just not there anymore.  What was equally disappointing is they've replaced their iced tea (something used to drive across town for) to a horrible concentrate.  Blech.  \n\nConsidering this place used to be packed to the gills on a Tuesday afternoon at 2pm and now you can easily walk in on Friday at dinner time and have your pick of tables, the restaurant needs to recognize the issue and DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.  They absolutely cannot go on like this."
"2","No restaurant review should ever have to say, \""Where you start getting into trouble with this place is when the entrees come out.\"" But that's exactly the case here. This food is hot garbage wrapped in tortillas. The fish tacos are nauseating. The incredibly dry meat in the green chilli burrito gave my brother in law food poisoning. The beans taste burnt, and they've apparently decided to season their rice with dust. Failing at the basic, I can only imagine the nightmares happening on the deeper items on the menu. Also it's overpriced. The chips and salsa are very good (especially the green salsa), and the staff is very friendly. Those things are important enough to squeeze out two stars. But if you're near downtown Mesa, I don't know why you wouldn't go to Mango's instead."
"5","Trim Time is in a tiny little strip mall, right next to the beautiful Wright house on University in Mesa.  The girl's up front are very nice.  They have about twenty cages in a separate room to the side for dog drop offs.  The sink area in the rear seems nice, all of the dogs were quiet and seemed happy.  I only had my dog's nails and expression done.  Ten bucks a piece, nice that they do ala carte. \n\nThey gave my girl a christmas collar too!  Very nice and clean."
"1","Customer service was bad enough that I feel compelled to write a review which I have never done before. The plumber came out and repaired the problem but left our water shut off at the house valve, no big deal really, but when we called in to see why we had no water and the repair was completed (even though the plumber never notified us he was here), and wanted to see if the plumber was on his way back and the receptionist was extremely rude. She told us that the plumber had left the water off because that was how he found it. Mind you both my roommate and I are off today, have used the water today and neither of us knew where the valve was or we would have turned it back on. This is where super receptionist comes in and tells me \""what do you think my guy is a liar?\"" multiple time to which I finally responded \""yes, yes I do!\"" It was a very simple fix, once she told me where the valve was I flipped on the water and life went on, but beware, if their guy messes up at all you will get defense secretary of the year on the other end of the phone."
"5","Used a Groupon to get some video cassettes converted to DVD.  A couple days after dropping off the tapes, I realized that a video had fallen between the seats of my car.  I was too lazy to ask if it could be added to my group of video cassettes.  A few weeks later I got the call to pick up my DVDs.  I asked about the additional cassette, and was told that they would just do it right away at the Groupon price.  Twenty minutes later I had all of my video cassettes DVDs in hand.  Overall, I would say that worked out well."
"3","I enjoyed the food, I got the chicken fried steak and it came with mashed potatoes and the gravy that comes on the steak. Also some green beans and a side salad that comes out first. All in all the food was good. \n\nComing in was confusing. We weren't greeted and since it was our first time there we were very confused. Because it's a cozy place I'm ok with there not being a hostess stand. But I do feel like someone should be on top of greeting the guests so that we know how the waiting works (you just walk in and stand awkwardly at the door and they ask who was there first when they have a table ready.)\n\nAll in all it's so so. But I do love that it's a famiky business and the food was good"
"2","I had originally posted a 5-star review, but have now retracted it. While at The Brake Shop to have my brakes inspected, I also asked for an oil change and tire rotation. After they drained the oil, they realized they didnt have the proper oil filter, and could not locate one. They added some oil back in my 2012 Audi, and replaced the oil filter.\n\nWhen I went to Jiffy Lube the next day, the service guy there wouldn't touch it - there was oil all over the engine. I had to immediately go to the nearest Audi dealership, where they stated that either the oil filter was replaced improperly, or an incorrect oil filter was used. Had I driven any longer, this could have cause severe damage to my 1 yr old Audi.\n\n2 Stars because the store manager was very friendly, and didn't try to upsell me anything. Negative 3 stars for the poor garage staff."
"1","Saratoga was a horrible place to live. The rent is cheap and you really get what you pay for.  I was in constant fear that my apartment was going to get broken into. I would sometimes have to take my dog out at night and the complex is scary at night. Saratoga has a night security guard but its one dorky guy on a bicycle, this did not at all make me feel safer.  Several of my neighbors had a few incidents with bed bugs and roaches. The staff wasn't the best and the head office lady was really harsh on people she disliked. If your looking to rent in the Mesa/Tempe area I recommend you avoid Saratoga apartments. Spend the extra money to get a safer, cleaner, nicer apartment with a staff that is more professional."
"5","Salt River Tubing runs its operation like a well-oiled machine, with frequent shuttles at the pick up points with drivers who know what they're doing and are happy to help you out.  SRT works hard to keep the environmental impact of recreational tubing under control, running staff through the river regularly servicing SRT-provided waste receptacles and equipping tubers with plastic bags designated for trash collection.\n\nThe availability of restroom facilities, even pit toilet park-standard facilities, regularly along the route does wonders for making this activity civilized.\n\nFun and well worth the thirteen bucks for a day rental of tube and shuttle service."
"4","This is great! I've never had so much fun! We rented tubes and made sure to bring sheets to cover the tubes (so you don't burn because they are black) or bring your own light colored tubes). We also brought coolers with food and drinks (you can bring beer, too I think). There were a few rapids where we went down really fast which was great! People throw marshmallows. I got a great tan, make sure to get spray on sunscreen. There is 1 restroom down the river. I'd recommend avoiding spring break because college students will flash (men & women)."
"2","Tubing down the Salt River was an experience comparable to floating down the River Styx (from Greek Stux, also meaning \""hate\"" and \""detestation\""). I feel like I not only circled the underworld nine times but got sucked into it, and the ferryman Charon was a beer-bong wielding asshole.\n\nMy best girlfriend & I got there when it opened at 9 and the first part of our tubing experience was very pleasant, but now I know it's only because at that point it was still too early for everyone else to have gotten sufficiently plastered. We had our cooler tied between our two tubes and yes, we had a few beers too, but we were just looking to have a nice chill float down the river. We met some cool people along the way, hung out for a bit before we'd drift on down our way. A couple hours into it we stopped off at the side of the river, and a group of twentysomethings, mostly guys and a few girls, had banked as well, and asked if we wanted jello shots. So we figured yeah, cool, & hung out and drank with them for a bit. But it turns out they're the type of people who feel like if they give you a bit of alcohol, you owe them your freakin' life. At this point what I figure happened is, these guys were looking to get laid, & when me and my girl went to bail, they flipped out. I was supposed to catch a late afternoon flight back to San Diego, and she was supposed to go to work after dropping me off at the airport, and these assholes f*cked everything up. They dumped our little tube with a tub on it which held all of our stuff- cooler, shorts, sandals, towels, sunblock, water, everything. And somehow sent our other tubes cascading down the river; my girl managed to somehow retrieve her car key by some miracle at least. By then I had gotten out of the water, she swam back and joined me, and one of the guys got in her face talking sh*t and looking like he was about to hit her, which pissed both of us off so we started going off on them. Then they called some sort of gang code that somebody else recognized, to which they informed me and my girl we were f*cking with the Hells Angels and we best step back. At this point one of the guys' girls still floating in the river starts yelling at me, to which I simply yell \""SHUT UP,\"" and she did. Smart move, because I was livid. \n\nAnyway they didn't seem like any Hells Angels to me, just some wannabe thugs who'd been drinking all day, but they were Hell's something because they sure ruined our day on the River Styx. So now me and her go to one of the firemen guys standing around at the side of the river, and ask if they can help, and they say they can't do anything unless we're drowning. Oh great, we can nearly get beat down by these punks but unless we're drowning, we're SOL? They gave me this bullshit little compass thing, but I didn't need help finding my direction, I needed help finding my hope in the general decency of humanity, which had been swept down the river along with all of my belongings. No compass was going to help me find that.\n\nAwhile later we encounter this group of hippies on a big raft, who graciously scoop us up and ferry us to our pickup point down the river, and these people were so kind and amazing compared to the drunks surrounding us, plus the guy steering the thing looks like he could be Jesus. They helped redeem a bit of my faith in the world, especially when one of them gave me their oversized flip flops as mine had been lost and my feet were already badly cut up.\n\nSo in retrospect, was it an unforgettable experience? Definitely. Would I want to repeat it again? Definitely not. \n\nNow I know what spring break in Hell is like."
"4","I had to write a review about this place after my group was torn about going after reading some reviews about how dirty this place made them feel and how they were tore up from rocks. So we envisioned way dirty water that was a trickle at places with rocks in too shallow water where we would have to go done in single file. We were ready for the worst but it's really not that bad. \n\nIt was never less than 10 yards or so wide. Yes, people do loose their trash like beer cans but it's not as trash filled as other places like the beach or the park. They do throw giant marshmallows so you will encounter mushiness. And people are peeing in the river, (are you surprised?) but it's moving water, so it's like nature's toilet anyway (like the ocean). And most everyone is drunk but I know there is a lot more stupid going on in any bar on any sat or Fri night. So, basically, if you are prissy about being things being dirty, and are one of those people that can't have a little fun with other drunk people and look down on them for doing stupid things, you will not have a good time. FYI, you will also not have any fun in places like NYC or most dive bars which you will think is dirty. Most of the people are just lazing down the river with their friends. \n\nI would like to give some tips and warning: Bring water, rope to tie your rafts together, water shoes, spray on sun block, food/snacks and a DD. I have never EVER seen so many cops out on my 20 mile drive back to our place in my life. There were check points, and 3 cop cars pulling over 1 car, and people with their hands hand cuffed behind their backs. It's serious guys, don't mess with it.  Also, you will not notice how drunk you are until you stand up, so be careful not to drown."
"2","I got in my car to leave for my job as a teacher and got the dreaded battery click of death. I called AAA, who sent a van in a prompt manner, but not soon enough for me to get to school on time, so I had to call in a substitute. \nThe van driver seemed very professional, and offered to replace the battery, install it, and dispose of the old one. The fees he quoted just kept adding up and up. I'm not certain how high they might have gone because I let him know I thought over 130.00 for a battery was excessive especially when I am a Premiere member. \nI phoned the Honda dealership, who quoted me a price of under 90.00 for a 3-year battery, installed. I had the car started, and drove directly to Tempe Honda for a new battery and full-car check-up. The charge was under $90. And kept $40 in my pocket.\n\nA word to the wise--know your prices before buying a battery from AAA!!!"
"2","My boyfriend and I ate here because we had a giftcard, and thank goodness we did, I would never of paid for the food otherwise. Our appetizer was a greasy mess and our entrees were small and disappointing. The service was alright but the place seemed dirty. Even though this place is conveniently located near my house, I'm not returning."
"5","one word:  awesome!"
"4","Changing my 3 starts to 4.\n\nThe produce quality has been pretty good lately. I was excited for the strawberry sale this last week (4 for $5) and although the strawberries could have been more ripe, this wasn't the fault of sprouts.\n\nThe meat dept always has good prices. You can find \""manager's special\"" sausage in the pre-pack case for $1.99/lb. Needless to say, I trust the meat here, so that in itself is is worthy of 5 stars...but this isn't just a butcher shop.\n\nGREAT prices on beer if you buy what's on sale. San Tan 6-packs for $6.99?! YES!!! In the last 4 or 5 weeks, it's been this price twice."
"3","Not terrible, not great. May be better to call ahead.....we ended up waiting a while and then they had 3 workers working on 6 people. They were doing their best but understaffed and too many customers. Their service probably also suffered a little bit because of it. Might not have been a good day for them..."
"2","Tortillas are always stale. Pizza is always either raw or burnt. On several occasions i have found that the staff had placed a new time label over another to avoid cooking fresh pizzas. \nThe quality of the food at this location just always seems to be sub par. I have lived near this location for ten+  years and its always been the same. So i go to the brown and mesa dr location"
"1","My husband and son have had their hair cut here for years, but no more.  The cuts have been fine, but their business practices leave much to be desired.  They constantly change their marketing/incentive programs, and refuse to honor what they had in place before.  Last year they advertised in both the Mountain View Football and Wrestling fundraiser cards, and then refused to honor the terms that were on the cards.  \""We're sorry, it should've stated this _________.\""  Today, I went to offer a punch card that already had 5 punches on it (need 6 for a free cut), only to be told they don't use them anymore, and they wouldn't honor it.  So, we paid for 6 haircuts with the promise of a free one in return, and now.... nothing.  I asked for the owner's contact info, which they wouldn't give me.  They took my name and number instead and promised to get back to me.  We'll see if that happens, but I'm not holding my breath.  \n\nMy husband starting going elsewhere about 4 or 5 months ago, but I continued taking my son here purely out of convenience.   No longer, though.  I'm tired of the bait and switch."
"5","Hands down, my favorite location.  I have been coming here for years.  The staff is one of the friendliest in the biz.  I rarely have had an issue, but whenever I have, the staff have gone above and beyond to resolve and/or compensate for the error.  I also appreciate the fact that they make an effort to remember the names of regular guests, no matter how infrequent.  I'm thinking THIS Arby's!"
"4","One of my preferred pizza places."
"5","I been coming here since I was a kid and I love it!\nI could never get sick of this pizza.\nSomething magical about the sauce they use, and the crust is very original.\n\nI now live in California and I rarely get a chance to enjoy Barros.  I have yet to find a pizza place in California that compares.\n\nBarros come to Southern California please!!!!"
"5","Barro's is always awesome. When I call in an order its usually ready faster than they say it will be, and their meatball pizza is delicious."
"2","Good energy in this space, but too bad about how expensive all of the classes and services are. There is a decent amount of cd's, books, and candles, but not much else. I saw a few books I have sold myself, and was shocked at the mark up. Not to mention the prices to attend a group reading or other event they had scheduled...I felt like I was being pressured to get a reading when I started asking about different psychics, etc... My friend and I didn't really feel too comfortable after that, so we left and have never been back since. I understand trying to run a business to make money, but don't shove your services down people's throats."
"2","I could just copy & paste Tim J's review of this place (from a year & a half ago!), & it would be real close, but let me do my own, \""Good/Not So Good\"" account:\n\nThe good:\n\n*  It's nice inside, & I was able to plant myself in a comfortable booth for lunch.  Norm R. joined me, to run this place up against one of the Valley's best of these kinds of places, \""Pizza Buffet & Much, Much More\"" in North Phoenix.  I also kept Pizza Hut Buffet (48th St.), Amazing Jake's, CiCi's, Pep\u00e9's & Peter Piper in mind, in reviewing it.\n\n*  The salad bar is ok, having enough of the usual veggies to satisfy, & there were potato & macaroni salads that were ok.\n\n*  Disregarding grease, the flavor of the pizza was pretty good.\n\n*  Our server, an older lady who looked like she'd be more at home at (the great) Scott's Generations, was friendly & attentive.\n\nOk, let's get to the dirt:\n\n*  They have \""Rules.\""  Have you ever been to New Town Super Buffet in Burbank, CA?  \""$20.99 extra charge if you eat the fish off the sushi & don't eat all the rice.\""  \""$20.99 extra charge if you don't eat all the food on your plate.\""  \""$20.99 extra charge if you take a plate of any one thing.\""  Ok, it wasn't quite as bad as THAT, but it was, in so many words, NO YOU CAN'T COME OVER TO THIS SIDE OF THE SERVING TABLE WHERE IT'S MORE CONVENIENT TO GET YOUR PIZZA THAT'S IN THE BACK!  NO, YOU CAN'T GET YOUR OWN ICE CREAM CONE FOR DESSERT!  You get the idea.\n\nThen there was the pizza.  There was some cheese bread, some garlic bread, & several pizzas out.  The pizza choices consisted of cheese, cheese with a dab of something else, pepperoni, sausage, & pepperoni & sausage.  Nothing else, really, except that you could special order \""taco pizza\"" or, can you imagine?, SAUERKRAUT pizza!  HOLY S#*@T, & you thought Spam Lo Mein was weird!\n\nThere was so much grease floating around on the top of the pizza slices that you could roll one up from side to side, aim it at your friend (in this case Norm R.), & squirt it out the bottom at them like milking a cow!\n\n*  The coup de gr\u00e2ce to this place was the outrageous price!  I called ahead, & they told me $8.50 including soft drink & a soft-serve cone, which is ridiculous for a pizza buffet.  Then, when I arrived here, hungry & 21 miles from home, I was advised that they have just jacked the price up to $9.25 for all adults!  HOLY S#*@T AGAIN!  Even if the pizza WASN'T all greasy, the maximum price, including drink & no-you-can't-get-it-yourself soft serve ice cream cone, should be $6.25.  Even then, it wouldn't be as good overall as Pizza Buffet, where the same amount of choice costs $4.99/$3.99 Senior!\n\nTwo Stars, period."
"2","My wife and I stopped here for a quick bite while we were in Mesa just for the night.  I ordered the fish tacos and a Birria taco.  My wife ordered the green chili pork burrito.  None of them tasted that good...compared to many similar taco joints I've been to in the past.  The fish tacos for instance simply had way too much stuff on top which made it difficult to eat.  Sorry this was a miss for us however I do give them at least 2 stars for packaging everything so nicely on our to-go order."
"1","Dropped in to Quality bumper a dealership recommendation for some running boards. Running boards were great. The salesman was very insistent that I buy this truck bed cover, said I was not interested. Kept on said he would give me a great deal. So eventually I cracked...lol I paid for the boards and cover. Then he told me the cover was not in stock and they would have to order it. I stated, I just want to cancel then again very high pressure to keep it, did not want to give my money back. Stated they would call when it was in, probably Friday. With hesitation I agreed. Friday came, saturday went by no word. When I called Monday they stated they called and I would not answer. I checked my phone no recorded of them calling. The manager stated they called and it was my fault since I did not answer. Being told I was lying to them they stated that now I would have to pay a re-stocking fee and the installation was no longer free. Really? Worst customer service I have ever had. WOULD NOT RECOMEND to even my worst enemy:) Buyer beware when shopping here."
"3","Just wanted to update. Manager contacted us. Was willing to give full refund or have the top installed for free. Seems there was a communication issue. Issue was resolved, even kept the truck box cover. Did have an issue, but company did resolve in a timely manner and apologized for the miscommunication"
"2","Beware of Stress-O-Pedic mattresses!  Furniture Plus has great prices on mattresses...or so I thought.  2 years ago I bought a queen SOP Posture Correct mattress because it was so comfortable in the store.  They delivered it and set it up...wonderful.  One problem.  This thing had such a strong odor I had to take it outside and let it air out for almost a year!  Stress O Pedic uses poly urethane foam which has some horrible properties.  Number one...toxic fumes.  Two...highly flammable.  Three..they hose the mattresses down at the factory with flame retardant chemicals that are known carcinogens.  I tried to return the mattress but got screamed at by the sales person over the phone.  So dont expect there to be any warranty.  I had to use a plastic mattress protector to keep the fumes from killing me.  \nWe need to wake up and check what our mattresses are made of.  Many of our pains and health problems come from sleeping on a toxic mattress.  Buyer beware."
"5","Been coming here an average of once a week for overs year and got to know most of the staff and service is great! I'm treated very well and in the mornings after work I'm greeted with cheerful waiters eager to make my breakfast a great Denny's experience. Awesome customer service, I never had a problem with my order and this place is excellent in refilling my drink, will keep coming plus they proved free wifi for a geek tetchy gamer I am."
"1","I stopped for lunch on Wednesday of this past week and ordered Crispy Noodle Chicken Chow Mein.  The chicken in the chicken chow mein was not chicken.  It was long pieces of light and dark meat with connective tissue that made it very, very strange looking and nothing like any chicken meat I've ever seen.  The owner came out and I asked him what is this.  I said it was disgusting to even serve this to diners.\n\nI will never go back there again."
"1","Ordered the bo-bo platter for an appetizer \nThe beef was grey and smelled funny, the bbq was vinegar with ketchup and the egg rolls were rock hard. All of it was like leftovers from other plates. \nDefinitely will not go back and will never recommend this dive.\nWish there was a negative star."
"1","Very disappointed with the 1 hour delivery on a Wednesday evening when we live across the street and we only ordered 2 things.  The food for tge price is not worth it.. I will never order from this place again!"
"5","This place passes the A&A test big time (atmosphere and attitude).  From the moment you first see the towering neon sign with \""Let's Eat\"" blazing in the night sky, you know you've just hit the dining jackpot.  The place looks like it could have been decorated by the Duke himself (the horseshoe door handles are a nice touch).  The waitresses are all very friendly (their outfits include holsters with six-shooters).  I've been to the original location a couple of times but tried the Mesa restaurant last night.  Everything is prepared just right.  Meat, potatoes, BBQ beans--what's not to like."
"2","Third time here. Not as good as before. Salmon not tasty, salad over loaded with dressing. Wait staff good. Restaurant clean."
"4","One of the best gyro places in Arizona!  Large, flavorful, hot, fresh portions with fabulous tzatziki sauce!!"
"3","Prices are great, but the quality isn't the best. you have to pick threw on a few items to find something fresh"
"4","I wish I could give it a 4.5 or 4.8! It really deserved it :)\n\nMy daughter & I had a special Christmas Day evening out, just the two of us, & lucky for us the Broadway Palm Dinner Theater was open! \n\nWe had a great dinner, buffet style. Now, my daughter is a huge fan of buffets (it's like competitive eating, lol), but I'm not. Normally my thought process is 'if I'm paying for this meal then don't make me walk to get it', lol! However, at this place I changed my mind :) The food was much better than any buffet that I can remember having, the lines moved quite quickly & the food was plentiful. Plus, everyone was in a festive mood & it was nice to chat with people in line :) \n\n& the show! We where fortunate enough to watch the musical A Christmas Carol & it was FANTASTIC! Honestly, I have not a con to list about the show. Towards the end Scrooge ran through the crowd, shaking hands & wishing people a Merry Christmas & my daughter was one of the lucky ones, which made it that much more memorable an experience for her :) \n\nThis was honestly the best Christmas evening I've ever had :)\n\nThe only reason I did not give 5 stars was because the chairs can get a tad bit uncomfortable after more than 2 hours of sitting, lol. Still, I LOVE this place & plan on visiting again soon & if I'm lucky, I'll be there next Christmas Day too!"
"5","My husband finally did good. He suggested that we try Alessia's and it was excellent!  Very good service, nice hot bread, and a great wine selection. I had the special (which I could say in Italian because it was beautiful) which was a stewed pulled pork dish and served in the both with broad egg noodles. I was not disappointed!! Hubbie has the lobster ravioli which he also really enjoyed.  Servers were friendly and attentive. We will return!  Yum!"
"5","Wonderful everything.  The food was great, service friendly and nicely paced, loved the patio seating, soft music.  Tried their wine tasting option available that night with dinner and it was just the extra perfect touch.  We have added this very nice locally owned to our preferred list (a very, very short list) for our pleasure and out of town company."
"2","Soupy pasta sauce, very unremarkable house salad. Not great atmosphere in a little strip mall  Would not return."
"5","Dinner was amazing!! I had the strongola with angel hair which I loved, two people had pesto and one Alfredo and everyone loved their dish. Definitely can't wait to go back to try some more menu items! The staff were all very friendly, helpful and well mannered. Seemed to work well as a team."
"5","Third time dining at Alessia's. As always the food was fantastic. The staff was very attentive and friendly. The owner John is down to earth and a professional. Pleasure speaking with him. Nice to enjoy great food and service in a family owned operation. Look forward to returning and passing word to friends about this gem in Mesa. Thanks again."
"1","I read somewhere they won a \""best of\"" so i thought i'd give it a shot. Being from the East Coast, I KNOW a good bagel. I've SEARCHED the Valley for a bagel. Any. Decent. Bagel.\nBagel Nosh ain't it. I ordered a half dozen, so we could try a variety, and every single bagel was nothing more than a roll. Seriously, what's a girl gotta do to have a proper bagel?"
"1","When we arrived at 6pm for dinner, the restaurant was busy but not full.  We were seated fairly quickly.  Then ignored for 30 (yes thirty) minutes, no kidding here.  We finally got bread and water from the single bus person in the entire place after about 10 minutes.  I asked one of the waitresses for help, after she took an order from a table that came in well after us.  She said she didn't know where our waitress was.  It appeared there were only two, and the one who sat us was our waitress.  The one who sat us was busy taking the order of a large table that also came in after us.  So once again, we asked the \""not our\"" waitress who was annoyed I was asking her again and still didn't even attempt to get us any service.  The ONLY reason we waited as long as we did was my father wanted to take us to this place.  So finally, at 6:30 we left and went to Zur Kate, another German restaurant in the same parking lot.  Which was good all the way around, live accordion music was fun. Service with a smile instead of annoyance.  The food was pretty good and the prices were much better as well.  But hey - if you like water and bread (ok, the bread was good) then head on down to Bavarian point."
"3","Pretty good German fare (good sausage and schnitzel, the gravy was a little bland, but this is German food) and a pretty fun environment on the weekend (the accordion player really gets the snowbirds going, especially when he plays Edelweiss).  Friendly service."
"4","Great German beer and food. I will be back!!"
"1","German cafeteria food. period.  I had the special: stuffed roast pork, red cabbage and spaetzle. (sp)"
"4","This place has been in the same location for 24 years with original owners. That tells you something, doesn't it? It is a hole in the wall but more often than not, its those places that has the best food. Not to mention amazing price.\n\nYou will most likely be greeted and served by a middle age woman - she's the owner. She is great! She'll remember you even after one visit. As you eat and watch people come and go, you realize she remembers most of them, even snowbirds. A tasty restaurant that makes you feel welcome? Yes, please!\n\nThe buffet is fantastic. It has limited selection but when it's that tasty, it really doesn't matter. They cook everything in small batches so the food is always fresh. They never skimp on any ingredients so you get lots of veggies and meat. The egg rolls - oh my. I'm not a huge fan of most egg rolls as they tend to be greasy and flavorless but they have one of the best egg rolls in town. They make their own dough and it is never dripping with grease. The filling is seasoned and tasty on its own. \n\nWe only had a couple of things off the menu that isn't part of the buffet and while the veggie egg foo yung was great, I wasn't too fond of the lemon chicken. \n\nThe only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because couple of times I went, I had to swap out of silverware for a cleaner one. But this is definitely in my top 3 choices for Chinese food. (at least Americanized Chinese)"
"1","BEWARE BEWARE BEWARE!!!!! Normally I give fairly kind reviews but this place is AWFUL!!!!!!  If you are diet conscious, eat here! You'll have zero appetite after the first bite.  YUCKY food!!!!!!!!!!  Waitress extremely nice and decent atmosphere but the food truly is inedible!!!!!!!!"
"3","We used to receive several buy one get one free coupons with purchase of two beverages, but now they are just buy 1 get 1 half with two beverages. Their breakfast is tasty, but without the coupon a little pricey. We used our coupon for dinner once, but it was still way too expensive, and the food was just mediocre. The service was ok, but very dusty, and outdated decor. Has lots of potential though. Not sure if we will be back."
"4","The little mesa hasn't let us down for breakfast. It is a family owned an operated place. The coffee has always been good.  Service has always been cheerfull and attentive. If you expect\ncanned smiles and fake. Take your self important attitude to the trendy places.come here for solid breakfasts from a family that is consistently on target with a welcome and a hot meal. As a tip.. always ask for blueberries on your pancakes it is worth the upcharge."
"4","This is the place you wanted to find the last time you did a road trip theouh Iowa or Kansas. Just plain good home cooking. A simple decor, friendly waitresses, and a good cup of joe when you need it. Prices are reasonable and the parking is plentiful. By the way they offer some cute gift item; yeah, very reminiscent of the Midwest."
"1","I have went to this location and the customer service is terrible.  The food is not bad but the people are very rude.  They got my order completly wrong,   forgot part of my order.  So with part of my order I drove back.  Asked the manager to give me the burritos that I asked for and to remake my order cause the food I had was going to be cold by the time I got home She refused.  So I paid for a part order and cold food that I had to heat up once I got home.  Wow!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I won't be back....  My advice check your order before you leave.  Don't expect managment to try to make you happy.  The manager was a woman.  I would say lady but she didn't act like one."
"1","Last  night I ordered the #17 two Chili Rellenos and #19 Burrito and Enchilada.  First, the enchilada, refried beans and rice were cold on both plates.  The green chilis were tough and needed a steak knife to cut.  The burrito must have been made by an Asian.  The only thing in it other than tasteless meat, was sorry onion and green bell pepper (like your last Asian dish).  NEWS FLASH:  NEW ASIAN AND MEXICAN VEGETABLES - ONION AND BELL PEPPER.  NO THANKS... I WILL eat at other places."
"1","I traceled over 30 miles for this cut of meat.  Thinking the best place to get if was a meat market/butchet....WRONG!!!  I purchased a 7# prime rib worth over $100 and found it to be the worst cut of meat....especially from a butcher.  It was grisly and full of fat more than I've ever seen on this type of meat.  Sorry won't be going back."
"5","We ordered the 10.99 special with steak. The steaks were the perfect size for us and they were cooked perfectly. I had a delicious wedge salad and my wife had the best spinach salad ever. It came with garlic spinach. Yum. The steak came with a really good vadalia onion sauce. We have eaten at several all over the country and we get the small sre"
"5","I worked here for just over two years and only left because of health reasons.\nKim is awesome to work for. She will do anything for her employees and for her customers. She has never met a stranger. She will meet you once and I promise she will know you the next time. G Bar G is one of those good ole Boys kind of place. Wearing a tux come on in, wearings cut offs and t shirt well that's okay too. \nCome in sit down and make some new friends. If you are a Green Bay Fan and want to watch a game you better get there early because this place rocks.\nBest little bar in Mesa. Love the bar, love the people.\nYou just gotta try it once."
"1","After my experience and writing my original review I also sent an email to the head pro at the course to describe my experience and frustration.  Alas to my dismay I still have never gotten any response from anyone at the course.\nLet me reiterate yet again that there are soooo many courses to enjoy here in the valley you can go ahead and skip this place because apparently the don't care if you had a bad experience or felt that you were treated disrespectfully.\nI have told quite a few people about what happened and the feedback was less then flattering.\nMy new goals for 2014 are to lower my handicap, loose about 15 lbs and do everything in my power to make sure that everyone I know hears this story and I can only wish that their rate of play goes down.  I'm not going to hold my breathe but it still makes me warm and fuzzy to think that it just might."
"5","This is my favorite sushi restaurant in Arizona. This is one of those hole-in-the-wall places. If you are looking for amazing ambiance, you won't find it here, but excellent food you will. Have never had anything I didn't like here with either the rolls, or sashimi. The food is fresh and full of flavor. Some of my favorites items here are the Baked Green Mussels, Spicy Scallops, Salmon sashimi, and Las Vegas Roll. Prices are really reasonable. If you've never had fresh wasabi, give it a try, it's now a must everytime I go somewhere."
"5","This small sushi shop looks like it may sub-par, but it is in fact the opposite. \nI have been there many times and it hasn't been busy enough to delay service at all. They have a good happy hour and the prices are not to bad. Their sushi is always fresh and I have never had a bad role or cut of fish. \nTheir food tastes amazing, the prices are fair and the service is good. Plus the atmosphere gives you that small restaurant feel which tends to be very relaxing."
"1","Over the last two years the food quality is consistently going downhill. Their happy hour selection is filled with fried carbohydrates and the wine selection is cheap. During the cooler months when you want to sit on the patio and enjoy the views it's difficult to get a seat and happy hour is not recognized. Could be a great place they need to bring their quality up"
"2","Sometimes I don't like to go in because it seems dirty and some of the staff looked real tweaked.  Kind of a nice humidor but don't expect real knowledgeable staff to be of any assistance.  I think a raid of this place would turn up some  unmentionables.  Proceed with a bit of caution"
"4","Awesome lunch special.  8\"" poor boy (hot or cold) bag of chips and a drink for 5 bucks.  The bread is very fresh, staff always friendly, fast service and very dependable for a good sandwich.  Kind of a hole in the wall in not the greatest shopping center in Mesa, but a very pleasant sub shop I look forward to visiting at least once a week."
"5","A premiere outdoor shooting range in the East Valley. Well managed, and affordable memberships and per visit prices.Multiple ranges: The main public range has covered shooting benches with target holders from 25 to 300 yards with three clay bird throwers for Shotguns, A Practical Pistol range with 4 bays from 25 to 50 yards, A covered 40-position Smallbore Range to 100 meters, Covered long range rifle and pistol silhouette ranges to 500 meters, High power rifle range to 500 yards,Sporting Clays Range - 16 stations.\nBut probably the best thing about RSSC is the competitive shooting matches it hosts. I would guess it has more matches in a month than some ranges have all year long (okay, I exaggerate). While it hosts several Major matches through the year, it's membership is comprised of many world-class shooters, so even its local matches are a cut above the rest. It's like going to your local golf course and being able to play a round with Tiger Woods! I've learned so much just watching these guys and shooting next to them. What a blast!"
"4","Small and quaint, the servers are friendly. Food is good, coffee is hot. Even in summer, they have decent patronage. I  sure the winter will be busy. We always like small, locally owned business - and we love our breakfast places."
"1","They need to lay off the ice. More than 3/4 of my drink was full to the top of ice. Two sips and you're done. Is it worth 7 bucks for a crappy meal? Nope!"
"5","Randy back in the hitch install bay is great. After another shop torqued my hitch down to 120ft lbs (really?!?!?!) he was quick to get it right and ease my mind. Work was quick and efficient, I would highly recommend Randy and the team here for hitch installation and service to anyone. Great job guys!"
"5","If you need to have a sleep study done this is the place to have it done. With 5 sleep centers throughout the valley there was a sleep center not far from where we were staying. The facility is absolutely beautiful.The rooms are like a resort with the staff as nice as can be and very knowledgeable.  My daughter had the best experience here."
"2","Over priced on just about everything in stock. Seriously why would I pay almost $6 for a pint of Ben and Jerry's ice cream? Also the staff can be very rude at times and seem like they do not want to deal with certain people who shop there, kind of made me feel like I was not wanted. \n\n\nI am always looking for a good bargin but this place has some of the weirdest policies when it comes to their sales. I can not stand when they over price their meat so that they can make it look like you are getting a good deal when they advertise a \""sale\"". \n\nSeriously since when does a pack of pork chops cost almost $15? Or 2 thin little steaks almost $18? All they do is take a pack of meat, mark it up 2 or 3 times the price and say it is buy one get one free. They move more product and still make a good amount of money. They are not the only ones doing this but they are doing it almost every week!! No wonder this place is always so empty!\n\nWhile they do have a larger selection of some items it is not enough to get me to shop here regularly."
"1","I agree with Ricky C.  was in Albertson's yesterday and also last week, Pork was $3.49/lb not on sale, today it was buy one get one free but the price was $6.99/lb, now how is that buy one get one free?  No store in the valley charges $6.99 for pork"
"3","Pizza is great but this place is overpriced for what it is."
"2","I just felt that the calamari was bland.  The roast beef sandwich was too fatty and the au jus was too salty.  Tirimisu was deliscious though."
"2","$40 dollars for Sauce, Dough, Cheese, and Sausage?  Give me a break.  My wife and I go out often.  This was the worst service I have received in years.  Over priced hole in the wall pizza joint.  We heard good things, we were not sure what people see in this place.  Not for us."
"5","Great donuts, a little hard to find but worth the hunt. Must taste their cronuts and their apple fritters. My wife loves the chocolate chip rolls. They can also make your next party cake. We have had them make a birthday cake and a anniversary cake in the past. Always excellent!"
"5","Great donuts and friendly service I highly recommend & good coffee. I have no idea what the guy was complaining about the owners English was fine"
"1","Will never come back here.  They treat their animals terribly.  Went to their pumpkin patch and they had a petting area.  It was a really hot day and the water for the animals was filthy, covered in dirt and straw.\n\nThen, we took a wagon ride and it was a nightmare.  We stopped at the pumpkin patch for everyone to get a pumpkin.  As everyone was getting back on the wagon, one of the mules started freaking out and bucking.  The wagon was jerking all over the place.  I grabbed my daughter and got her off but, there were several people, many children, on the wagon and the driver never said anything about them getting off.\n\nSo, we rush off to the side to get away from the horse and wagon and we realized that the horses legs were tangled in the equipment.  The driver just sat in his seat doing nothing but whipping and yanking on the reigns while this poor horse is struggling desperately to stand but keeps falling on his face.  I finally ask him if he realizes the horses legs are tangled and he finally decides it might be a good idea to get the people off the wagon.  But, even as the people are getting off, he's still whipping and yanking on the reigns of this poor horse who is struggling and panicking trying to stand up.   It was awful.  We ended up walking back and I did tell management but, 5 minutes later, this guy was heading out with another group, same horse and wagon.  I will never go back there again."
"1","My child was enrolled in the pre-k program, at this location, for about a month. During this time she had trouble with another little boy in the class making violent and sexual remarks toward her, including threats to have her head smashed in with a hammer and her private area licked. \n\nThe Center director talked to my child and the little boy, and came to the conclusion that nothing happened. In her follow up conversation with me she implied that my child needed counseling, while dismissing my concerns and allowing this little boy with known disciplinary issues to remain in the classroom. My child was pulled out of the classroom and placed with 3 year olds! \n\nNot comfortable that my child would be protected in the environment, I decided to pull her out and enroll in another local daycare center. We have had no further issues since transferring and ALL inappropriate words and actions have stopped! She is no longer afraid to go to school in the morning. It saddens me that one child who clearly has issues would be allowed to taint an entire room of children. After 3+ years with kindercare in another state I am incredibly disappointed with the way this situation was handled and am no longer a customer."
"2","We have been there on 2 occasions.  Both times we had very slow service even though there was hardly anyone in there.  The food was good.  I had the fish and chips the first time.  They only have them on special days.  I felt like fish and chips again so my son looked up the menu on the Internet, called and yes it was the special of the day.  Went in at 3:00 p.m. where they seated us and took our drink order.  The waitress didn't come back!  She was busy chatting to other customers.  Finally she came back over to us as she noticed that my husband's drink was empty.  Then she asked what we would like to order and we all said fish and chips.  She said there were out of them and also out of one of the other specials of the day.  Then she tried to serve us the wrong order.  Slow, slow, slow.  Next time we are going to order carry out."
"4","the local north mesa restaurant. after 5, prepare for a wait.. daily. happy hour and a small but ok variety of craft beer and mixers, wine of course. bar is crowded usually, service is fast, staff is friendly, a nice place to take the family. i have been at least 5 times, and won't discourage you from going. fare is decent, specials keep it interesting. fun to watch the kitchen in rush hour. nice, open, friendly, and carries local craft beer. 4 stars!"
"2","Oh Red, White and Brew your customer service  needs so much work.  We had a group of 10, person #1 arrived at  4:40 and was given a pager and told we couldn't be seated until everyone arrived. At 5:15 8 people had arrived and you still wouldn't seat us.  After a discussion with the manager, he agreed to finally seat us but only a table for 8!  Within minutes, the other 2 people arrived with no where to sit.  Long story short, after an hour and 20 minutes we finally got an extra table (after being told they were too busy to give us that extra  table).  Food was good...but customer service is just as important. I won't be back!"
"1","Seems like every time we go to this branch there is 5-10 people in line and only two tellers. (Which is not too bad because lets face it BoA stock has dropped from $54.85 to $16.64 so you might expect a little penny pinching.) However there is no excuse for tellers to be so busy and have one or two supervisors wandering the floor shuffling papers and fooling with computer tablets. This one clown actually went to every person in line and asked why they were there and offered to show them how to use the ATM as if no one ever used an ATM before. Jump in and help the tellers when you see more than 5 people in line how about some team spirit instead of that's not my job."
"3","Not my favorite of the local baristas but it's Starbucks...terribly consistent."
"1","This location tends to have problems with the food. A lot of times I will have to wait for a new batch of food to be made because what they have kept under the heat lamps for who knows how long needs to be replaced. Typical Panda store. Considering the competition nearby I am surprised they stay in business here."
"5","I have been riding and racing bikes for 35+ years (I'm kinda old). I have been a shop rat since I was about 10 years old racing BMX. From there I moved to Mtb, then road and eventually tri. I really like bikes, but more importantly, I like bike people. It is a great culture (cult), and the center piece of any good cult is a local place of worship - in this case the bike shop, and more specifically DNA.\n\nI have been a regular at DNA since the day it opened. These folks like bikes, and they get bike people - because that are all riders. BMX? Yep. Mtb? Check. Road? Huhuh! Tri? Got it. There are lots of shops that will take your money and give you stuff, but these folks take your money and give you a bike!\n\nThe service guys (we'll call them servants) have been outstanding. I have used them reliably for race tune-ups, fittings and general maintenace for years. They are great. \n\nI am defintely a fan of this little shop, staff is smart and their service is proven. They have a very broad selection of bikes, styles and sizes, so you will definitely find something to straddle :-). And an added bonus is one of the owners mistakenly asked how old my grandchildren are... Only to be told they are actually my own kids. What joksters! I hope.\n\nAsk for Ryan when all else fails when you are stolling the aisles looking for your next sled. He is sorta like the shop dog - he takes the kicks, and gives the love :)"
"1","Eww. I ordered a cheeseburger from this spot, & was so grossed out by what they served up. Not normal, even for the low standards Wendy's has conditioned us to accept. For $1 a cheeseburger you might as well go to Waffle House, always open with $1 cheeseburgers too. At some point, customers will need to wake up to the fact that they are not in the business of serving good quality food for reasonable prices, they just want to take the money, & will leave you with a bag of nasty crap the dog shouldn't eat if that's what they think it takes to get your $1."
"4","One of my favorite \""cheap eats\"" places. T-bone steak & eggs dinner is the hidden gem on the menu! See photo"
"2","They have great food if you can get service.   Last time I went wewaited 30 min and didn't have any service at all so we left and done 20 min to another restaurant. We just phone order wings and pick them up now"
"3","Better than expected!! The servers were very friendly, the chips were fresh and the salsa and meatball soup were INCREDIBLE! \n\nI can't give more than 3 stars yet as the rice, salad and margarita were pretty bad. We will give them another try as I could live on that soup!!!"
"1","Don't waste your time.  It used to be good.  It's not anymore."
"1","Used this place before and was satisfied with there service for septic wait removal. 7 years later we call to use them again and they charged us twice as much as last time and spent less time draining the septic tank and he was rude and seem to be in a hurry to get on out of there, and we didn't feel like they did not do a good and quality job. 6 month later its full again. And won't help us out with this bad service they did for us.  Would never recommend to anyone find a better company to do business with."
"3","Looking for a nice meal out we ended up stopping at the Sundance just because it was close and the lot was full.  We had the prime rib special.  It definitely was a good quality piece of meat.  It was hard to cut and not real flavorful.  However, we would definitely go back and try something else on the menu.  The entertainment -- Southern Drawl -- was fantastic and the wait staff super friendly.  They definitely deserve a second chance.  The restaurant gets 3 stars for entertainment and staff."
"3","Nice place to stop and have lunch within the Ghost town.\n\nThe decor is old fashioned, cowboy music, very interesting. It is nicely air-conditioned inside.\n\nThere is a selection of steak, burgers, cold sandwiches available.\n\nI had the mammoth burger which was pretty good, nice and juicy with mushrooms. It was very filling.\n\nWould recommend, since there are very few restaurants in this area."
"3","There is nothing quite so apocryphal and intriguing as the stench of a man cloaked in velvet brocaded tunics and leggings speaking victorian english under the swelter of 110 degree weather gnoshing greedily on a cartoonishly large turkey leg. The stench is one of body odor, nose gays, grease, loathing, and pretense. It's an unmistakable odor I have come to equate with bluegrass concerts, trustafarians, and the anachronistic carnies of the renaissance fair. The Az Renaissance Fair is quite a spectacle indeed. I have been to it many times in my life, as a toddler, as a sneering adolescent, and as a drunken giggly twenty-something through each prism of perspective I saw this place differently depending on my age. Im sure I gazed at the strange sights and smells as a toddler in amazement and wonder. As an adolescent I probably complained of the heat and made sarcastic comments at every opportunity. As a grown ass man, believe it or not I had a great time. If you've never been it's worth the drive out just to see what all the fuss is about. There is of course the obligatory turkey legs, the overpriced beer in tankards, the jousts, etc. The highlights for me were the wild men and the falconer. dont ask, just go."
"4","I've attended the AZ Renaissance Festival for over 15 years now and love it!\n\nFrom the moment that you approach the front gates and are greeted/heckled by the crowd of townspeople, you're transported back to a fantasy version of the middle ages. Whether you choose to dress up in period-appropriate attire or show up in your 21st century duds, you'll feel right at home amidst the quaint shops, cottages, and stands that make up the milieu of the Arizona Renaissance Festival. \n\nWhen we start early (a good idea if you'd like to avoid the hottest part of the day and the longest lines/biggest crowds) my favoritest way to begin the day is with pastries or the freshly made crepes. There are several very munchable snacks that are perfect for enjoying as you stroll: cinnamon roasted almonds, freshly made pretzels (sold from a large rack carried over a gentleman's shoulder as he wanders the crowd), heck, even the famous (and delicious!) Turkey Leg is very portable. The Turkey Leg, complete with crispy skin, is delicious but the portion is HUGE, I can rarely come even close to finishing. Additional substantial meal-fare items are the bread bowls (my husband's favorite) and Steak on a Stake - all yummy! \n\nIf you've ever wanted to try your hand at throwing knives, axes, or tomatoes, this is the place for you! There are lots of different games (which have an additional cost) and rides to pass the time and keep the kiddos busy - a huge swan-swing, pirate ships, spinning butterfly swings are all fanciful options to choose from.\n\nWe always try to make the most out of the free entertainment offered and start our day by plotting out the shows that we'd like to see - our favorites are Barely Balanced (acrobats that are talented and are also hilarious), Thom Sellectomy the Sword Swallower (gross but impressive), Falconry, where they show off lots of beautiful rescued birds over an open green belt (it is educational and interesting!) and of course Jousting. The Jousting is a little cheesy, but we typically try to catch the last show: The Joust to the Death, which is the best one.\n\nIt is easy to fill the gaps between the shows, games, and meals by wandering through the shops and browsing their wares; they have lots of unique items from renaissanc-y clothing to weapons and jewelry to wooden toys to furniture. \n\nThe petting zoo - complete with ducks, bunnies, sheep dogs, pigs, goats, and a highland cow(!) - as well as the Greyhound Rescue pavilion with their sweet pups are always obligatory stops to get in our warm fuzzies :)\n\nTips: Be sure to bring cash, as many of the food vendors don't accept credit cards. Also, if you plan on attending the shows, set aside cash to give after the performance - they are free, but the performers live off of the tips and they do a great job, so it is good to have cash handy if you feel so inclined. There are ATMs in the faire, but the fees that they charge get expensive.\n\nTraffic on the 60 headed out to the festival gets really, really bad. Mid-day on a busy weekend can turn what might normally be a 40 minute drive into 1.5-2 hours, so be prepared. \n\nParking is well done - they've taken a page from the Disney parks and have a bunch of people there to direct all of the cars into specific spaces in a very quick and efficient manner. \n\nThe parking lot and grounds are all in a dusty dirt field, so plan accordingly with what you wear. If it is rainy, that all turns to mud and it is a MESS! \n\nBathrooms throughout the whole festival are clean and modern... there is a restroom outside the entry that typically has long lines, but the lines for the restrooms inside tend to be much shorter. \n\nIf you're looking for something unique and fun that will transport you to another time and place, definitely make the trek to the Arizona Renaissance Festival; its a blast!"
"3","Back again this year! My experience was 1000 times better, and really nothing has changed but I did notice a few things...\n\nParking is so organized and efficient. Also, we forgot sunscreen so I stopped at the first merch booth to see if they had any for sale. They didn't, but they let us use as much as we needed from the sunscreen they had. That was a lifesaver.\n\nShows and food were great as usual. I think the fact that we just had a big rain storm yesterday, so it wasn't nearly as dusty, hot or crowded, made for a vastly better experience. We really lucked out today."
"3","I picked First Rose because I knew I wanted roses. Some of the reviews suggest that the vendor is less receptive to other flowers. My advice would be, if roses aren't your thing, go elsewhere! This vendor has contracts with rose farms and can give you a deal on roses. I chose a dark red rose bouquets to go with my cranberry and navy theme. One downside is that she does not keep roses of each color in stock (some are seasonal) so it is hard to tell what the color will truly look like. This was not a big issue for me as I only went with 1 type of flower. I designed my colors for the tables, etc. around the uncertainty of an exact match and it worked fine. Other reviews suggest that the owner is flaky. Yes, she writes your order down on a page of paper and will cross things out as she goes. However, whenever I called or came in, she was always able to immediately fine my paperwork. Yes, she takes cash. While I was uncertain about a receipt, I never felt like she would forget my order. It is a risk I was willing to take. I loved my flowers. I would recommend ordering some extra bulk roses. They are inexpensive, and you never know when you will need them! I appreciate that Andrea never pushed me to order anything, she even helped to assure me not to spend more money then I needed to!"
"5","This place was great. I am Korean and from Los Angeles and I love this place. The food is very authentic and tasty just like home. I ate there two days in a row when I was in Phoenix. I had the Sushi, Kalbi and Bulgogi. My friend had the spicy seafood soup and it was great.  I recently posted a review of the wrong Takamatsu. This is the one I went to."
"3","If you go here when its busy it's usually a bit under staffed. The sushi here is average but they do put there own twist on it. They add a little liquid smoke to all of there sushi sauces which adds a little variety. The first time I went here was about a year and a half ago and I wasn't to impressed with the sushi. My friend went back a month after that and they had gotten rid of sushi all together. Just recently they started serving sushi again so I decided to go back and try it and it was fantastic. Flavors are very different from most other sushi joint but I enjoyed it. They do a 19.95 all you can eat sushi."
"4","Great Korean Kalbi and other table top meats.\nrest of the dishes wasn't that impressive .\nWeekend could be really busy you might need to wait for a while to get your food.\nbut weekdays pretty slow.\nIf you like Korean BBQ, this is the best place in chandler ,gilbert area."
"1","What can be said? I've been going to the restaurant for years... YEARS! But yesterday I was thoroughly disappointed. The food has taken a major turn for the worst... Gone is the freshness, gone is the cleanliness and GONE is the tastiness. Sushi: We ordered Sashimi and a couple of roles. The one thing you expect from Sushi is freshness... Takamatsu sushi had all the indicators of DAYS in the fridge.  It was beyond belief. The fish was stale and gray. The GINGER! This stuff comes from bottles was old and smelled like pine sol... Come on man. I could have brought in fresher ginger.  Now to the main course. The bulgogi... The mainstay of Korean food... horrible. HORRIBLE I SAY. This was not bulgogi. This was super thinly sliced beef, god I hope it was beef, that had been stored in fridge and they later found and decided not to let it go to waste.  Side dishes were okay, but lacked flavor and freshness. Lastly comes the cleanliness. This should be the easiest thing to achieve in a restaurant. Don't need a pricey chef, waiter or creativity... Just need a bucket, cleaning solution, a mop and some backbone. Don't go near the bathrooms or you will find your shoes stuck to the floor like a roach motel. Don't believe me, take a sticky strole passed the sushi bar. After all was said and done and paid my fine of ~$80 to be released from Takamatsu. Lets put it this way fellow foodies. If I knew the food tasted this badly they could not have paid me $80 to eat it. \n\nTakamatsi is an embarrassment to honest Korean Restaurants in the valley.  They should close or get their act together before someone is hurt badly with their food.  If you decide to go there and get disappointed, don't blame me. I tried my best to provide you a fair warning. \n\nThus my review... \nService great  \nPrice: $80 for two adults\nCleanliness:     ...............\nFood Bad.... VERY Bad"
"4","Whoever the owner or guy is In charge there is the man. The first time I went i did the all you can eat sushi. Pretty good. The second time I went I did the BBQ. Short ribs and pork belly. Amazing. Third time. BBQ again. Short ribs. And the marinated pork. Next time maybe a couple sushi rolls and two orders of the short ribs."
"4","Taka-Takamatsu style, Takamatsu style!\nHeyyyyy yummy Kim-Chi!\nHeyyyyy some Bulgogi beef please!\nHeyyyyy with some vegetable Japchae!\n\nTaka-Takamatsu style, Takamatsu style!\n\nVoted best Korean restaurant in 2011!  I think I enjoyed it the second time around.  Takamatsu is located on the Northwest corner of Arizona Ave. and Elliot.  Signage is poor, but once you find this gem you won't be disappointed.  \n\nTaka-Takamatsu style, Takamatsu style offers up Happy Hour daily and some locations have a full on sushi bar.  I would recommend going to Takamatsu's for Korean BBQ.  \n\n(Warning you will smell like Korean BBQ after enjoying some Korean BBQ!)\n\nWe ordered the Bulgogi beef, Japchae or sweet potato noodles, Haemul Pa Jeon or I like to call it Korean pancakes, and finally some seafood tofu soup.  Like the song, I don't know what the heck I just said!  The Bulgogi beef we cooked ourselves on the BBQ grill in the middle of the table.  Overall, we did a fine job and made sure we didn't burn off all the marinated sauce.  This was the first time I had the Japchae noodles and I thought they were pretty good, but reminded me of the Thai dish Pad See Ew.  The Korean \""pancakes\"" were never my favorite unless it came with whip cream and strawberries and someone from a place called IHOP made it!  I think it fills my belly and that's about it.  Finally, the tofu soup is my overall favorite Korean dish of all especially on a chilly night!  The broth mixed with my bowl of rice is the best.  Steaming hot with a blast of flavors and spices; it warms my soul - Seafood Tofu Soup for the Asian soul, I'm working on the book haha! - Enjoy!"
"1","I haven't yet tried Takamatsu Korean food, so this review is strictly for their sushi. The honest truth is this place has the WORST sushi I have ever had in my life! It was a disappointment to say the least, even for an all you can eat place (which aren't very good most of the time). The sushi had way too much rice, three times the normal. The fish was not fresh and the mix of flavors were weird. One roll I tried was the volcano roll which was four pieces of thinly sliced riced with a small center of cream cheese sitting in a pile of pungent garlic oil and had an off sour taste to it. We tried four rolls and most did not contain all the ingredients mentioned in the description, so I don't know if they ran out of ingredients or what. The reason for only trying four rolls is because those were the first round and after trying them we were so disgusted we couldn't order more. We also tried the shrimp tempura and I think they used the wrong sort of batter because it had a soft and chewy texture to it. The gyoza dumplings were very greasy and had minimum filling. Overall, I wouldn't recommend the sushi here to my worst enemy. This is a Korean restaurant and they should stick to what they do best."
"1","This place was bought out by another person a year ago. He named it Taka Sushi but hasn't changed the name on the outside.\n\nThere are a few servers left from the old owner but they hate it. Ending in service going down hill."
"2","Had dinner here with some friends. This place is not the cleanest restaurant in town. The floor was sticky when we walked into our booth. We sat down and was greeted by the server. He brought our waters while waiting to order and one of our water glasses was dirty, it had dis colored water in it. My friends ordered food. I didn't. While waiting for our dish we observed the server saving the lettuce that our neighboring table did not use and placed it on the side. I am hoping they are not reusing side dishes that are not eaten by their guests. I don't think I'll be back to this place. I gave it two stars because my friends that did order say that their Korean food was fair and edible."
"1","they have phantom charges on our bill for  the natural gas for the grills and they charges us for refilling the pool after they had it emptied, take forever on fixing things. now after i went in in december to put my notice in not sure when we were going to have a house they said don't worry you only have to give 30 days notice.. lie! they are going to charge us a full extra month 1500 for not giving proper notice."
"1","Stay away.  Avoid at all costs.  Don't move here even if it's free."
"1","I agree with all the other reviews. This place is horrible. The office employees are not very bright. It took a month and a half after filling out the application to know if we were approved or not, and we didn't find out until the day before our move in date! And that was with constant calling and going down to the office. They are extremely unorganized, and they are very polite and friendly, until you move in. Then they act like they can't be bothered with you or your problems. They can't keep track of anything, it takes constant calling to make sure they are on top of your requests. I would not refer this apartment complex to ANYONE."
"2","I have to admit. I have never heard of this place. A friend of mine, his dad was playing there. They were busy in the Restaurant, but had a few tables on the back patio empty. So we went back to the patio where we had people waiting for us and there were actually 2 additional people there as well who were not eating, but when the server walked by I tried to order and he told me I would have to wait 30 minutes because that is the waiting time. \nWell by the time I told my friend's dad who was singing there, we finally got served our food. It was pretty good and a decent price. The Owner seemed to be a real nice guy, but his employees were terrible, awful. I always give a place a second chance otherwise I would have only given them one star."
"1","This restaurant by far has the worst service I have ever experienced!! I will NEVER go back!! Not only do they have bad service, but their manager and owner failed to even see the problem that an hour and a half wait time to receive our food was. The manager and owner were very rude, disrespectful, condescending, and unprofessional. They proceeded to tell our party that they accommodated us in seating our party of 12 because we took up table space in their patio. Not only this, but after hearing our complaints of our service the manager said that we had great service that our food only took 45 mins to get to our table. Basically calling all 12 of us liars. I cannot give this place a bad enough review. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone especially if you are visiting Chandler. If you go despite this review with a group larger than 8, make sure that you all take cash. They have a restaurant policy that they will NOT divide up the check, and you can only pay with one credit card or with cash. Apparently this policy is written in fine print on their menu. Therefore, the server did not disclose this information to our party. When it came time to pay we all had credit cards. It took us over 2 hours to speak with management and the owner about these issues. Nothing was resolved. In the end the server separated our bill and the manager and owner acted as though they did us a favor. Again I CANNOT give this restaurant a low enough rating! \n\nEl Zocalo is El Suckalo!!!!"
"1","Worst Service I ever had! Our party waited over an hour and a half for food to arrive, we waited 20-30 minutes for chips & salsa and even for them to bring us drinks!! When we complained about the long wait the manager and owner did not want to hear it! It was obvious they don't want to improve their restaurant by listening to customer suggestions. They were rude and flat out did not care to insult US paying customers for letting them know their food took too long!! We will never go back, good Mexican food can easily be found anywhere and this place was pricey and the food was mediocre,  so you won't be missing anything by skipping this place and going somewhere else were customers are valued!"
"1","Went to El Zocalo tonight to enjoy some good food and also enjoy the ambiance with my wife. I have been to this establishment before and never remembered if the food was good or not. I ordered the Tierra y Mar plate which is steak and shrimp on the grill with a side of rice and beans. I asked for my steak to be done medium, when we received our orders seemed to be 35 minutes later my steak was well done and had not an ounce of flavor to it. The shrimp was so salty I could only eat but one. When the waiter finally came back to see how it was going I told him that I was not happy with the plate. He asked if I wanted something else and I refused. I had tried my wife's plate (chicken Enchiladas) and it was mediocre so I wasn't going to waste my time. At the end of the night the waiter apologized and said that the manager discounted my plate 50%. Why the manager didn't come out to see what I thought was wrong is beyond me. Honestly the only reason I will go back is for the music and the beer, my food experience was sub-par. For the price save yourself some money and go to Rosita's in Mesa or El Rico's in Gilbert. \nTerrible food experience."
"2","This place has a very nice patio. That being said their service is not that great. I may have seen my server twice the whole time I was there. There was a huge fan right behind my wife and I that was very loud making it hard to carry on a conversation. Their salsa is way too hot for me (it is very fresh though). The food is okay at best. I probably won't go there again due to the service."
"2","Ambience is great. Love the band and dj on Friday and Saturday nights. Food is ok. The service, however, is horrible. Been going there for a few years and the service keeps getting worse (with the exception of Mike)."
"5","We come here often! The food is excellent and fresh. We have great service and enjoy the ambiance. They have delicious salsa and you can ask for one a bit hotter and wow it's great! They also have great lemonade!!\n\nDuring the week they have very reasonable lunch specials!"
"1","Horrible!!!!!! All I got to say. I had just a pedi/Mani done with gel. After having to endure the painful pedicure and the \""lack\"" of foot rub.. Not to mention that I paid for a sea salt scrub, she out hardly put any salt scrub.. Painful! Now my natural nails are a decent length..He cut them down with out asking????? The sign said \""30 for Mani pedi and 15 for gel\"" my total was 65??? Why? No one would give me an answer! She just punched the total in the calculator that said 65. I get my nails done religiously every two weeks. I go to angelic nails on Valvista and warner they are amazing, give you water, talk to you and don't cause pain My total is always consistent 45 for Mani pedi and gel. Don't go here nails of the world unless you want to be broke"
"1","Last evening, we went to an event here and I had purchased 5 tickets through groupon. I admittedly made the mistake of buying one for the wrong date for my child for a circus. I called once I noticed the mistake and was told I would have to purchase another one. I asked if the general manager( their boss) could call me back ( she never did.) Then when we arrived at the event they again said we would have to buy another ticket and at that point the general manager stepped in.  I asked why I had to pay again when they had already gotten paid for the ticket and that the event was over 1/4 unsold so they clearly had extra tickets!!!! ISN'T THAT STEALING PEOPLES MONEY!!!! THIS PLACE HAS EXTREMELY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE, ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING IT WAS A TICKET FOR A CHILD FOR A CIRCUS!!!!!"
"3","This place has been recently renovated (as of September 2009) to include a Wal-Mart grocery store. I don't think it qualifies as a \""Supercenter\"" because it lacks a McDonald's and a bank and a vision department and all that. But I was pleased to be able to have an alternative for grocery shopping in the neighborhood.\n\nAfter some growing pains experienced in their inventory, they finally started carrying the Yakult probiotic beverage in their dairy section. I drink this stuff daily to stay regular (become friends with your intestinal flora, I say), and have been miffed to find that it sells for $3 a six-pack. But this Wal-Mart carries the cheap, Mexican alternative Bio Salud for 88 cents a six pack!\n\nBut allow me to climb down from my gastrointestinal soapbox... The groceries at this Wal-Mart are not always the best quality (e.g. the bacon I purchased was quite fatty, and the shredded Parmesan was less flavorful than most), but you can find some bargains here. And then there's always the rest of the store to explore for those random items you never knew you needed."
"2","Don't go here if you need anything. They tried making it into a super Walmart but failed miserably.  There is no one around and if you need anything, go to the other two walmarts that are 3 miles apart, in the opposite direction. Super fail."
"5","This is our kind... a real winner-the most godly breakfast burrito I've ever had!! and FRESSSSSHHHHH made with their own special salsa. Love the urban decor indoor, and you see a mexican grandma cookin' it up in the kitchen-you know you're in good hands. We had to wait for a while for our food, but that was good news to us=ignore the whiners who demand the food fast. It meant that they were cooking everything from scratch. It's important that chefs invest their time and love in their food, and it reflected through my first \""ahh, this is heavenly\"" bite of the burrito. I'm so happy I found this place!! I plan on buying their El Sol salsa. Always follow the traditional mexican bakery-guaranteed you will get authentic mexican dish. Not only El Sol was an exciting discovery, but downtown Chandler is a very cute n historic area to scope out! It's filled with many other mexican joints, which I'm sure are delicious. I look forward to going back to that area!\n\nThis beats Los Favoritos. Period."
"2","Pricey for what you get. Pretty good flavor. Service was ok. I'd say go to Elmer's right down the street instead."
"5","I love the layout of this store! The aisles are clean, set up in a classy fashion, and it even has a little eatery! (the eatery is pricey hot dogs, don't go.) It's mostly furniture, so it's excellent for remodeling your room! The only thing is that you make sure you inspect every facet of the furniture, because it's definitely buy as-is. It also has an outdoor section for salvage, or \""overflow\"", but it's generally not as good as the indoor stuff. The staff is very friendly though, and I definitely will keep shopping here."
"1","So, if I were thrashed and needing food like NOW, I'd give it better stars. It was sub-par ingredients thrown onto a plate and cost boyfriend and I about $15. \n\nHe got the Nacho Supreme. It's comparable what you'd get at a Little League snack bar. Chips, \""cheese sauce\"", dry shredded chicken, olives, and jalapenos. Let's say the only thing gone from the plate at the end of the meal were the chips. \n\nI got the \""chicken and salsa\"" burrito. It was mostly shredded chicken (which was dry, by the way), mixed in with some salsa (very spicy), about 10 strips of shredded lettuce, and unmelted shredded cheese. The tortilla was the best part. \n\nDon't think we'll be going back."
"2","Pluses... Location, friendly staff that's about it.  Stayed at this hotel because we were attending a swim meet across the street.  Our room was fair at best.  Everything was old. The bed was so hard and lumpy, I had a sore shoulder for 3 days.  Toilet was constantly running and the AC unit sounded like it was 30 years old.  We paid a discounted rate of $139/night...it was worth around $60."
"3","I like to call this \""My Basha's\"".    On the positive side, the selection of wine and beers is pretty extensive, the produce is fresh with quite a few organic choices.  The natural foods section has a number of pleasant surprises and they've added some new bulk dispensers there as well.  I've had mixed experiences getting help in the meat section but the checkout up front is always quick, much faster than some of the other grocery store chains out there."
"2","This is a greasy spoon, diner, local hang out place that I usually really enjoy.  The few times I have gone I wasn't that impressed with the food and it's extremely loud in here every time I go.  Which i think is how diners should be except it's really much louder than you would expect.  The waitresses are nice and seem to know everyone which is always good to find.  The few things I have ordered to eat have all been pretty bland and not very good.  The Blueberry pancakes seem to have real blueberries but they are very tough and \""chewy\"" not sure how that actually happens.  Usually blueberries in pancakes are the opposite.  The pancake itself was very tough and pretty bland.  I can't really recommend them.  I have also had an omelet before and it was good nothing to write home about.  So if you stop in I would stay away from the pancakes."
"4","Seems like a blast from the past... The servers are truly career waitresses making them honest and probably the best you'll ever find. The food was QUICK tasty and correct. . Getting food how you order it has some sort of perk, especially if your expected to pay for it. I would make the drive for another treat, though based on the wait and capacity on a Friday morning i would not dare a Saturday morning visit. . BUT, if your in the area, defiantly walk across the parking lot for a pedicure.. great little business complex they have over there. . A++"
"2","I'll be honest I was not impressed with the food. Very in seasoned and greasy. Service was slow. I also received a dirty water glass and silverware. This was my first and last visit. I give it 2 stars because the cost is low."
"1","I don't think I've ever had a worst breakfast. I had the Mexican Scramble. It was nothing more than a pile of near raw potatoes with s small amount of tasteless chorizo on top. I had 2 biscuits on the side, that were not cooked in the center. My wife had the chicken fried steak and potatoes... same thing . A thin tasteless chicken patty laid atop a huge pile of near raw potatoes. This is the second time leaving a post/review because the first one somehow magically disappeared. I also posted pictures but they too are gone. There were lots of people waiting outside for tables. There are so many good reviews for this place, so i don't understand my experience. I guess some people really have no idea what good food taste like. @hoosiercafe #hoosiercafe"
"5","As a resident of California I came to Arizona to visit family and friends over the holiday. Today is my last day in Chandler. Soon to be on a 5 hour drive home. I can't drive on an empty stomach, so I decided to try this place out. I order the steak breakfast burrito, and I must say it's quite filling. A white flour tortilla wraps the steak, fluffy potatoes, cheeder cheese, and caramelized onions all together. With a side of delicious salsa. A complete care package! If you're an \""on-the-go\"" type person, I highly suggest ordering the steak burrito. And after enjoying it, take a quick nap before you hit the road."
"4","Swanky Wendy's --- Good stuff."
"2","It was an ok restaurant, but the service wasn't that great, they didn't pay attention to the customers and one of their machines is broken... which was supposedly also broken in another review."
"1","Went to see if they had any liquid for my ecig and whoever was there was watching tv with someone on a couch and acted like I was bothering him by coming in and didn't have any knowledge about the products I was looking at. I asked what they were and if he knew if any of them were good and he just shrugged and said \""I dunno, I don't use that stuff.\"" I understand if you don't personally use every item in your store, but you should at least be a little more knowledgable about the things you carry and maybe try and act a little more friendly in the future. I don't need sunshine and rainbows, but at least don't look annoyed that I just interrupted what you were doing.\n\nSuffice to say, I won't be returning here."
"5","I love this smoke shop so much!!!! Everyone there is always so inviting and nice, and very knowledgeable!! It's a nice play to hang out and kill a few hours!! They have great prices on all their items in the store!! I totally recommend people to shop here, you won't regret it at all"
"5","What a great Happy Hour at La Stalla!  My wife and I go quite a bit for an early dinner and can walk out for less than $20. \n\nHappy Hour is every evening from 4 - 6 an we usually get a beer or two a piece (at only $2) and great authentic Italian pizza (at only $5 a pie).  \n\nWhen we've ate a full dinner - it's always been great as well. The desserts are fantastic ... Check out La Stalla!"
"3","Beautiful restaurant, it made me forget that I was in Arizona. Love the rustic wood chairs, iron chandeliers, and stone work on the walls. Stunning! Excellent bread and amazing olive oil. I had the spinach pasta with scallops, mushrooms and a cherry tomato sauce. It was good but I felt like it was missing something. I guess it just need a kick. My boyfriend had the lasagna and he said it was good but not amazing like the server described. We will be back since I would like to try some other items on their menu."
"5","This is a great restaurant. We ate here several times. Great food, ambience and location. Very polite staff."
"2","I was hoping to give this a better revue. I tried but I just can't. I had the risotto which was not bad but way too much and I would rather asparagus or some other vegetable than that tasteless and teeny shrimp. My daughter had the margarita pizza which again is NOT a margarita pizza. That was not fresh mozzarella. I don't like (boxing) my food up even if I have extra. But this was definitely left at the table. I kind of had the idea when I started to walk into the restaurant. The outside patio is surrounded by big potted dead as a doornail pots outside. Now, I know no one is probably using the patio in the dead of summer but it is the face of the restaurant and it should be kept up. When I walked in I understood why. The whole place looks dated and not that clean. I'm sorry, I really wanted to like this place."
"1","Dr Gentile misdiagnosed my daughter which made her end up in the hospital. She had a UTI that ended up leading to a kidney infection. I informed him or her symptoms and that I thought she had a UTI, he assured me it was an ear infection and sent me on my way. Later that afternoon her fever reached 107!! I called the doctors office and spoke to the nurse and she told me to put her in the bath and give her Motrin. What?! 107 is so high, that nurse should have told me to get my daughter straight over to the ER!  The next day I took her to the ER because I knew something was wrong. The ER staff informed me she had a kidney infection and was very dehydrated. She ended up staying at Carson's children hospital for 2 days.\nNever ever will I go back to dr gentile. He is a nice man but he needs to listen to the mom. My daughter was way to sick to have just an ear infection. even at our follow up visit he said he still didn't think she had a UTI. Even after the hospital said she did."
"4","We have been taking our daughter to Dr Gentile since birth. She is now 10 months. We have had a positive experience every time with Dr. Gentile. We only had 1 negative experience  at the Gilbert office with a different doctor at that location. She told me I needed to give my very large baby (9lbs) formula when I was solely breastfeeding. I didn't like that at all especially since I told her that I didn't want to do formula. I decided not to take her advice and see Dr. Gentile instead on our next visit. Dr. Gentile always respects our wishes. \n\nWe are very happy."
"3","Had a carne assada torta.  It was actually not bad.  For the price it was real good.\n\nA few comments/observations...\n\n- Comically unorganized. There is no process for how this place works.  I got my food but if they actually had something that resembled organization I would have got it a lot sooner.\n\n- The grill was a bit on the dirty side.\n\n- The meat while ok was a bit on the fatty/chewy side.  Chopping it into smaller pieces would have been helpful\n\n- Not the cleanest dining area.\n\nNot really a 3, but not a 2 either.  I gave them the benefit of the doubt."
"1","Total ghetto. I personally was robbed or locked property stolen 3 times, my 9 year old threatened at knife point and almost shot with bb guns. Looks like its becoming a tweaker paradise there, I had to get out for safety of my family. Think I called 911 or police at least 10 times living there."
"1","Had a couple beers at this out of the way dive bar.  Rough crowd."
"4","I never had any major complaints about Enterprise. Make sure you bring the car back how you left it(as far as gas is concerned) or they will charge you $10, a gallon."
"2","Here today to wash rugs.  9:30AM Sunday.  I have used this laundry for the last time.  In past, I have used the jumbo washers for my home throw rugs and for large bedding--comforters etc.  No one was staffed today, the machines to buy laundry detergent --none one of the 4 slots worked.  Chairs are grossly filthy (and I am not exaggerating--I am going to upload the pictures)--and broken.  They have never been cleaned--and they are supposed to be white.  This place is not clean and no one cares apparently.  Last time.  For pricing I'll share:  $5 for jumbo washers, the largest.  They do a good job, and today they seemed to be all working.  Bigger dryers, 25-cents for 5 min (75-cents for 15-min--which is not quite enough for rugs on medium heat)"
"1","I save one star reviews for exceptionally bad experiences and this was one of them. To make it short..it was over an hour before we had food on the table. I had to ask to get our order taken, then ask where our food was. It was EGGS people. It's breakfast. Not a sit down with a bottle of wine, have appetizers, chat... it was breakfast. For two people. My cousin and I walked in about 10am on a weekday. There were a ton of empty tables. We stood so long at the door with half a dozen staff people walking by us that I said \""this is a bad sign maybe we should go somewhere else.\"" And we really should have! When we finally got seated I had to ask for a waitress. After she appeared once she never came back. Until after I asked where our meal was. Usually in cases like this it's the processes that are bad not the people. But wow.. none the less... it was bad. Oh and the food.. was good. Not amazing. but good. But who cares by that time?"
"1","You just lost our business.. no longer open on Sundays is a very bad decision. Religion and business does not belong together.. seperate"
"3","Good pizza not the best! But good"
"1","No problem with the food here, just the service. I have ordered food from here 3 times, once takeout and twice delivery. Everytime I have put an order in here they get something on the order wrong. When I try to make a complaint about it the staff is very rude and not apologetic at all. This location has very young girls taking the orders and it is my feeling that they don't pay attention very well since they get the order wrong every time. I will never order from this location again because of the terrible service and uncaring staff."
"5","Pizza is good...we've ordered lasagna for take out too before and its good. Friendly service."
"5","You can find a lot of mediocre Mexican food in the Valley. Guedo's, however, does the basics right. Beans, rice, tortillas, and meat that stand up on their own. The tortillas in particular are huge, pillowy, and delicious. The service is always prompt and they never lack for seating."
"2","The food is good, but no better than any other Mexican restaurant. The prices are ridiculous! $3.50 for one taco. Probably won't be going here again, unless I win the lottery."
"1","Total bait and switch sales department! Will tell you one price over the phone, then quote you another when you arrive! Happened to me personally 3 times. I bought from Scottsdale BMW. One quote, one price, done deal. Buyer beware..."
"1","I bought a new BMW f650gs twin two weeks ago (May 2012).  It was missing it's owner's manual so the sales person said he would order it \""overnight\"".  I came in two days later to pick it up from the parts department and after 10 minutes of waiting, could not get the parts guy to help me.  Later that day I received a phone call that the manual hadn't even come in and that it would be in on Thursday.  I show up Friday and there are 3 guys at the parts and service counter.  I asked one of them if I could pick up my owners manual, and he said only the parts guy could help me.  The parts guy knew I was waiting but insisted on talking about his days riding Ducati motorcycles on flattracks to somebody ... on and on and on.  Finally I walked out, not happy.  I called my sales guy and asked him to send me the manual.  IIt finally arrived after two weeks ... maybe I took \""invisibility\"" pills or something, because I had the exact same experience a year ago when I came in to check on some parts prices for my friend in Texas (no dealer at the time in his city).\n\nUpdate as of August, 2012.  After sending letters to the VP at BMW NA, I was finally about to resolve an outstanding issue - my BMW \""Ride Smart\"" reward.  It took almost 2.5 months of nagging BMW corporate to rectify a few simple issues with my very expensive motorcycle purchase.  I have read so many great things about this dealer on the internet (e.g. BMW forums) but did not receive even a basic level of customer service and attention to two issues:  a missing manual (finally got it) and a missing reward for purchasing a new BMW (finally got it).  Because of this treatment, I will never buy another BMW product.  \n\nAugust 2012 update:  I made a video showing the good, bad and ugly of this motorcycle.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6koHzbDCCNk&list=UUSZgIbvZItJr78kHY3Y9wnA&index=5&feature=plcp\n\nUpdate 01/2013.  I have had multiple issues with my brand new BMW and finally have given up on Victory for any form of proper resolution.  BMW NA doesn't care.  I am so frustrated with this bike, I continue to make the payments, but have permanently parked it at my house in Jerome until I can have the time to work on it myself and correct all of the defects (hard starting, mid range sputter, tires losing pressure, heated grips not working).  BMW is the worst product I have ever purchased.  I did just buy a new Suzuki Bandit - now that's a quality product with no defects!  Every time I drive by Victory I have bad memories of paying more than full retail and getting no service or followup - I feel they cheated me and I can only hope Karma will ultimately knock on their door.\n\nUpdate 06/2013 - I have been using Go AZ for BMW issues I cannot resolve - they are an awesome dealer.  I will never step foot in the Victory dealership again."
"3","I just finished my take out and here I am. I have dined there once before a year ago. I remember sitting there with my boyfriend. There were a bunch of young adults horsing around. The service was horrible and very distracting. One of the employees was sitting in the middle of the room (it's not very big in there) with her laptop stacking poker pieces. Another staff member knocked them over while bumping into the table. They argued over who was going to pick them up. So tonight we did take out. The food is great. We placed the order and it was ready in 15 minutes. Upon arrival I am greeted by a young lady who is on her laptop who does not bother to  look at me. Then an older female looked at me. I told her I was in to pick up an order. She asked what I ordered. As I list of my items: curry shrimp, beef and broccoli, and house fried rice, she rings up my bill and hands me my food. Overall, the food was good. The vegetables could be cooked a little longer. Service needs improvement. The room has some tables but people rarely dine there. There is a table in the front with healthcare items and supplements. That really threw me off. For a second I thought I walked into my gym."
"1","On the positive side the delivery was quick... The egg rolls were burnt, tasted like they had been refried. The vegetable soup good portion for sure...  The cabbage in the soup had black spots all over!!!  I will pay a few extra bucks for anything else next time..  The last time I will eat there.."
"3","Decent location best accessible if driving North or East.  There are lots of gas pumps here.  Fountain soda selection is good but they can't beat Circle K's prices.  I think their grill has some interesting options and occasionally I will get a hot dog.  They also have shakes and frozen coffee drinks available here.  A nice change of routine."
"1","We came here for my birthday - a friend planned it all out.  I was extremely disappointed.  We never tried any food, but the service - well, that's what I guess I have to call it was non-existent.  The drink prices were high for the quality and the size.  The staff was unfriendly to downright rude.  Granted, about 20 or so people came out for my birthday, but it was a calm group, and the staff should have been easily able to cover us.  People in my group were even clearly overcharged, and staff was not accommodating or gracious, even when they admitted it was their mistake. \n\nThe inside was seedy, but not in a fun, dive bar way.  The layout was awkward, and their excuse for a patio WAY too small for the size of the bar.  Their name is accurate, the Dirty Drummer was just that - dirty - and I won't be back."
"2","As with most fast food joints, this McDonalds is hit or miss.  I'd say about half the time I get out with exactly what I ordered and no strange encounters.  \n\nThe most common problem I've had here is getting sauce for my nuggets.  They usually ask when I'm ordering, but I've learned to double check when I get my bag anyway.  Once, they distracted me from checking for sauce by failing to give me a straw.  I got my straw, forgot the sauce.  \n\nOn one visit, the girl at the second window made it through our entire exchange without actually speaking to me or looking at me.\n\nThe food is consistently typical McDonalds food, which isn't good, but it's what I go to get.  The line tends to move quick with the double ordering lines.  The location couldn't be more convenient to my house, which is probably not a good thing.  Overall, it is exactly what I expect and I know the subsequent stomach ache is my own fault."
"1","The only reason they have my business is because I'm along for the ride already. Can't say they haven't messed up my order in some sort of way. \nThose things including simple tasks like reading the order back, checking for all the items & even correct greetings. I know you can, I would like you to and make your money."
"2","Eeww is all I could think of as I walked the halls of this school for a tour. Most of the classrooms did not have windows. All rooms were dark and dingy. The floors were dirty and the carpet old. The entire school was very quite and did not hear the normal chatter from little children. Not even from Pre-Schoolers. The playground for pre-schooers is a joke. Completely walled up. \n\nThe school might perform academically but I think at a high cost of the childs other development including social skills and physical development, being verbally expressive etc."
"5","This is a fantastic school.  I am puzzled by F.N. review.  From what I read this person has not had a child attend this school.  I think it would be impossible to judge the quality of education by simply walking thru the halls.  I have two children at this school.  Both of them started at pre k.  They have not only have received a world class eduction, but they have had no problem socially or physically.  The teachers and administration are highly qualified and nurturing at the same time.  There is not a better school in the valley."
"5","I totally agree with Melissa H about the cake (having been in attendance at her wedding).  The cake was delicious !"
"1","I was hosting a baby shower and ordered food from Roberts. Every time I called I felt rushed off the phone like they could care less if they had my business. Customer service is poor.\nSo I am setting up for the party and notice MOLD yes MOLD on the fruit and cheese platter. Then I notice that I only have half my order of grape leaves. I called them and Wendy walks into the party with a replacement platter. By that time my guests knew there was an issue with the food. How Embarrassing! \nI agree with a past post that they are a bit rude at times too. \nThey may be known for their cakes but I would steer clear from the catering.\nNEVER AGAIN"
"2","I wanted to get some baloons so I stoped by Party City. I chose what I wanted and asked for them to fill it with helium but it would cost me 69 cents per balloon. I did not realize that they charge for it and what's crazy is that it cost more than the balloons itself. I wouldn't mind paying 10-15 cents each but 69 cents? That's just not right! I left and went to Walmart and they blow up 25 balloons free of charge. The balloons were cheaper as well.That's call GREAT customer service! Sorry Party City I will not be your frequent customer as I once was!"
"2","How about some meat with your cilantro stem tacos? jaysus, the green herb is seriously inexpensive; just the leaves will do.\n\nIn a 5 tiered rating system, and with hundreds of Mexican food choices in the valley, the stars begin to get blurry. The trouble is, certain dishes at Elmer's are just okay compared to others.\n\nRice? Great. Beans? Like El Sol down the street, several whole beans strewn about the refried puree for posterity; no thank you.\nTacos al pastor? Pass. Gristly pork and cardboard corn tortillas.\n\nSee my list for Mexican food recommendations."
"4","I really only got 2 things, the green chili burro and beef taco. I had takeout too, so it wasn't as good as eating there I'm sure. The green chili is a must. Not too hot not too bland. Good tortillas. The taco was good but next time, Ill eat in. Pretty good neighborhood place."
"2","I really don't know why this place gets so many good reviews. It is very dirty. Very old. It gets busy and the service is horribly slow. And honestly the food is just greasy and nasty.\n\nThe reviews say it's a great place for cheap good Mexican food. But it's not even cheap.\n\nThe salsa is not fresh. And the guacamole is pretty tasteless. When you order tortilla chips and salsa... They put package shredded cheese on and not melted.\n\nI had a taco salad and I couldn't even finish eating it. \n\nIf you like really quick and bad American Mexican food and then this is the place for you."
"2","Today was my first time trying Elmer's. It was ok. I wasn't wowed or anything. \n\nI had a shredded beef taco. It seemed on the small side. The meat was pretty dry. Nothing special.\n\nI also had a been burrito and I asked for no cheese because I like a side of cheese and then I add just the amount of cheese I like to the inside. Well my burrito had cheese in it anyway.  I've had better burritos. It was ok, but not great. \n\nMy side of strips were good. I really did like those. \n\nAlso when I picked up my order, my taco was missing so I had to go back and tell them that they had forgotten that.  Good thing I checked before I left.\n\nOverall I just wasn't impressed.  Probably won't go back."
"3","I love Starbucks and love how convenient this location is reference to my house. The recent remodel is impressive as well. The staff on the other hand seem less than the Starbucks standard I'm come to know and love. I have put off posting this review in order to give them additional chances for redemption but this morning was the last straw. My order was done incorrectly and the staff was less than bubbly. It seems as though it was a busy stressful morning but I have my past experiences to back that this is the norm. Finally yesterday when I went in I could hardly communicate my drink order  because the two baristas were giggling non stop at each other and couldn't contain themselves."
"2","The coffee is made to standard but the partners aren't very attentive or friendly. I've gone here a ton over the the past two years, at several times of day. I've tried engaging the barista in conversation and they tend to give short answer and that's it. The coffee and food is exactly what you would expect from Starbucks, though."
"2","FRD is pretty much an average bar without much to distunguish it aside from being stumbling distance from home.  They have poker a couple times a week as well as karaoke along with a band evey once in a while.  \n\nThey've an ok to fair selection of beer (no Guinness shockingly enough) and liquor.  The food is tolerable for bar food, but I have had much better at other bars.\n\nService happens to depend who's on duty.  Some of their bartenders have been awesome while others...well, not so much.\n\nOverall, if you're looking for a place to toss back a few, play some poker or sing some karaoke in an okay but not necessarily stunning place and you're close by, check it out.  \n\nNot a place I'd suggest if you've got to cross town for or want a higher end / glitzy establishment though."
"3","Great customer service."
"1","I was given a $200 gift certificate here from my sister with no expiration date! According to the Arizona State Statutes, an expiriation date must cleary be disclosed on the certificate, however, Total Bliss said that their policy is 1 year and will not honor my certificate."
"5","I went in to look at some tile. They have a great show room with many decorating ideas!! I'm so glad I went there. I got a great price and my floor looks great!! And the price was right!"
"3","Is the best bagel place I've been to? No. I came here for a \""to go\"" breakfast with my man. As we were waiting for our food, he whispered to me \""this place is filthy\"". The vent above the bagel rack was so dusty! The counters, floors and tables looked like they hadn't been wiped down either. We had already paid so we just decided to get our food and go. The guy who helped us was very sweet but incredibly slow. We spent almost 20 minutes waiting for 2 bagel sandwiches and a chocolate chip muffin. The bagel sandwiches tasted good (I tried a tomato basil bagel) and liked it. I also thought the variety in bagels was nice. The muffin wasn't my favorite but was edible. Prices were reasonable but nothing great. Just like my review says, A-OK."
"4","I am going to knock R&K down 1/2 star from my original review.  I know I can't give a 4.5 but that's what I want to do.  While they were great, I found out that they advertise on the radio for at least one services that no one needs.  Keep in mind though that the guy who came to our house did not pitch any service with a low ROI.\n\nAs a reminder the top 3 ROI projects for saving money on energy, from several experts I talked to who wanted to be off the record, were:\n\n1.  Seal vents\n2.  Insulate\n3.  Window shading\n\n[Now, this isn't in the top 3 but if you have an electric water heater then adding a timer will save you money.  Get an electrician (shop around) and the whole thing can be done for under $200.  Who needs to spend money heating water at 2am?  Not me.  That saved us money as well.]\n\nOur electric bill went down after R&K insulated.  Good deal."
"3","I have to downgrade my initial rating.  Why, you ask?  Because they buzzed over the ginormous mole on my neck and caused a spurting geyser of blood.\n\ni give them 3 stars because after they personally injured me, they gave me a free haircut! Ooo thx! :D"
"2","my 2nd time there tonight. Pluses: Our server from the first time remembered us - very nice guy. I like the tasting samplers you can get, the free trivia game and the Tue/Thu specials. BTW, there is NO blue cheese in the extra-charge dressing. The food sounds better than it actually is - not bad, just not great. All in all I guess this is damning with faint praise. I like to look forward to restaurants. Lots of tvs and neon beer signs - I get a nagging premonition that loud sports bars like this will be featured in the Smithsonian some day as an example of our 21st century consumerism ... \noh well, it's close to home and my husband likes it ..."
"4","Stopped by for a quick couple of wings and some ice tea. The waitress took our order and sent it off to the kitchen. When the server came out with our order it was completely wrong. The manager came out and did an excellent job of making everything correct and even took 15% off the bill. I like Buffalo wild wing, and I was pleased to see that the manager has the ability to correct things. We are a loyal customer and will continue to go to Buffalo wild wing at McQueen and Elliot!"
"5","Love Tony for my nails and Lisa for my toes and eye brows! Great please... clean,  affordable..."
"2","I've been going to these guys for 7 years or so. Yes they have the cheapest oil changes around, which includes rotating tires. Look for their coupons. Now it seems they suggest work that doesn't need to be done. The latest is they said the rack and pinion needed to be replaced for $500. I brought my car to another shop which said they would love to charge me for replacing the rack and pinion but it doesn't need it, it's just an oil leak around the filter will be fixed with the oil change. This is at least the 2nd time Jack at Napa (the owner) suggested unnecessary work.  And Jeff doesn't work there anymore."
"2","I've only been into this location a handful of times. Each time it has been incredibly messy, poorly organized, and unless I am looking for something in particular, I walk through and walk out.\n\nPoor quality for what you pay and inconsistent customer service paired with being put on edge with the amount of clutter is enough for me to stay away, no matter how many coupons you try to throw my way."
"3","Hit and miss with this store.  Sometimes I find everything I'm looking for and sometimes I find absolutely nothing.  What's interesting is that the cashier people are always so friendly, but you can't find a customer service person anywhere in the store.  If you do happen to find one, they won't know how to help you."
"3","You spend $50 at a location and they give you credit but if you don't make it there right before it expires then they won't honor it or bend it all. Considering Kohl's used to bend all the time to help out their customers by extending the courtesy of the discount if you left it at home or allowing you to use your Kohls cash one day after expiration, I am very disappointed in the cracking down. I understand that there is an expiration date but they used to honor it 1 to 2 days after it expired for the customers convenience. It is unfortunate that they have gone from being so customer friendly to so black-and-white."
"1","i hardly can remember this course without seeing the scorecard. Its nice and affordable and you can't miss the big water fountain and i can't stop talking about it when ever Kokopelli is in the discussion. i guess i will go back for a refresh.\n\nEdited Nov 3 2013:-\ni managed to revisit this course and i would instantly drop my rating from 4 to 1. If you like to see your score in lower numbers by all means go to this course. Flat, straight, no trees to intimidate and very forgiving and you don't have to think, just swing. i dont stay here long enough and play often enough but this course to my short observation is not as pack as the other courses around, say Superstition, Ken MacDonald, Dobson.... etc. i tee off alone and ended up foursome at 11th hole. anyway the deserted course couple with very forgiving course layout i managed to finish the 18 in less than 3 hours, and i might add, shooting in the mid 70s. to boost your ego yea play Koko or else, for visitors spend your money at Las Sendas, Southern Dunes, Foothills, Clubwest, Ocotillo and many more. (these mentioned above are the ones i like better) and they are better course design compare to Kokopelli.\n\ni will not revisit this course as a visitor with limited time to play. not even $5 a game entice me to play here again."
"1","When my fiance dropped off ten items to be cleaned at the Gilbert location on Val Vista, he was quoted $4.25 per item. At pick up, the price had increased 20%. Not only that, a $300.00 shirt was spotted with grease. We will not be using this location again."
"3","Chen's is 'aight.\n\nIf you're looking for basic Americanized Chinese food this far south of the Valley, then Chen's won't steer you wrong.  The lunch specials are the way to go at roughly $5 bucks a pop.\n\nThey give you soup but no choice, just egg drop.  They also give you a salad which I'm not very fond of.  The ranch they use tastes funny to me, maybe like it needs less mayonnaise and more spices.  Everyone seems to enjoy the salad though, so it could just be me.\n\nI'll usually have Sesame Chicken or Orange Chicken or General Chicken.  Basic stuff as the menu doesn't offer much beyond this fare.  Another thing I've found peculiar is that they seem to use the same vegetables in most every dish.  It's almost like they just switch up the sauces and meats. \n\nBut all in all, I keep coming back here because of the proximity to my workplace and the limited options of other Asian places around.  Between Chen's and Asian Grill in Sun Lakes, I'd go with Asian Grill.  But Asian Grill is like a hideout for me and all of my other co-workers crowd Chen's up on a daily basis.\n\nIt's still pretty decent, though."
"5","When Brak first arrived in the Valley of the Sun back in 2004, he fretted over having to find a new barber shop.  Back in SoCal I'd been going to the same shop for years and really liked everything about it.  I did some searching online, and came up with Floyd's.  It was nearby, and how could a joint named Floyd's Barber Shop not be awesome, I thought to myself?  Well, I really like Floyd's.  Great gang of barbers, 3 of whom have been there the entire time I've been going.  Good local chit-chat while getting the noggin buzzed.  The only thing missing is Opie wandering in for a trim.  Then again, ole Opie is balder than a cue ball nowadays, so I don't expect I'll bump into him anytime soon.  If you're looking for a good, old school barber shop, with friendly folk, very reasonable prices, and consistently good haircutting, no matter which chair you land in, then look no further, Floyd's is your joint."
"4","Great place!\nI've never had to wait very long for a walk-in, maybe 20 mins at most. \nThe staff is friendly and does a great job.\nPrices are consistent with similar salons.\n\nParking can be tough in this shopping center, but that isn't the fault of the salon."
"4","I'm a guy.  I like watching planes.  I like watching old WWI style biplanes.  I like watching attractive women get in and out of old WWI style biplanes.  And I like doing all of the above while having breakfast.\n\nSometimes, while sitting outside, you get to overhear compelling conversations.  \""You know its hard buying underwear for you.  You have your father's irregular crotch.\""\n\nMy previous supervisor took me here one day for breakfast.  After a quick glance at the menu, I ordered an egg breakfast for under $4.  What a deal!\n\nTurns out, it was basically an egg mcmuffin.  So much for the deal, but you cant beat the ambiance.\n\nI took my wife here a few weeks ago, and she loved it.  One of my favorite places for breakfast."
"2","This place has the location down, that's for sure.  But that's about it.  The food is just terrible.  The ingredients are low quality--i.e. thickly sliced lunch meats with huge veins of fat running through.  And sometimes even rotten--i.e. the blue cheese gone bad on one visit.\n\nMy dad loves this place because of the airport location, but after half a dozen lack luster to disgusting visits I refuse to go back.  They could REALLY use new management, a new menu and a new supplier..."
"4","My kids enjoy watching some small aircrafts take off and landing from this cafe. The food is good and service is excellent. It's overcrowded in the weekends it takes 30 minutes to get a seat. But couldn't complain as we get to see some airplanes up close meantime. Restaurant couldn't take reservations and the ambience for family caf\u00e9 is absent. There is lot of scope for improvement, I am not sure if they already have plans for it."
"1","I was horribly disappointed by my landscaping job.  My father-in-law passed so I had to leave the state.  I was not there to oversee the landscaping job.   When I returned, they gave me the WRONG rock for my front yard and didn't have enough for the back.  When they returned weeks later with the rock, it was incorrect yet again--I just dealt with it.   They didn't finished putting in all the scrubs and trees and I had to call a number of times to get it done.  This yard project was done a few years ago and I still am bitter about it."
"1","What first seemed like excellent service turned into a joke! \u00a0The lady showed up at our place to pick up my wife's shears to be sharpened and also talked to my wife about purchasing a newer \""better\"" set of shears. \u00a0She even gave us a \""loner\"" while she would get our shears sharpened. \u00a0That night my wife had a hair client and was forced to use the \""loners.\"" \u00a0You would think that from someone trying to sell \""better\"" shears, the loner would be a nice set, sharp, clean, etc. \u00a0My wife told me the \""loner\"" was considerably more dull than the shears she gave to be sharpened and that they were not clean from whoever used them last!!!\n\nI spoke with the lady about what brands of shears she sells and if she is a distributor for any major manufacturers. \u00a0She is not. \u00a0She buys direct and told me how the higher priced shears from brand names are the same quality and that they all only last 5-7 years before needing a new set. \u00a0Anyone who knows anything about metallurgy or sharpening of metal knows that the higher quality the steel, the sharper you can get the blade. \u00a0In addition, better steel holds it's edge longer and needs to be sharpened less often. \u00a0She either didn't know what she was talking about or worse was lying.\n\nNext day, she was supposed to have my wife's shears sharp and ready to go. \u00a0She called us saying she couldn't deliver them because she was sick. \u00a0We said we needed them so we would pick them up. \u00a0She then said she actually forgot to get them sharpened and could drop them off within the hour.... \u00a0SHADY BUSINESS, SHADY SERVICE, AND A LYING COMPANY!!! \u00a0DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THEM!!!!"
"4","I had heard about how good this place was and when there was a deal on HOmerun..i bought it..I have had many facials and was surprised to learn something new about my skin..awesome and informative facial!!!!!"
"1","I was very curious about eyelash extensions so I purchased a groupon for a \""flirt set\"" at The Brow Lady. The shop is small and it looks like they do a range of services like nails and waxing as well. I agree with Shar B. about the front desk staff. I wasn't greeted in a friendly manner upon entering either, just hustled into the back room.\n\nFirst of all, I really wish their website gave some details and information on the do's and dont's of having these lashes if you've never gotten them before. \n\nIf you live in a humid climate (or plan on traveling to a humid climate), or do anything like swimming or hot yoga, then skip them. Here I was lying on the table telling my eyelash lady that I was about to leave for a trip to southeast Asia (I was hoping to do the eyelashes and forgo packing makeup) and she tells me \""well I'll be surprised if they last a week\"". Huh? So I said \""what do I do if I go swimming?\"" and she says \""dry them immediately with a hairdryer\"". Of note, there are no electrical outlets in the remote jungle of Laos, and no, I wasn't  planning on bringing a hairdryer. \n\nAs she was applying I was already feeling cheated in paying for this once I heard they wouldn't last, but then she commented that she finished in record time....30 min. I thought ok, how long does it normally take? Their brochure and website says 1 1/2 hrs. So now, I was feeling cheated again, like I didn't get the full treatment because I came in with a groupon. \n\nWell she was right about them falling off. As I sweated my way through yoga and then enjoyed swimming, etc on my trip they became scarce. I eventually had to pull the remaining few off which wasn't fun. \nThey might be worth it for a really important occasion like your wedding or something, but don't plan on them lasting through your honeymoon."
"2","BROW SERVICES  WERE FIVE STAR!!!!!!\nNail service 1 star or less!!!!!!!\n  \nI bought a Groupon for three gel manis and pedis.  The Brow Lady is next to one of our favorite wine bars, so I thought that would work out great---park DH at Evo's, go get girly, then get treated to a nice dinner.  I made the appointment for the mani/pedi, then looking at my unruly brows, added on a brow shaping/wax.  I arrived at the The Brow Lady---receptionist was a nice young girl, and within moments I was greeted by Brandi, the Brow Artist.  I was with her for about 30 minutes.  She was wonderful.  Really warm, personable, professional.  She did a super job on my brows---gave a little more up-to-date shape, cleaned up all those \""downies\"" (as she called them).  I was loving her.  She mentioned she does reflexology---so now I am really excited.  I am envisioning making monthly appointments, getting my brows tidied, my nails done, my feet rubbed.  Followed by a nice dinner and a glass of wine.  Does it get any better?  I work hard and a lot of hours, I cherish the rare hours I get to pamper myself.\n\nFor the service, Brandi had to remove the color I had penciled in on my brows, and after, she offered to fill it back in because who wants to go to dinner with pale brows?  I really liked the color pencil she used and how nicely it blended, so I ended up buying one.  In fact, I was eyeing their whole make-up bar wondering if it wasn't time I did a cosmetic update....  I know---I am a product slut.\n\nSuffice to say, I was TOTALLY HAPPY with Brandi and her skill and customer service and I could easily have made her my \""go-to\"" for brow care.  But...\n\nI do want to mention this----I am a really good tipper.  And I ALWAYS tip full price on a Groupon, because I don't think the service person should have to suffer because I have a coupon.  And I was very happy with Brandi, so I tipped her 25%.\n\nThen she passed me on to the nail tech...who did not speak to me, did not make eye contact, carried on slightly inappropriate conversation with the other nail techs and ignored me and obviously was not listening when I told her how I liked my nails shaped, overwhelmed me first with music from a laptop and then her cell phone (I like Alicia Keyes and Beyonce, but not full blast 18 inches from my ears!), made me writhe into awkward positions to get my fingertips under the uv light rather than arrange the work service so I could do it easily, got defensive and a little rude when she clipped my nails too short to shape them the way I like (I TOLD you before you started!), had bright red polish all over the skin at the sides of my nails and the finish of the nail was not smooth and mirror-like, but had ripples and divots.  I was so upset that when she made a shooing motion toward the pedi-chair and said: Go sit there, I told her no, I am skipping the pedi.  I wasn't going to let her do a thing further to me.  I already had a half-assed gel manicure that will cost me $10-$20 to get stripped.  Then when I went to check out---pay for the brow wax and pencil---receptionist asked if I wanted to leave a gratuity for Brandi and Ashley (that's when I found out nail tech's name).  TG I had already given Brandi her tip.  And for the first time ever---DH couldn't believe it when I told him-- I didn't leave even a single cent of tip for that  unprofessional, inept girl---that's how upset I was.  My few hours of pampering ended very badly.  And I will never set foot in the place again, so I have lost the money I spent on the Groupon.\n\nYou may wonder why I won't go there if I liked Brandi so much.  How do I know her and that nasty girl aren't BFF's?  Would you put your precious brows in the hands of someone who might have a vendetta against you for dissing her friend?  Plus, now I just have a bad taste in my mouth for the whole establishment.  But in my opinion, Brandi should be working at one of the high-end spas----she has the personality and skill and customer service.  It's a shame she is wasted on a poorly managed place like The Brow Lady---and I say poorly managed, because I certainly would not stand for an employee providing the kind of service that Ashley did, and I wasn't impressed by the behavior of any of the techs.  So I was really torn on how to rate my experience---I tried to cut it down the middle, but as they say---treat a customer right, they'll tell two people---treat a customer wrong, and they'll tell a hundred."
"2","Although, I really liked my lash extensions and Patrice, I purchased a pre-pay to get my fills, and now they've closed SHOP!!!"
"3","Yummy food when you can get it. It's typically packed for brunch - especially on the weekends. Most of the girls that work there are hot and young... that doesn't make them the best waitresses, but they are usually nice. \n\nThe atmosphere isn't anything terribly special - it's basically just the place to go to be seen and people watch. It's full of the same douchebags and plastics that went out the night before - they still look like their hair gel and guyliner is holding up and their designer shirt maybe has one or two extra wrinkles. The ladies seldom look like they left the house unshowered or without makeup. Mostly pretty people anyway... I always feel like a disgusting mess when I'm there because I just roll out of bed and go dirty.\n\nThe food is fairly delicious, but I think it's pretty difficult to fuck up breakfast. It's not excessively greasy though which is nice... There are many breakfast favorites that serve greasy meals. Their standard eggs, bacon, fruit, bread, and hashbrowns is very light as well as filling. Their omlettes are slightly above average. \n\nIt can also be rather inexpensive here which is nice for the $30,000/year millionaires. It can also be fairly pricey depending on what you get... it's the drinks - that's where they get you. They are priced like mixed drinks, but it's just orange juice or coffee. \n\nThe problems with this place are that it's tough to find a seat, you have to keep your appetite while eating around douchers, and there are half a dozen other breakfast places within a few miles of it that are as good if not better. I do like this place though and I'll continue to go... food is 4 stars, ambience is 3, service is 3.5... this place really gets a 3 and a half. Go check it out."
"3","The Breakfast Club really got me excited. I mean first of all it's named after a movie that I really love. Secondly it's pretty cute and the patio has those misters that are ubiquitous in Phoenix. But, the thing that really got my pulse racing was the idea of jalape\u00f1o biscuits and gravy. I've said over and over how I'm always looking for delicious biscuits and gravy and have such a hard time finding them. I thought I may have struck gold with the addition of jalape\u00f1os.\n\nUnfortunately I didn't. The meal was just okay. The thing that made it weird for me was that there was a layer of biscuits, then a layer of cheese, then the gravy which was topped with eggs. I like eggs, but usually on the side. I love cheese, but I really only wanted the gravy on the biscuits. \n\nOh well, each to his or her own. The place was cute, the servers friendly and I'd go back to try something else if I were back in town."
"2","My first experience to the Breakfast Club.... eh.  There are much better places to eat breakfast for the price.  We often drive by and see it crowded so we tried it on a Sunday morning.  Our server was very helpful, but the food was nothing to write home about.  Much prefer Butterfield's, Taylor's, or Cafe ZuZu (favorite) for breakfast."
"2","I love going out for breakfast, but there are a couple of reasons I won't go back here.  First of all, too expensive.  My girlfriend and I each had eggs benedict and coffees, and it was 40 bucks!  Second reason, the portions are huge.  I am always disappointed to see such huge portions coming out of a professional kitchen, because I realize how much food is headed toward the trash bin each day.  If you must serve such huge portions, please advise on the menu ahead of time.  \n\nThe most important reason I won't head back here...  unripened fruit as a garnish on my plate.  Just serve me what's in season please.  If it is in season, a tomato in summer for example, please make sure it's fresh, local, and ripe.  I was shocked when the waitress asked me if I wanted to add tomato to my dish and then she served me a hard, barely pink slice of tomato.  It's in season people!  Where did this tomato come from, South America?"
"3","I love John Hughes movies, but this Breakfast Club did not live up to its namesake. The eggs were serviceable, but the potatoes O'Brian (I learned a new thing here!) were nothing special--kind of soft and oily, with large chunks of pepper. The jalepeno biscuits, which sounded conceptually grand, were not quite what I'd call a biscuit. They were tough, unflavorful little disks with jalepenos baked in. The heuvos rancheros looked like something my cat barfed up, however, they tasted fine, according to my breakfastmate. \n\nOverall, I think this was a shade greasier than we were expecting. And outdoor seating is nice, but a mixed bag when abutting a busy road. The service was good, but something about the waitresses reminded me of the Stepford Wives."
"3","Went here for spring training, the portions are HUGE! (My friend ordered an omelet). I ordered a traditional benedict. The hollandaise was a little liquidity and my egg was poached just a little too much (the yolk didn't spill) so I wasn't crazy about my breakfast, but it wasn't bad."
"4","The Challah Bread French Toast was unique.   A good menu with items that are not associated with the normal \""breakfast place.\""  \n\nBusy place but efficient and friendly.  I would love to go back again if I make it back in the area from Chicago."
"4","Yum! I visited this place after hiking Camelback one morning, and it was just what I needed. \n\nIt's a relatively busy place, especially on a weekend morning, so even though it's been around for a while, I hadn't decided to check it out until recently. And I'm glad I did. Definitely expect to wait, but if you've got good company, you can hang out in their waiting area - the coffee bar - and get yourself some drinks to start with and just chit chat.\n\nThe atmosphere is lively but relaxing; easy to zone out and be in your own little universe. My friend and I ordered two different dishes we were interested in trying and split them - a challah french toast dish and an eggs benedict dish. Both were amazing! We were not disappointed. Though probably not my most favorite french toast in all my life time (I love challah french toast, only way to go), it was quite memorable and something that would encourage me to return so that I can try some of their other items; though knowing me I always seem to go back to what is tried and true.\n\nGive this place a try, you won't be disappointed. Service was fast and friendly, so even though you'll most likely have to wait for a table, it's worth it."
"3","Good place to grab breakie in Scottsdale. I had the traditional Benedict and it was quite tasty. Service was fast and friendly and the wait wasn't bad at all. We grabbed a latte from the coffee bar and sat inside for a few minutes before they had a patio table ready for us. If I return I'll try to Cinnamon Challah French Toast."
"2","I've never written a review before but after my experience here, I thought I would come and give my two cents.\n\nI suggested coming here with my boyfriend and his friend for his birthday since we were on this side of town. Big mistake. The hostess told us 25 minutes and we ended up waiting closer to 45 minutes. When our friend asked about the long wait they assured us that the 7 tables in front of us would be seated if we waited just 10 minutes more. I wish they would've just over estimated the time so we would be prepared for a long wait. \n\nI have never been more embarrassed in my life to suggest a place when the hostess seated us at a wet table and threw the menus down and walked away after seating us. After that, it didn't matter how hip or delicious the food was, I am never going back here."
"3","Good, but not great, see-and-be-seen Joint with a pretentious attitude regarding their vibe/food. Frankly, after all the raves and top tens, I expected more. Blueberry pancakes -- good. Bacon -- very good. Eggs -- runny (ordered over-medium). Fresh fruit -- very good.\n\nWhile eating our breakfast, my wife and I were lamenting that we didn't go back to the Daily Dose, one block down. Again, the BC was good, but just good.\nLive and learn."
"4","Excellent location!\n\nI have been to this establishment a few times and would recommend sitting outside, because the interior gets a little noisy.\n\nIf you experience high wait times, just walk around the neighborhood!  There is a nice bakery nearby, as well as a little coffee shop.\n\nWhile I'm not a fan of their biscuits and gravy, the pancakes keep bringing me back.\n\nTheir pancakes are infused with a lot of flavors and the portions will fill you up fast.\n\nPrices are somewhat affordable, but a family of 4-5 can easily rack up a $60 bill.\n\nDon't hesitate to visit.  This is one of the best breakfast joints in Phoenix."
"2","5-27-13 Memorial Day. We were the first people in the restaurant at 6am. I ordered huevos rancheros and my friends ordered biscuits and gravy. All three of our orders came out luke warm at best. We were the first orders in, no one else was in the restaurant. $41 for breakfast was not worth it. Did we tell our server you may ask? No we did not. We are in the industry as well and didn't want to be a bother. The service was fine but the food was sub par. In my experience in the restaurant industry I understand mistakes happen, orders are messed up, and food is sometimes cold. However when you are the very first order of the day there is no excuse."
"3","Breakfast club has a good name and location at the north tip of Old Town Scottsdale. This place seems to always be packed on the weekends for breaky and brunch. Therefore, I recommend you find a day off, like a Tuesday morning to check it out. You'll get better faster service, wont be all noisy and you'll really be able to enjoy what this place has to offer: which is a very good staff and bright enjoyable atmosphere. \n\nFood: The food menu is decent, but nothing to write home about. You'll have your normal southwest breakfast dishes, pancakes, omelets, and skillets. I guess what they are known for are their selection of Benedict style eggs using different types of genres with hollandaise. Cant complain. \n\nOverall, its a solid stop and a place you should check out. It may end up being your fav breakfast place as many of my friends state that it is. I however put it as a solid back up to my favorites if they are too packed. All in all, I recommend, but its not at the very top."
"5","I finally made it to the breakfast club! The food was delicious and the place was gorgeous."
"4","The breakfast menu is excellent.  Our group of nine was seated quickly and the service was great.  It's definitely a place I would return to for a brunch date or a special occasion."
"2","I've been to the Breakfast Club several times now and it just gets worse and worse. The only thing this place has going for it is the cheap breakfast cocktails and you're gonna need one if you want to stomach the food. \nFirstly it is expensive. Secondly it is greasy when it feels like they claim to be a health type restaurant. Thirdly they have messed up my order almost every single time. Often things are missing that I asked for or cheese on an omelet isn't melted - that's just plain unappetizing! There are plenty of other breakfast places in the surrounding area that are more worth your while. Skip this place and go elsewhere!"
"5","The best american breakfast i've ever had, hands down.\n\nGreat service, great coffee, great start to the day.\n\nBetter than any place I've been to in college towns or new york city(where I'm from)\n\nThe pancakes(with bananas foster) were out of this world and went great with the quick start loaded breakfast."
"5","Great spot to start your day. Fresh orange juice. I highly recommend just make sure you have time for waiting cause they always busy."
"4","It figures that the team at Pac Bell Park would have an equally nice place to play at for Spring Training.\n\nScottsdale is easily one of the nicest small ballparks I've been to.  The layout is fantastic.  The seats down at field level are a iittle snug - and I'm by no means a wide guy (6' 3\"" and 180 so I'm tall... but not wide) - and I do wish they were angled in towards home a little more.  Also, before the game, especially if you got tickets in the first two rows, expect to battle the kiddies waiting for autographs just to get to your seat until at least 5 minutes before gametime.  The lawn area is by far a more comfortable experience, but get there early and set up because it gets crowded.\n\nThe food is pretty standard ballpark fare, on the pricey side, but definitely the thing to go for are the Island Wok Pan-Fried Soba noodles.  Go for the teriyaki chicken, add some sriracha, and you get a very good sized meal for around $8.\n\nAlso kudos to the beer and lemonade guys walking the stands for not being obnoxious while the game is going on.\n\nParking... the best suggestion I have in the couple times I've been here is to drive down 2nd, 1st, Main, and McKnight between 75th and Miller just north of the park.  It's all free street parking, but it fills up fast.  Take 75th Street south to the back entrance into the Stadium.  $20 for parking is absurd.  It's why I docked this place a star.\n\nAwesome Giants Dugout Store. \n\nLet's Go Giants!"
"5","great time"
"1","I cosigned my car with these guys and they failed me miserably. Not only did they sell my car for about half of what it was worth but their customer service was horrid. These guys do not care about anything except making their outrageous fees and commissions. They will say anything to get you to cosign without a reserve but don't do it! Once you sign you can kiss your ass and your car good bye. Any of the other auction houses will treat you much better and let you protect yourself with a reasonable reserve."
"4","I've been obsessed with the Bread Basket granola for years now... it's soft and sweet and salty all at once and goes perfect with yogurt and fruit for breakfast!  I usually purchase it at Sunflower (which is now Sprouts), but I decided to pop my head in their actual store the other day to see what other tasty treats they have...\n\nI was pleasantly surprised that a tiny little storefront had such a variety of options to choose from (including my fave granola).  I could have literally purchased one of everything but I took it easy as I know I'll be back.  I went for a few muffins (raspberry and apple cinnamon) and of course some of the original granola that I so love.  It was hard to say no to the cookies and fresh made breads, etc... and I learned that they offer a full lunch menu full of salads, sandwiches, and soups too.\n\nService (from a fellow named Reuf) couldn't have been more friendly.  I'll definitely be back soon and can safely say that \""Yay! I'm a fan.\"""
"3","White Cosmo's.  All i'm sayin' ...\n\nwell-not really ALL i'm saying but it should be enough to get you in the door to try one.  This bar has one of my top favorite drinks-and yes, it is their White Cosmopolitan. The atmosphere is usually pretty good but not always the most impressive.  I've never been disappointed by their DJ's though. I have found some awesome new music because of them-not always the same Top 40 remixes, on more than 3 occasions i have gone up to the DJ to ask what song it was and never heard of the artist and such.  I find that to be a great refreshment in the Scottsdale Club Scene.\nOther than that i have to give credit to the bartenders here. on a few occasions my girlfriends and I have gone in for our favorite cocktail (ladies-what is it???) and the bar will be kinda dead-they will always chat it up with us and keep us entertained while they can so that we can enjoy our drinks without feeling like we're in an empty bar.  Also-when it's packed-they are super efficient.  (Thumbs Up)"
"4","I'm from Texas, so I'm used to Tex-Mex, and this was a little different, mostly in a good way.\n\nI had a combo to try some different things.\n1) Beef taco - fantastic, the taco shell was fresh and the beef was delicious\n2) Red beef tamale - the biggest tamale I have ever seen.  Maybe too big, as the beef flavor was lost\n3) Bean burrito - fairly plain, beans and some cheese in a tortilla, no sauce or anything.\n\nThe rice and beans were good, and the side of guac I got tasted just like I make at home, so I was happy with it.  The margarita was also decent, nothing fancy but tasty and with a salted cup - not frozen junk out of a machine, but freshly made.\n\nUnfortunately the salsa didn't impress me, but I think that is because I'm used to a thicker salsa.  It was runny with some chili seeds that gave a little kick, but not a lot of flavor.\n\nI'd go back though, I think I'd try a chimi or more tacos next time."
"3","Reading 944 isn't going to make you smarter that is for sure. Although Shannon says they have improved...I recently started reading their magazine and their is much room for improvement still. \n\nNow 944 is a magazine based on the the glam and fun of being a twenty something, but they do feature articles so why not put something mildly interesting instead of the \""sexy summer positions\"". \nIn this magazine you will find tons of pictures from clubs and private parties around the valley as well as some fashion spreads and some very short articles. Their writers aren't bad though I will give them that. \n\nGuilty Pleasure which requires no thinking: Yes! \nThink Cosmo meets Us Weekly for Scottsdale."
"2","I had only been living in Scottsdale for a week or so and I wanted to find a decent Mexican restaurant and Tacos Jalisco looked like a cute little restaurant, and I decided to give it a try. The customer service is horrible; the cashier is less than professional, slow, zoned out, uninterested, and she doesn't even look at you. The salsa bar is a bit of a horror-taste wise and not to mention that the area doesn't look very clean. I give it two stars because I enjoyed their rice and I have to admit that their  breakfast burrito had juicy savory meat."
"3","This bar definitely feels like it should be on the beach in Mexico, and if it was it would be awesome! I thought it was just okay, not the best crowd, and a little run down. Probably won't be going back because there are so many other good places in the area."
"5","As we were sitting at Dos Gringos last night I turned to my friend and said \""this is what's so great about living here.\"" Really, everything about this bar says 'Arizona summer'. Fun, casual decor, huge outdoor patio, misters on high gear, people hanging out with their bathing suit under their clothes from just coming from the pool-or in our case going to a pool....\nSome people will tout this as a college bar, well it is kind of. However Dos makes no promises to be something it's not. As soon as you walk up to it you know what you're in for. So if it's not your cup of tea, mosey on. As for me this seems like a fun place to spend a lazy afternoon."
"1","This weekend is a celebration for my 30th birthday. Went to Dos Gringos because I remember having a great time at the Tempe location last time I was in town. It was awful. No service for the first 10 mins we were there. After that, was served 2 bottled beers and (delicious) tacos. Waitress never came back. Waited 20 mins, flagged our waitress down, who was clearly preoccupied with chatting with coworkers, closed our tab. Never to return and will never recommend."
"3","Didn't come here to eat just drink but can't really go wrong with 2.50 coronas this is definitely is a college bar and a bit noisy what's wierd is there Oregon duck fans and not ASU fans? Great place for day drinking though"
"2","Maybe I haven't been to Dos Gringos in a while, or maybe this location is just grosser than the Tempe location, but this place is dirty!  The bathroom has a bad smell coming from it and everything just seems kinda filthy.  I would never ever order food from here, if their bar area is this dirty I can only imagine how gross the kitchen is... I'm not really sure why people would hang out here when there are plenty of nicer and more fun spots in Scottsdale."
"4","Love this place. Watched basketball there last night with a group of people. Fun and relaxed atmosphere with just the right amount of \""divy-ness\"". We mostly drank but had a few apps. The chips and queso were great as well as the wings and shredded beef mini chimis. The waitresses/bartenders were super attentive. I couldn't believe how they were so on top of it with cleaning up plates and empty drinks and bringing us new ones. Probably one of my favorite places to go when I'm in town visiting. Will be back."
"3","pretty laid back, good drinks and food. a couple times i went and the misters were broken and leaking. otherwise, like it"
"2","I get it, it's retail . Staff wants to look their best and be posh at fashion square mall.. We all get it.  Dressing attendant was beyond clueless and did not want to help find sizes. Cashiers did not take off censors for my clothing and other customers . All items were dropped numerous times.\n\nShopping is suppose to be fun and relaxing for most. Not here! Frantic skittish and stuck up staff- yikes. I'll try to find another location asap!"
"3","Evidently there's a zagat survey list on the best chain restaurant steak.  Which I find preposterous.  Would they have a list judging the best movie about grass growing?  \""In the end, Crabgrass beat out Ragweed just because of the potential allergens.\""\n\nNo, because sometimes you can make an entire category of things that suck, and chain restaurants, as a general rule, serve shitty steak. Not that I'm judging.\n\nSo if you go to Outback, don't expect anything amazing, despite the fact that zagat said they were tasty.  But outback is worth visiting anyway, because have you ever had their shrimp appetizer served on their brown bread garlic slab-thing?  The bread is better than the shrimp.  It's amazing.\n\nBut truly legendary status is only accorded thusly: imagine an appetizer with so many calories that three could share and still crack a thousand calories each?  Enter the cheese fries with bacon and a glob of ranch and you will know what spoonfuls of lard feel like to your arteries.  This particular location has a number of great bartenders and if you go there looking for a pleasant time and decent food, you'll be satisfied.  Chicken breast with BBQ sauce: palatable.  Broccoli with crab-butter sauce?  Tasty.  Rack of lamb? Surprisingly good.  Really there are a ton of options here but one thing you will not get is world-beating steak.  So save it, Zagat."
"2","Probably not a good day for me to write a review  (day after my Buckeyes were spanked by Florida for the BCS Championship, so I wasn't in the best of spirits.)  \n\nThat said, I'm still one of the more tolerant restauranteurs around, so it pains me to write this review:\n\nI'm dissapointed in this restaurant, I really wanted to like it.\n\n11:50am  My friend and I arrive (good start, nice, artsy, laid back ambience, just to my liking)\n11:55am Seated and served our coffee and soda\n12:00       I ordered The Cortez, my friend, one of the burgers\n12:35pm Concerned about my flight back to San Jose departing just after 2pm, we inquire about the status of our order...something about normally taking 20 minutes, a big catering order, running a little behind.\n12:45pm The table next to us (arriving 10 minutes after us) receives their order as the waitress promises us our orders are finishing up.\n12:52pm Our meal arrives (along w/ our check due to waitress' keen inference that we were now in quite a rush)\n1:05pm Paid and out the door\n1:25pm Arrive at Aiport (thank heavens for web check-in, short security lines, and a 10 minute delay)\n\nIts too bad...the food was quite good and probably would have been even better if we wouldn't have needed to wolf it down.  We were this close to needing to walk out the door.\n\nSo maybe we shouldn't have gone to this place if I knew I needed to catch a flight.  Still, this was slower service than any cafe to which I've been in Europe, which is much more overt about eschewing expedience."
"3","Food is good. The burger is great. The service a bit slow and dreamy. They think they are Bohemians and they aren't. Finally avoid the owner she is a complete ditz and space case...just smile and avoid this cat lady.  Cheers."
"3","The good news is: The food at The Orange Table is great. The bad news is: The service isn't.\n\nMy friends and I have been here a few times, and it seems we wait just long enough in between visits to forget why we don't go more often. Each time we walk through the doors, it takes an awfully long time for our presence to even be acknowledged, then several more awkward minutes while the server finds us a table. And almost needless to say, whether you take one minute or five to decide what you want, it doesn't really matter, because it will be 10 before your order is taken.\n\nBut then your food arrives (finally), and you decide the wait was mostly worth it. Their sandwich ingredients are very fresh, and their olive bread is to die for. Don't be afraid to try this place, just don't go on a day you're in any kind of a hurry. And maybe bring some playing cards."
"4","I'm sleepy so this will be short and concise. Had the garlic mushroom omelet. It was delicious! Nice patio to sit and eat breakfast. Will definitely be back!."
"3","Ill be the first to admit that Orange Table in Old Town Scottsdale is probably one of my favorite places for breakfast food.  If this place is such a standout, how come Ive haven't reviewed them until now? Well it comes down to a singular word that many of you simply may not like, slow. Blowing the whistle in the first paragraph might stop many of you from reading further, but let me just say that Orange Table definitely has its merits, the tasty food.\n\nLocated a few doors down from the famous martini spot AZ88, Orange Table is quietly situated in the corner of the Scottsdale Civic Mall. Parking can sometimes be an issue in Old Town fortunately there is a large free parking structure just behind the restaurant as well as an open lot. Outside there's a large open patio that's dog friendly where I couldn't help but notice that having a dog is a great way to meet new people, dogs here are a commonality amongst the diners so feel free to bring Sparky. Inside the orange walls help to create a casual yet funky industrial feel, that reminded me of a few places Ive tried in SoCal.\n\nCorned Beef Hash ($9) is one of those dishes that can be messed up pretty easily but the OT version was spot on. Thick pieces of sliced corned beef and potato topped with your choice of 2 eggs any way you like them, over easy for me please. I love hot egg yolk flowing over pretty much anything, but on top of corned beef hash its like the best breakfast gravy. Sopping up the golden deliciousness, I couldn't help but notice how tasty the toast was, of course coming from Breadcrafters in Phoenix, you know its good.\n\nFor an Orange Table spin on the traditional Red Flannel (a New England style hash made with corned beef and beets), try the fantastic White Flannel ($10). They take their delicious corned beef, white onions, mushrooms, garlic and potatoes then spoon on sour cream and pair with 2 eggs, your choice. Creamy, salty and earthy\n\nThere is one Orange Table menu item that for me trumps all others. This might sound kind of crazy but trust me on this one order the Jalape\u00f1o Pecan Pancakes ($10). Fluffy light pancakes with sliced jalape\u00f1os and pecans mixed in, one bite and you'll understand completely. The chile isn't spicy but the flavors are bold with a textural crunch from the pecans all finished with a lightly sweet pan syrup. When you order these you also get your choice of breakfast meat including bacon, ham or sausage. I love the taste of good sausage paired up with pancakes, so when the 2 thick meaty shafts arrived I couldn't wait to try one. As I bit down some of the meat juices sprayed into my mouth giving hints of sage and pepper, could have ate an entire plate.\n\nOn my last visit the speed of the service was much improved, but then it was also 9am on a Sunday morning. Once the rush hits you might be waiting quite a while for your food, though drinks come out pretty quick.\n\nIf you're in a hurry Orange Table might not be the place for you but if you don't mind a little waiting, the payoffs are almost worth the wait."
"1","Man, I thought that they had turned a corner when it came to service, but apparently that was a fluke.  I came in for lunch one busy Saturday, gave them my name and no preference for indoor or outdoor, was then ignored for the next 15 minutes as the five top and a three top that came in after me got seated.  The servers passing by wouldn't even make eye contact and the girl checking out customers seemed to forget why we were there.  Ended up leaving and going to AZ 88 instead.  Disappointing."
"4","I have been wanting to check this place out for years, but I wanted it to be a stress free brunch.  This Sunday we had a sitter come in early and we headed to Old Town.  We had to wait about 15 minutes for a table outside, which is ok considering it is such a popular place.  While we waited, we purchased two Halloween cupcakes for the twins (they were not really great, no one ate them).  On the other side, breakfast was delicious. I started with the morning glory cocktail, bubbly, pineapple juice and cointreau.  It is a generous size, so I had to switch to a mimosa for my second one (good thing I was not driving).  I had the Menage with monkey cakes, wow the best pancake I have ever had.  The banana and coconut combination was so delicious,  I requested it without almonds (I don't have any allergies, I just didn't feel like having almonds).  Ryan was our server and he was very efficient and friendly.  My hubby had the green Flannel and a couple of different coffee drinks.  He loved his breakfast too.  Next time we will bring the twins."
"3","Man this place can be hard to find! Look for it tucked away behind the garage structure.\n\nIf you're in the area, this is a nice breakfast spot. The monkey cakes, flannels and chimichurri were all pretty good. Not my favorite breakfast place, but a good go-to if you want a breakfast with some character."
"2","Went on a weekend morning more than a year ago. It says something that I still remember the details of my visit. They were just unorganized. Possibly overwhelmed. Lady who I think was the owner was just barking orders. Maybe we should have waited for a table outside for a more peaceful dining experience..."
"4","Ok so I went to this restaurant because my mom found a groupon and we were starving after waiting in line for the Dillard's one day sale! :) anyways.. We show up and automatically know there will be a long wait 1 hour to be exact. So Ofcourse we wait and wait until it gets to be taking too long so we head inside. Well there are like 4 tables empty and the hostess isn't seating us. She said she wanted to space out the customers for the hostess. Now... I understand what she is saying but we had been waiting 1 hour+ just to sit down! So I was disappointed that that was her number 1 priority and not seating anxious customers. \n\nWe get inside order our food and our Waiter (awesome btw) gets our order and puts it in. Literally another 50 mins go by and we have no food. At this point my stomach is eating itself and I'm annoyed by all of the \""your food will be right out\"" comments I'm getting every 15 minutes. \n\nI ordered banana nut cakes and my mom got the 2 egg breakfast everything was deilicious except my pancakes were a little gooey. Seriously the food alone is why I give this place 4 stars. Only 4 because the service was sloooooow but they put up with a screaming (yes, literally screaming) man angry because his food isn't out. (I mean really how old are we? How embarrassing.)\n\nOverall I'd go back just not on a holiday."
"2","Totally average experience. Service was s.l.o.w.... The hummus plate was bland and boring with the pita bread stale and all curly in the edges. Save your money on that dish."
"1","Well... Third Time.. Not a charm. I have been to this place three times now and each time I'm more unimpressed than the last. And today will be my last! We were given a 25 minute wait time for 3 at 10:00am.... At 11:15 we finally got sat.  At 11:30 a waitress gave us a warm pitcher of water and some dirty glasses with no ice and diddnt even think to ask if we were ready to order and when she finally returned 11 minutes later we ordered the traditional Benedict, the ot style Benedict and the green flannel... The Benedict's come with No sides mind you, so we ordered the potatoes and bacon as sides to split as well. it was then as I was looking around the place I noticed in the window hanging for all to see in it's shame....  A THIRTY NINE MINUTE TICKET TIME!!! In a breakfast place! And a small one at that!!??? How is that even possible the ingredients are egg, breads, bacon, quick breakfast meats and veggies! How is it that long!  It is NOT a huge place! 45 minutes later when we got our food let me tell you how UN-WORTH IT this place is. Now where do I start on the complaints.... it came looking like my own at home attempts on eggs Benedict rather than a $12.50 made to order in a breakfast establishment eggs Benedict. For both of the Benedict's the hollandaise was cold, congealed and also very grainy. The Benedict that wore the name of the restaurant \"" the OT style\"" ... Came with a tablespoon sized crumble of rubbery chorizo, 3 thinly cut and obviously sparingly used avocado slices all on top of a UNTOASTED, COLD, english muffin. The situation was the same with the traditional Benedict. the green flannel had potential if it hadn't come out overcooked and rubbery . The waitress did nothing and seemed like she had expected the meals malfunctions  and when my dad stopped her for the second time to complain she brought me an extra greasy side of overcooked chorizo for my Benedict... THIS PLACE GETS AN F! Failed in service, failed in ambiance, failed in handling customer complaints,  failed in food, failed in taste... Which is sad because this place has potential.  But I'm not willing to come back after this experience."
"1","A girlfriend and I came here after seeing their Groupon (13$ for 20$)....when we arrived the restaurant was packed inside and out, but the hostess seated us very quickly. \n\nWe were super thirsty from too much pool/champagne time and it felt like days before we even got water (I would guess 15-20 minutes..which is still quite a lot). After we ordered it took another 45 minutes or so for the food to come out- again, pretty crazy since most of the options are breakfast themed. How long does it take to cook an egg?\n\nI had the chicken salad sandwich and Mexican soup..the soup was so salty it was almost inedible, but compared tot he super super bland chicken salad sandwich,. I guess I was happy it was at least seasoned. There was so little chicken salad on the sandwich that after taking the top peice of bread off, then the bottom, I literally had 2 bites from each side. No exaggeration. Someone had taken the time to dice the apples and other ingredients into perfect tiny cubes, which shows tons of effort...but the super small portion given and the fact that it wasn't seasoned made all that work seem pointless.\n\nMy friend had the corn beef hash..she left most of it- absolutely no seasoning again. It was the blandest corned beef hash I've ever tasted. She also had a Chai tea- again, no flavor, so she was dumping sugar and such into it trying to pep it up. \n\nWe spent another 15 minutes trying to get the bill- then did the universal My Tab Is Sitting Halfway Over the Edge of the Table so the Waitress Will See it Move...and she still didn't see it, so I had to flag her down. \n\nI would say she was friendly, but overall poor service for the long wait time. By the time we got our plates, most of the restaurant was empty, so it's not like they were in the middle of a rush."
"2","My second time with a large group of people and it was just as bad, probably worse. The food tasted great! Green chili burger was fabulous. Service was as good as it could be. Obviously something is terribly disorganized behind the scenes cause it takes forever to get a meal here. Worst of all, we had reservations! It was more than a 2 hour lunch when we had planned for a 1 hour lunch. Needless to say, expectations were far from met. Too many good restaurants in the area to settle for this."
"3","The food is good, better than most places, the pizza is really heavy on sauce and cheese, if you like that... I prefer mine a little lighter.  The food isn't the issue here, the service is.  They have messed up my order twice, once sending a totally different pizza, the other forgetting items.  For the price, which is higher than most, you would expect better... That being said the pasta dishes I have ordered have been good and large enough to eat all week!  They delivered my food but couldn't figure out my apartment gate code so I had to go down in pj's and get it... Kinda defeats the purpose to the point a bit... But overall if you want more than just pizza, order here.  Negatives:  they close very early, the white pizza they sent me instead of the one I ordered was disgusting... Clumps of ricotta cheese...? Positives: the capellini pomodoro is great!!! Cannoli was great, the flour-less chocolate cake not so much... Lots of vegetarian options.  They really should stay open later for delivery!!!"
"4","I came here often. \n\nGirls: Mostly gorgeous\n\nDrinks: South Scottsdale prices at a club...y'get my drift.\n\nParking: Sucks. Park at dark lot or pay valet otherwise, get here at buttcrack dusk. \n\nThis place is pretty close to a Vegas style strip club. I like it, there's no bs here associated with the Phoenix clubs. I just get paranoid parking in the dark lot. \n\nNever had a bad time here. Then again, never had a great time here either."
"1","I ordered an item (pizza oven) to be delivered Dec. 24th as a gift and it finally showed up  Jan. 5th and it is broken .They said they could deliver a new one in one week, January 16th too late for the party December 25th, January 1st, January 8th,January 15th, the national college championship game.No one should buy anything from them and expect to receive it in working order when you may need it. They will not assist you with a return, you are on your own.Go ahead,buy your wife a gift and piss her off!!! This review is for the online store only ,the people at the Biltmore store are wonderful and extremely helpful."
"5","Old Town Scottsdale revolves around this place.  If you visit, have a drink, late night bar hop and enjoy."
"2","I was intrigued by the great reviews of Pita House. A good middle eastern restaurant is difficult to find. \n\nUnfortunately, Pita House falls short. Falafel was not very good. Tastes bland and a bit stale as if it was sitting around for awhile. The pita bread was not fresh at all, way too chewy.  The service was actually really good.. Maybe I caught them on a bad day, because the place looked authentic and the reviews seemed favorable.\n\nI was very disappointed.\n\nBy the way, my standard for falafel is Mamoun's Falafel in Manhattan, NY with 1000+ reviews. That's how falafel is done..."
"3","A decent substitute for Pita Jungle. Prices are a bit high for what you get compared to Pita Jungle. I have only ever gotten Togo food. I imagine it can sometimes be unpleasant to eat there. They allow Hooka smoking on patio. Even picking up my Togo food I have to brave the Hooka smell. Food is pretty good, just might wanna tweak a couple things."
"1","This used to be pretty good, now, not so much. The place smelled like cigarette smoke and spice. Not good. The windows were covered in handprints, the sidewalk stained with spills. The blonde waitress kept scratching her head, then went and put our stuff in a to go bag, yuck. I saw the guy preparing the food. He just reached in and grabbed some lettuce bare handed and stuck it in a to go box. That was kind of disgusting too. Real turn offs, I took the food but was too grossed out to eat it, so I just tossed it. No way I would return."
"3","happy hour from 3-7.. and reverse happy hour 9-11 (m-th only though). Appetizers, pizzas and sushis half off, plus drinks. My suggestion, stay away from the calamari. I wasn't a big fan of it mainly because it tasted like starch... blech. Bbq chicken pizza wasn't too bad, though maybe a bit too tangy for my taste. Spicy tuna roll was alright, but what's up with the dot of wasabi? There was no wasabi on that plate...\n\nIf you eat outside, you can see all the nice cars pulling up to the valet, but that's about it. Overall, good pricing, atmosphere was ok, service wasn't too bad. However, I have to say it's nothing out of the ordinary."
"4","This place is always hopping and there's good reason why...great food and drinks at a fairly resonable price.  The swordfish is unbelievable as well as there signature stuffed chicken dish.  They also have sushi which makes for a greater starter before you sink your teeth into the delicious entree.  All in all a very popular and tasty place to dine or just chill after a hard day's work."
"2","Things to get at Kona Grill.\nMacadamia Nut Crusted Chicken.\n\nThings not to get at Kona Grill.\nEverything else. \n\nPros: Watching people who think they're at the coolest spot in town, but don't know they're not. \n\nCons: Watching people who think they're at the coolest spot in town, but don't know they're not. \n\nMisc.: Basement like atmosphere. Car fumes. Families (ugh, i.e., CHILDREN). You're still in a mall. \n\nAloha Kona. Aloha. Mele Kelikimaka. Mahalo. Magnum P.I."
"2","Over the years I have been here many times.  Typically the people watching is great, the food is reasonably good, service above average, and so on.\n\nHowever, this time it didn't cut the mustard.  A simple thing like a ketel one tonic or grey goose tonic, which is what a friend and myself ordered, terrible.  Yes, of course we have had vodka tonics before and know what they taste like.  The tonic was either flat, cheap, or something different altogether.  It would have also been nice if they had spilled a little in the glass, maybe two fingers.  There's wasn't anything.  It was diluted piss basically.  We ordered apps and waited a long time so we cancelled and closed out.  Went across to Yard House, much better.  Even the people watching was marginal - maybe the economy or have people just gotten sick of this place."
"3","Ate here last Friday and although I was tempted to have sushi, I forced myself to try something new... and went with the miso-sake marinated sea bass ($23.95).  The dish came with a decent sized fillet of grilled sea bass, grilled broccolini spears and some (surprisingly) tasty fried rice.  The food went well with my glass of pinot grigio ($7), and although the fish wasn't as fresh as I thought it could be, I was still satisfied with the order.  \n\nMy friend ordered the sweet-chili glazed salmon ($18.95), which came with a generously sized grilled salmon piece, grilled broccolini spears, fried rice, and green onion curls.  I took a bite of her salmon and found it to be tasty; there was a little kick because of the chili glaze.  (See photos)"
"3","We hadn't been here in a while. After shopping, we decided to have an early dinner. I order the Pad Thai and my wife had the Maui Tacos. \nFor me, since the Maui Tacos aren't on the menu, the way they were made looked much more different than when they were on the menu. The fried rice looked wet  and the tacos weren't wrapped as nice. But my wife still loved it.\nMy Pad Thai was filled with a lot of chicken and shrimp. The chicken meat was cut is large chunks. Overall, I would rate this entree a B.\nOur lemonade was really watered down. I let mine set for about 10 minutes before drinking it. I should have asked for another one, but I was almost done with my meal and had been drinking water.\nThe server, Diane, was polite and knowledgeable. She made sure our glasses were filled with water."
"2","Nice bartender. Calamari was awful. All you taste is the frying batter. Sushi rolls were fine. Beer was cold! Happy Hour is better spent elsewhere."
"4","Nice place, the sushi was great, I was hesitant getting sushi in Arizona but it turned out to be great. Chicken and shrimp lettuce wraps were a great starter, the Albacore sashimi and some rolls, shimp&lobster roll and Philly roll. Both very good. Service was great and then for finally, Red Velvet cupcake. Delicious."
"4","Kona is average.  It's a tough area!  There are soooooo many good sushi places in Old Town/Downtown area---Kona usually does not compare.  \n\nThe food is just okay.   They are not bad, but they are not great either.   Price points are on the high side.  The service is fine.  If you are in the mall, and want sushi, I'd say go to Kona.  You will have a good experience.  But if you aren't already at the mall, their are many places in the town where you can have a great experience."
"3","First!! The food and drinks here are great. We used to come here every Sunday and eat dinner and hit a movie. Kudos to bartender Mitch for making memories with us. \n\nNow?? The remodel was highly anticipated and we traipsed through mall looking forward to seeing the brilliance. We immediately loved the blue tints and amazing fish tank, then on our way to the bar I tripped up the stairs. Clutzy me? Nope, there was some unfinished remodeling and something wasn't to code so well it wasn't just me but even after the manager apologized ever so kindly nothing was comped and I had a horrible bruise for more than three weeks -- I couldn't sit in chairs with arms or sleep on my right side.\n\nBut....we love Kona, so back we are today and it's crazy holiday madness and the stairs are fixed with a safer ramp thing, but....the bathroom seemed like 89 degrees hot and sopping wet and in disarray, the downstairs dining room was stuffy and smelly and bright as a cafeteria. And once safely upstairs the bartenders were flustered (but we do like Brett and have enjoyed his service a lot!!) and where oh where are the TVs? It is a tied game ...Cardinals are standing strong and I have to depend on the Yard House for yelling out updates. Not cool!!!\n\nGet it together Kona! We miss the old Kona but of course we aren't the same people either...just call me Mrs Z now;)"
"5","Food was sooo delicious! Went in for lunch with a friend, had great service and great food. Waiter suggested a few good sushi rolls and they were so good that we asked for seconds! Also, its very beautiful inside the restaurant. Nice way to end our shopping trip in the fashion square mall at Kona Grill. Will definitely be going back. Thumbs up!"
"3","I've always been a Kona fan. So when my friend decided on this place for the dinner before her bachelorette party, I knew exactly what to expect.\n\nWe had made a reservation, so they were prepared to accommodate our large group. What they weren't prepared for was how their other customers would feel. They decided to place us next to the railing inside the mall, and while the majority of our group tried to stick to general restaurant etiquette, some of us failed. Those of us that were did a LOT of apologizing to the tables around us. I feel like Kona should have placed us in a more private location, being that we forewarned them that we were a bach party.\n\nOur waiter didn't help the situation either. While he did cater to our ladies shots requests, encouraging things like sake bombs, he was also very sarcastic and rude when it came to everything else. He made a lot of off color jokes and comments about our get ups that weren't \""ha ha\"", but more of \""you're all morons\"". Here's a tip buddy: don't talk down to your customers. Especially ones that are likely going to be your biggest tip of the night. Our less than appropriate waiter had a younger female waitress helping him w/ orders and food delivery. She was awesome. She did her best to make sure everyone tabs were correct and fixed a few order issues that her counterpart had no interest in remedying. Such as asking the bartender for ginger beer for our one lady who foregoes booze. He scoffed at her and went to the next person to order. While our female savor went straight to the bar and brought back the ginger beer w/ an apology and promise that none of her \""beers' would appear on our check.\n\nThe food was really good (this is what I knew to expect). Most of the ladies went between pizzas and sushi, both were enjoyed. Their updated drink menu was very good. We very much enjoyed that you could actually see what the drinks looked like on the iPads that served as drink menus. Some table faves included: raspberry crush, strawberry basil lemonade, pineapple honey mojito, and the strawberry fizz.\n\nAll in all, our experience was good, mainly due to the menu and our female waitress (I WISH I could remember her name). I know the bride will definitely be coming here again. As for me, if I'm in the area I might visit the bar."
"2","Came in late for the Semi-Annual sale and all the pajamas and bras were mixed up in size. Woman working the fitting rooms was extremely weird. She only let us bring in 5 bras at a time and hung the leftover ones awkwardly on the rack. For some reason, she also asked us what our names were without writing theme on the board. How pointless. Line was so slow."
"3","I thought Suede was alright.\nWhen we arrived at 10:30, it was pretty sparse...that's mainly why we went here first. The drinks weren't too expensive, and the bar service was really friendly.\nI loved the atmosphere...this place would be really great to take a date. There are little sitting areas off in the corner, and also high tables throughout the space where you can stand and put your drink down and chat. The dancing pole in the corner was fun...I didn't try it but some girls did, and it added a fun and sexy mood to the place. There was red lighting, and it wasn't pitch black, which was nice. \nThe only reason why my friends and I left, was because it was a serious Sausage Fest. We actually wondered if it was a Gay night at Suede. The ratio of men to women was 20:1. \nAlso, the DJ was playing music a little too loud for a bar. My friend and I were screaming over the music. \nThe outside patio is nice, and its sort of romantic as well.\n\nBring your date here, but otherwise, Suede is just okay."
"2","Hookahs are the draw here. The food is mediocre and the atmosphere quite blah. If smoking sheesha is your thing, there aren't many old town Scottsdale options so this may be your place. My bud ordered lamb tongue and was pretty happy with it. I didn't have the balls to try it, but if you do you may be in for a pleasant adventure."
"1","Took a 3-year-old Seiko Perpetual Calendar watch in for battery replacement.  When I dropped it off the employee/owner? told me he could replace the battery, but wouldn't set the calendar.  I told him no problem, as I'd done it before and had the instructions.  I was frankly surprised at his comment.  It's not that tough.\n\nGot the watch back, paid my $17, and left.  When I got home, I noticed the date was stuck between 11 and 12.  No problem, I thought..  I'll do a full reset and just start from scratch.  \n\nThe first simple step is to pull the crown out one click, hold the button for two seconds, and wait for the watch to drive the second hand to zero, and the date to 1.\n\nThe second hand drove to 10, and the date never budged.  The watch worked perfectly until the battery began running low a few weeks ago.  In 30 minutes he managed to mess up the internal workings of my watch.  Guess that's why he was reluctant to agree to actually set it when he finished.\n\nI'll go to a certified Seiko repair facility from now on."
"4","The hotel is clean and the pool area is nice. The buffet in the morning is worth the price. Not only do you get what you see out but the super nice gentleman will make you fresh omelets, pancakes, waffles, etc.\n\nThe really great part about this hotel is the staff. They are amazing and the service is impeccable. They are quick and efficient and go out of their way to make your stay an enjoyable one. \n\nThank you for making our trip an excellent one! We will be back again!"
"3","There is one of these on every corner. The items are so expensive. Its nice, but not really too unique. There are some overpriced random items. It don't like how they all it a Gallery, when they don't really do a good job of displaying their \""art works\"" and explaining the story of why they are unique, about the artist, the name of the piece, or the labor that goes into each piece. I like to support the Native Arts, but this place is ridiculous."
"3","The food was pretty good; although the meatballs were a little too drenched in soy sauce. I wish the bar was a little bigger. They only carried a couple of beers and I like variety...all in all, it was pretty good."
"1","I've never had such terrible service.  When I spend more than $100 on dinner for two people, I expect the servers to at least be polite.  Went on a Friday night, but there was no hostess on duty.  After waiting a bit at the hostess stand, we gave up and walked into the dining area where we were pointed to a table.  This was an issue all night with people wandering through the crowded tables looking for somewhere to sit and standing over diners waiting for them to get up.  We placed our drink order (bottles of wine starting at $40), and then we waited.  And waited.  Finally someone walked by and put the bottle on our table - unopened - and kept walking.  10 minutes later a different server came by and asked if we wanted the bottle open (ummmm...yeah!).  While he was opening it, the first guy came by and started fussing at him because he \""was planning on coming back for it.\""  They walked off bickering - and without taking our order.  After 20 minutes, we considered just leaving money on the table for the wine and going someplace else.  It wasn't that the servers were too busy, the ratio of servers to tables looked fine.  And I could them wandering around at the bar not actually doing anything.  Everytime one walked past our table he turned his head and avoided eye contact.  Finally, we were able to wave someone down when he told us that we weren't really his table, but fine, he would take our order.  Scowling the entire time.  We got a calamari appetizer, a ceaser salad, chicken parmesan and chicken marsala.  The food was good.  But by the time we got it, we had finished our bottle of wine and weren't offered anyting else to drink.  Nobody came by to check to see if the food was ok.  So while the food and decor was good, I marked it down for being overpriced and terrible service.  I won't be going back."
"4","If you are looking for any kind of obscure hat this is your place!  They have all kinds of hats here!  They even have stuff in storage that they can get if you need something that is 'out of season'.  \n\nI happened to walk in a few days after the Kentucky Derby and what a treat, so many amazing, beautiful, well-made hats!! I was there for another need, but wow, I almost wanted to buy a crazy derby hat...such COOL stuff!  \n\nThe sales associate was extremely helpful; you can tell they know their hats (any genre).  They are a bit on the expensive side, but nice well-made hats are pricey."
"3","I found this place last April when I took my first work trip to the greater Phoenix area. It is located just west of the main drag of art galleries in Old Town Scottsdale. For someone who prefers mild warmth to severe heat, the atmosphere was perfect in April. Having just been there in February, the temperature was a little chilly.\n\nThe restaurant has an indoor seating area, though I cannot imagine a scenario when I would try to sit there. There is also a full patio which is why you have no reason to go inside. \n\nThe patio (covered in the rain) has space heaters if it does get cold out. There is a beautiful fountain in the middle of the patio that mixes a fire and water show with ambiance. \n\nThe menu is a modified Mexican. Traditional Mexican meals and tastes presented in new ways. The food is very good and I am told their margaritas, though not the best in town, are very good as well."
"4","YUMMY!\nPretty sweet and simple. I haven't had the opportunity to dine in, but I hear the ambiance is great. We generally do take out when we work late nights, and the food hasn't disappointed me yet. \n\nThe Nachos del Sol is great..\nTortilla chips topped with chorizo, pepperjack cheese, pico de gallo, guacamole,chipotle sour cream & jalapeno peppers with house salsa. (not appropriate for those sensitive to heartburn) \n\nA healthier approach would be  the Tequila lime salad with grilled chicken. The dressing is a great touch and the flavors just mix well w/ the chicken and greens.\n\nLast but not least- you must try the Chicken Tortilla soup. Thick, and sooo good with the touch of avocado and sour cream. \n\nSo next time you're looking for a different touch for take out- you should try Old Town Tortilla Factory"
"2","This place is the perfect example of a tourist trap.  Nice location not far of the main drag of Old Scottsdale, beautiful building and layout.  The margaritas are good, but probably $2-$3 more expensive than they ought to be for every one of the many styles.  I thought paying $5 for chips and salsa was a rip-off, but then when the chips tasted stale, I was even less happy.  C'mon, if you have tortilla and factory in your name, you ought to have fresh chips.  I thought the tortillas themselves were okay, not great, but okay.  The carne fuego, or whatever I had the waitress recommended, was not good.  Small chunks of fire roasted steak completely ruined by a gloppy sweet/hot sauce. The veggies that went with it were just okay and the sweet potato-stuffed chile was weird.  It could've been great, but it was nowhere near good.  Unless your Aunt Hattie who has never had Mexican food is in town from Ohio, i'd skip this place altogether."
"1","Horrible, Horrible, Horrible!!!!\n\nCustomer Service was AWEFUL, on a scale of 1-5 food was 1, drinks were ok, the only good thing was the atmosphere, which is NOT going to change my mind about going back there, I've had much much better fish tacos @ Rubio's & Baja Fresh for fraction of the price & didn't have to go to dinner somewhere else after leaving, which we had to do after leaving Tortilla Factory!\n\nThere are Plenty of Great places in Scottsdale with Great food, Great service, Great drinks & Great atmosphere.\n\nWe even tried talking to the manager but he got all Upset & tried to make us feel like we were lucky to be there & didn't know what we were talking about.\n\nSo if you want, BAD Service, Over Priced & Tasteless food & like to waste your money this is the place for you!"
"3","We have dined at the Old Town Tortilla Factory several times over the years and as recently as two weeks ago.  \n\nThe outdoor seating area is very nice, there is a roomy bar and fairly large indoor restaurant (I agree with Sarah K., bring a sweater).  \n\nThe Chorizo Fundido is delicious!!  They serve it with a large bowl of chips.  I always ask for a side of soft corn tortillas too, they are a nice change from the chips. \n\nThe Plato Appertivo is gigantic, you could feed four people with this thing.  The nachos, ribs and quesadillas were all fantastic.  There is a generous scoop of their great guacamole on top and a bowl of salsa on the side.  You might want to ask for the chipotle sour cream on the side rather than on the quesadillas - it has a great smoky taste but can dominate easily so I prefer to regulate the portion.\n\nThe enchiladas and soft tacos are very good.  Their flour tortillas are great (when they bring them).\n\nMargaritas were excellent and generous for the price.\n\nService can be spotty.  If you're in a rush or are frustrated by slow service to the point it impacts your food enjoyment, this place may not be your cup of tea.  I enjoy the food/drinks so I go when I know I have the time to be patient.  Test it out during a leisurely happy hour and see what you think."
"2","We live in Litchfield Park, but took the trip to Scottsdale based on this place's reputation. The building and decor are super nice in a throwback Spanish mission sort of way. The separate \""tequilleria\"" and patio are attention getting. since it was 119 degrees, we sat inside. \n\nThat is where the fun ended. \n\nWe ordered chips and salsa for $5. No big deal, but where else do you pay for that in any sit down joints anymore? They do bring out fresh tortillas, gratis, but we didn't know that and it's not mentioned on the menu.\n\nThe menu is pretty limited and oh so pricey. $15.00 for two a la cart tacos. Holey Moley, they better be stuffed with caviar. There is no taco on the planet worth $7.50 (maybe worth $7 :-)) and I have had some great tacos. These are not those tacos.\n\nThe fish tacos were under seasoned portions of Mahi Mahi. The fish itself was not seasoned at all and actually had a fishy taste. Not pleasant. It was served with radishes rather than coleslaw which was interesting and the crema which was tasty. But as a whole, it was bland and underwhelming even after adding the accompanying sauce.\n\nWe also had the bacon wrapped spicy meatloaf on garlic mashed potatoes. Served with a zippy red pepper sauce and tree trunk sized asparagus. The sauce was very tasty, the meatloaf was tender and not  dry. There was something so rich in the meatloaf itself, that after 3/4 of one slice, I couldn't eat anymore of it. It just began to turn my stomach. The potatoes were cooked really well and had some nice flavor, but needed salt. That was funny, because there was no salt on the table. The asparagus was well cooked and still had some snap, but like the potatoes, it was under seasoned.\n\nWe ordered the banana stuffed fried tortilla in blackberry reduction and were disappointed there too. The tortillas were overstuffed with banana, so that you couldn't enjoy the crunchy texture of the cinnamon crusted tortilla. It just became mush. The reduction was not \""reduced\"" and was runny, but tasty. \n\nFor three of us, the tab totaled over $85 before tip. That included 2 bud lights, which WERE cold and refreshing. \n\nAll said, the environment is far more interesting than the food. The place's reputation is undeserved at half the price!"
"3","To put it straight, our server was awkward. We were a group of four chicks, so I'm not sure if he was nervous or what... but there was some definite strangeness going on.\n\nThe crab dip is pretty bomb if you like big chunks of avocado... Which I do... Mmmmm.. Also had the green Chile enchilada is super delish. Supposedly it's a spicy dish but I'm super anti-spice and I didn't notice it.\n\nThe super awesome bigass patio is pretty cool, especially with all the romantic lighting. This COULD potentially be an excellent spot to just chill and have a drink with your buds, but we were surprised to be told at 10pm that it was time to close down shop. :P"
"4","Really great service.  For some reason our server was held up and she gave us a free appetizer.  Drinks were very good and the meal was huge.  I hadn't had a lot to eat during the day and when I got my dinner, I managed to polish it off.  The atmosphere was really good."
"3","Nice patio and large enough for a crowd.  X-mas lights and the water fountain reminds me of the Friends opening credit - Yes, I'll be there for you!\n\nCame here with my gang and it was buffet style but regardless I must rate the place. We had a nice baby green salad with some balsamic vinaigrette, but things went downhill from here fast. Let's start with the pork; Cough! Cough! (Pound the chest!).  Someone pass me some water cause as much as I chewed it didn't go down - It was so dry it soaked up my saliva! Atop of it were some chili flakes so that didn't help much. The stuffed chicken came with a nice creamy sauce, but I don't recall what it tasted like.  The pork overwhelmed me and to add insult to injury don't serve mashed potatoes to dry out my tongue more!\n\nRegardless, a friend of mine made a great point; we are served what we did not order.  Saved!  Therefore, I shall return on another visit to give my full report so stay tuned!"
"2","You would expect a place called Old Tortilla Factory to deliver the best tortilla...as yelp would say on a 2-star, \""Meh, I have experienced better.\""  The chips that we got made from the tortilla was cold to start off with.  They gave us a tortilla separately with a cheese butter.  That was pretty decent, but when it came to my red enchiladas, I was not very pleased.  The red sauce on the red enchilada sauce tasted like very bitter vinegar.  I have tried enchiladas from many establishments throughout my life, and this has to be THE WORST.  \n\nWhat saves this from a 1-star performance was pretty decent margaritas.  I may have to come back here to try something else, but it may be a very long time."
"3","My experience at Old Town Tortilla Factory is probably very different than that of the average patron. I dined here with a semi-private party with 40 other guests and we were served buffet-style.\n\nOur group was seated in their outdoor dining area, which I absolutely loved. I thought the atmosphere was great and brought an authentic Southwest feel and vibe to the restaurant. The food was as decent as you would expect sharing buffet-style with 40 other people lined up outdoors: nothing mind-blowingly memorable, but nothing too bad, either.\n\nMy one complaint would be the servers. Especially at our single table of 8, it did not seem the server we were assigned was equipped to take care of a large group. There was much unnecessary confusion at the end of the night when it came down to settling some bar tabs. Overall, it did not ruin our experience, but definitely took away from the overall positivity. \n\nRegardless, I would love to come back here with a smaller group and enjoy a fresh plate of food! The outdoor dining is definitely something you can't pass up..."
"4","This has become our regular spot when in town if for no other reason than the wonderful outdoor space.  The food has always been great - although more vegetarian options would be welcomed by the wife - and the margaritas are sublime.  Service has always been fine but we do arrive early before it gets crazy packed.  (Old people style has its benefits.)"
"2","I went to celebrate one of my friends birthday dinner and I so disappointed. Never again will I be going eating at this restaurant. \n\nTo start off they have no parking lot so you have to park on the side of the street or wherever you can find parking and walk up to the restaurant. \n\nSecond because we were a huge group of 11 ppl we asked them several times to group two tables together (which we had made reservations days in advance) they didn't do it until they saw us trying to move the tables together. \n\nThird the menu wasn't that great. I was expecting lots of tacos, burritos, more Mexican dishes and the prices were ridiculous, I guess because it's Scottsdale. The lowest price for a plate was 14.99 which by the way while reading the menu the food did sound that delicious/appealing. I can say that the green enchilada was really good. I had the tequila lime salad and added chicken. The chicken was so dry and had no flavor. As much as I tried to finish it after awhile I had to stop eating. Margaritas were expensive and the alcohol amount in them were small. The beers were pretty cheap 4.25 though. \n\nFourth, the decor was pretty decent. Nothing too fancy we sat outside in the patio they had fans and misters which was pretty nice however they had this fireplace in the middle which I did not understand. Inside the restaurant is pretty ghetto looking for being in Scottsdale. Bathrooms were clean but really small, I felt so cram in the stall. The bar was alright but it looked dirty. The bottles on the wall looked they haven't dust them in months. \n\nFinally, the server was good he seemed really awkward and nerves. I know we were a large group and did a good job getting us drinks and our food correctly. Until the end when we were about to pay we ask to split up the tabs and he said he couldn't. After that we got irritated. We spent 30 mins trying to figure out who ordered what totaling the amounts each person owed and several ppl were paying in cash while others with their cards and what amount of change certain ppl were going to get back. We pretty much had to wait an hr to figure that out and for the server to figure it out. Not to mention that my bf and I had to pay our tab plus the gratuity tip because we were the last ones. What should have been a tab of $53 they charged us $67 (wtf). \n\nDidn't have a good experience I doubt I will ever return."
"2","Kinda high price. Food is OK. I've had better. \n\nThey advertise the heck out of this place, and make it sound so good, but, honestly, the food was small portions with a big price, and tasteless, to boot! \nOverall, we found no good mexican food in Scottsdale area. If you want some good nachos, though, go to the Fairmont Scottsdale Princess Resort, and eat the Nacho appetizer at the Ironwood American Kitchen. Is run by a famous chef. Also, walk around the property. It's amazing!\nThe nachos here, were made with more gourmet ingredients. I've never had nachos that good anywhere else.\n\nSkip the Old Town Tortilla Factory!!"
"2","3 stars for the nice outdoor dining (when cool enough) area and the service but more importantly in this case 2 stars for most everything else.\n\nHad one of their recommended margaritas and although the taste was nice and light for a warm evening there was a reason it was nice and light...I don't know if they pour extra warm ingredients over the ice then shake it up a lot for a watered down taste or if there is simply no booze in the drink but was extremely weak and my guest said his was the same.\n\nI ordered the fish tacos of which there were three and they were just OK.  Served on tiny corn tortillas with a very small amount of jalapeno sauce and no roasted corn guacamole which it should have come with. My guest had the achiote ribs which surprisingly came as an entire slab. Neither he nor I were familiar with achiote sauce beyond knowing that achiote is a spice but even if we were we would have expected the \""glazed with...\"" description to be an actual glaze and not a 1-inch thick bland paste. The ribs were tender just not as flavorful as one would have thought.\n\nOverall the place was overpriced for the quality for food and beverage.  Disappointing."
"5","My husband and I went for dinner this evening at the Old Town Tortilla Factory in Scottsdale.  We didn't know what to expect after reading some of the reviews.\nWe got right in and seated as soon as we got there. Water was brought to us as soon as we sat down.  Our waiter was excellent, very attentive.\nWe had the Carne De Fuego and the Pollo Margarita.  Both meals were great.  Food was well prepared and hot.\nThought the place, service and food were very good and would definitely go back."
"1","Where do we begin?   People have been telling us about the Old Town Tortilla Factory.  We were in Scottsdale and hungry and decided to try it out.   Had we stopped with just appetizers this review might be different. \nWe were greeted in a fairly empty restaurant by Jason - who claimed he was pulling double duty in the bar - which we found out later was a lie.  Oh sure - he WAS IN the bar, but not behind it working.\nWe ordered the chorizo queso as an appetizer and a couple of margaritas.   The margaritas come in those little plastic shakers, which have lose tops.  The appetizer was great and delish. The margaritas were weak with little or no alcohol.   I ended up ordering 3 and still didn't feel any buzz.  Jason never seemed around for an empty restaurant and when we walked in...the outside bar looked fairly empty...hmmmm\nWhen Jason finally arrived back to take our order, I proceeded to self-pour my margarita and the top fell off the shaker, pouring a margarita all over the table.  Jason didn't flinch.  All he said was that happens all the time and promptly noted that they don't give away free drink replacements when it happens.   So they know tops fall off, they still continue to use such tops for their weak drinks, and won't replace them.   Hmmm...\nWe were stunned.  We then discuss our orders with a drink spilled on the table.  I was vacillating between the sea bass and the snapper.  He said how good the snapper was so I ordered it.  Less than 5 seconds after I ordered, my lady said \""Try the sea bass it looked better\"" so we wait for Jason to return.  No Jason.  We call another waitress to find Jason (and find our own bus boy to clean the spilled rink on the table.).  When Jason returns, I tell him to change my order - he says \""Too late the chef already started it.\""  Again - we are stunned.  I can't change my order moments after I order it?  We are still trying to figuring out why he disappears in a nearly dead restaurant, so I say, \""I guess I'll have to stick with the snapper for your sake - I hope its good.\"" \nOur entrees finally arrive, and the snapper is unremarkable.  It's a whole fish - head and tail.  Snapper is a very bony fish so every bite is filled with bones. It's like a streamed fish.  No sauce and nothing to make it remarkable.  I take about three bony bites and then just stop.  Jason never came by during the meal to check on us.  He comes back about 15-20 later, never notices I didn't eat his shitty recommendation of fish but want to push more weak drinks, in flawed containers that fall apart onto us.  We refuse.  We get the check.  All the while through dinner, I stare at a stack of dirty plates from my appetizer of chorizo and empty spill glasses that never got picked up!\nNow I will digress.  We both worked for tips as kids, through high school and college.  TIPs are a privilege and not a right.  I don't think restaurant workers automatically deserve TIPs.  One earn TIPS.  My lady always feels bad not leaving a tip.  I never feel bad.  TIPs are about the hustle and making a client happy.  I saw none of this in Jason.   After much discussing with my lady - I left Jason ZERO tip.  Not even a penny.  I thought he sucked.  I thought his recommendation sucked.  I thought he was uncaring.  I thought his lack of empathy with a spilled drink, cleaning it up (He did tell us he was \""working\"" the bar...didn't he??) sucked.  I left him nothing and didn't feel bad about it at all.  I thought he was worthless and lazy.  \nWe get up and walk out of the restaurant.  We walk out the front door into the courtyard where the bar is and we see Jason.   Sure- Jason was in the bar....SITTING ON A BAR STOOL WATCHING A FOOTBALL GAME while some blonde girl was behind the bar, tending it.  My lady just smiled at me and says, \""For once I agree with you and can't wait until you tell the world about this on Yelp.\""  \nSuggestions to the restaurant:\n1) Where is your manager?  No one is walking the restaurant asking how everyone and everything is?  You allow your associates to sit in the bar and watch a football game?  My drink wasn't cleaned up nor was my food order corrected because some assclown is sitting on a bar stool watching a football game???\n2) Don't serve drinks in shitty plastic shakers that fall apart.  Don't tell patrons you know this and still continue to do it.   Replace your weak drinks when spills happen since it's your own damn fault.\n3) Fire Jason.  Look up worthless and lazy in the dictionary and you'll see his picture.  There's a reason people like him make no money in the restaurant business and he is a piss-poor reflection of what your restaurant could be.  For all we know, maybe he was the manager or part of the owners family which is why his ineptitude is accepted. \n4) For patrons?  Don't go to this place.  Around the corner on the other side of Scottsdale is a very old gem named Los Olivos.  Go there.  Your experience will be much better."
"5","Dr. Garrett at SCP is in 1 word - AMAZING!!\n\nWhen I was on the hunt for a pediatrician for Baby C while I was still pregnant, I asked a few of my fellow colleagues where they take/have taken their kids.  A lot of them mentioned SCP (both the Shea and Osborn locations).  I gave them a call and let them know I was still pregnant, but was looking for a ped for my son when he arrived.  I had questions - they happily answered!  I had a feeling this was going to be a good match.\n\nSo fast forward to Baby C's birth.  I knew from the moment I learned I was pregnant that I wanted to breastfeed.  Our first official day at the birthing suites, in the couplet rooms, on the night shift..I had a nurse from HELL.  From manhandling me and Baby C, to belittling my efforts and pushing formula.  At 6am, I snapped.  I literally lost my shit and went a little nuts, crying hysterically and hyperventilating after the Demon Nurse did her final check on us and got her last rude comment in before she left.  Dr. Garrett walked in a minute later.  She calmed me down, told me that my body knew what to do (and I needed to trust that and myself), and then proceeded to go report the nurse to the nursing supervisor.  From that moment - I knew Dr. Garrett had not only Baby C's best interest but mine (and my parenting plan/wishes) as well.  A match made in baby heaven!\n\nNow, unfortunately Baby C suffers from a few respiratory ailments.  The handful of times I've taken him in, Dr. Garrett is pleased with how my treatment has gone thus far (giving breathing treatments, etc) and she basically trusts my judgment (i have my own resp issues, so I know the drill).  Baby C has dodged the hospital admission bullet a few times - because we can get a handle on his breathing and she knows that I'm on the ball with his treatment.  But she knows that if I bring him in to be seen, there's a problem.  \n\nOH - She's also not one of those Drs that will just throw antibiotics at the problem.  Not if antibiotics aren't truly warranted.  She in fact isn't the kinda Dr to prescribe meds just to appease the patients parents.  I know a few parents like that...demanding antibiotics for a basic virus that antibiotics wont do squat for (but help with the problem of antibiotic resistant super-bugs).   \n\nOh and the office staff - from the front desk to the nurses are wonderful too!.  OH and Mary Beth is an excellent NP!!  We've seen her a few times when we couldn't get in to see Dr. Garrett. \n\nI can and will shout it from the mountain tops - I love this Peds Office and Dr. Garrett!!  :D"
"2","I danced my ass off one night here!  Had a blast, but thank god I didn't have to pay for the drinks!  Somehow we got passed the cover at the door too.  The decor is really posh/random.  I don't remember much, but I know it didn't suck BUT I'm pretty sure that's because the people I was with were awesome... not the place."
"5","Its been a few years since I've been, but damn this pizza was good!. I remember it gets really hot (in the summer) and noisy on weekend nights. Otherwise, a wonderful place to go with friends, share a bottle, eat some tasty pizza, and go home happy. Clearly a must-try."
"4","Incredible pizza, great ambiance and terrific service. \n\nWe really enjoyed this Old Town spot next to the Poisoned Pen Bookstore. We split an Emiliana salad at the recommendation of the owner followed by an Italian Sausage and mushroom pizza. Both were excellent as was the selection of wines. \n\nI thought I'd order a Sangiovese as it was lunch, and I wanted something light. They brought out 3 wines to try and we ended up going with a Tuscan Cabernet blend which was terrific. \n\nThis place makes the list of \""spots to go back to\"" in Scottsdale! Great service, great food and really nice ambiance!"
"2","I took a date here as we both heard good things about it and both of us were craving wine and pizza. We ordered the Marcello (mozzarella, garlic, tomatoes, Parmesan) and the Vegetariana (mozzarella, provolone, caramelized onions and roasted red peppers). We both agreed that the pizzas were just okay, nothing great. It didn't have a lot of flavor and not enough toppings. It wouldn't come close to my top ten pizza places in the city. The restaurant was cool as there were a lot of places to sit outside as well as in. The wine selection was pretty decent as well. \n\nNot a fan of the food but maybe I went on an off night. I plan on giving it another shot and possibly order a different pizza with more toppings."
"4","very nice staff, great wine selection, and incredible food.\n\nhave been going there for 5 years, have had one bad experience out of 40."
"5","Not only is the food delicious but the service was amazing! We ordered the meat and cheese platter with a caprese salad. It was the perfect combination for a hot night. We took our time, enjoyed the food and we never felt rushed. Now it's your turn!"
"5","I love staying here.  First off, I agree with one of the other reviewers, request a poolside room and you can sit outside looking at the palms and the pool on an adirondack chair.\n\nThe staff is really friendly, and seem to really enjoy their jobs.  The rooms are spacious, clean, and comfy.  The free wi-fi is pretty fast and I've gotten a strong connection every time.\n\nThings that I love about this Holiday:\n\n-Shuttle to and from the airport, and anywhere within a 3 mile radius of the hotel\n-HAPPY HOUR!  2 types of beer and 2 types of wine, all free, for 2 hours, plus snacks.  In the summer they ramp up the snack selection and have taquitos and other more substantial food.\n-Continential breakfast: it is good, plenty of selection, they let you take as much food as you want back to your room.\n-If you forgot a toiletry, they give you one for free\n-A couple of PCs in the lobby in case you need to get online and don't have your own\n-A cute little book exchange.  They have a shelf full of used books, the kind you read on a plane like murder mysteries, with a \""take one leave one\"" sign.  I love the little touches.\n-Free paper every day\n\nI just feel welcomed every time I come here, and will never stay anywhere else when I am in Scottsdale."
"5","First off !\nCalvin is awesome! First time staying here and it was amazing. My family and I were on the first floor. Room 140 and 160. The managers were so professional and accommodating. The breakfast was great, the jacuzzi /pool was so nice and clean. The rooms were comfortable and super cozy. I got Lolo's next door, used the work out center and drank coffee /tea all week. The little chips & wine happy hour was a nice touch. I think I will consider this hotel chain from now on when I travel. The staff \nmembers make the establishment shine. Being a former hotel manager and from the hospitality industry, I can say, they are on the same level+ with some of the best hotels. (Dream hotel NYC & and the Intercontinental Los Angeles.)\nThanks ladies and gents!\nRick Aleandre"
"3","Five stars for the low-slung bar for and manned by midg--ahem, I mean, little people.  But that in itself is not the entirety of the place.  If there's any place in Scottsdale that screams Klassy, this would be it. \n\nGiligin's tugs at the senses like a trashy but fun cousin would, whether it's the sticky floors, the tacky wheel of misfortune, the swing hanging randomly in the bar, the refrigerated cases behind the bar like you're at a liquor store or the nightly promotion gimmicks - goldfish races, anyone?  They have a menu, but I will admit I'm scared to try the food here.\n\nWe came here a couple of weeks ago in the hoopla that was FBR Super Bowl weekend and after ditching all places on Scottsdale Road, we ended up here.  We had a blast before and after the $1 jello shots, and I even got some rad photos with the Captain Morgan's guy.  Later, I found myself walking around with a giant Coors Light, while being soundly defeated by a visiting Wisconsinite girl in a rousing game of beanbag toss. Midwestern bar games were never my thing."
"3","Cool place. The bartender was kind of a dick but whatever.  They have beer pong tables and a girl walks around selling $1 jello shots which I have never seen before so that was cool.  The patio was too small though so it was pretty crowded.  Fun place though.  Definitely a place you can find yourself easily shitfaced."
"5","You've got great food, no cover, stripper pole, beer pong tables, midget bar, strong drinks, fun atmosphere, no dress code, patio, food... What isn't to love about this place?"
"5","By far the BEST HAPPY HOUR in Scottsdale. I was in Scottsdale for 2 weeks for training a couple months ago and came here a few times.  The people that work here have spunk! This place has a very laid back and fun atmosphere, gives you a break from the rest of Snobsdale. The happy hour food prices and drink prices are unbeatable. I recommend this place for anyone looking for a good time and great prices."
"1","I've been to this place a few time but most recently it has gone completely down hill and beyond help.  This was never the place to go for good service but more for game and fun atmosphere.   Last few time not only has it become horrible service but rude service at that.  Specially this ugly rude girl that called herself the manager.  I order some fried zucchini off there late nite menu and after 45min it still hasn't come and when I asked about how much long she rudely said that it will come when it comes and that they only have one fryer for the whole bar.   Let's just say that will be my last time going to this establishment."
"1","I came in for the first time looking for maintenance as I was at the Giants game and was told midgets worker Vanessa the waitress was so rude to me I left after 60 seconds and will never return again.\n\nDo not go to this place it's a joke I'm so sad I wasted my Driving there.\n\nShe was so rude to me I just asked her a simple question.\n\nSave your money and try someplace else there are several options in town"
"3","Well this Walmart is a bit odd since its on an Indian Reservation. They do not sell smokes or alcohol. Apparently the greedy Indians want to make a profit on all of that stuff, so you have to go to one of their stores.  Don't they make enough profits with their giant casino just up the street? Anyway, this place stands out for the unusual greeter at one door who roams around in an elevated wheelchair. He will kill you with his kindness and even when I started going negative on him, he was very helpful and courteous and will always say \""i hope you have a great day\"". Now, the greeter on the other end is your garden variety Walmart greeter with little personality except a faint smile. The subway bread still stinks up the place, but Auntie Anne's is a good addition to the mix."
"3","I think they did a really nice job with the remodel and expansion, not long ago. It is a Walmart that doesn't feel a  like a slum."
"3","I was trapped across the street at the God awful RnR bar. I was longing to be there instead. It looked like a fun friendly place from across the road and the few bikers that crossed the road to check out RnR were good guys. I just feel odd without  a bike going there."
"4","After spending a few summers in Phoenix you learn to locate and love certain watering holes.  One of the best treats to cool off the perspiration of a long Phoenix afternoon is the date shake at Sphinx.  This place has a long history with Scottsdale and its shakes have been hydrating sweaty residents for several decades now."
"1","Disappointed because I wanted to send a gift to my Mother and Grandmother for Mother's Day.  Tried to order two gift tins of Medjool Dates on the website but unfortunately the website was not functioning properly.  No big deal, I will give them a call, which I did....  During business hours, but got an answering machine.  Left a message that I wanted to place an order.  Nobody returned the call.  I guess they already have all the business they need."
"1","Absolute worst experience I have had living in an apartment, the staff is super rude and always trying to make an extra dollar off of you any way they can, the place itself is ghetto and not kept very clean, with a dirty vagrant vibe to all of the residents. Always had the feeling like I was going to get mugged walking around outside. Please avoid this place at all costs, they try to lure you in with the promise of good deals but you will for sure pay for it in the end."
"3","This place is lovely, and quite pleasant and relaxing too.  It is a lush kind of venue with greenery surrounding the outside; you will forget you are even in a dessert!   The best part of this place are the different areas to sit.  Inside they offer rooms overlooking the \""backyard\"", wine room, and \""living room\"".  For people watchers, steal an outside table by the entrance.  My favorite seating is the outdoor tables with the rustic metal couches; private and shaded by the over-hanging trees.  Clientele here are the Nordstrom Close-To-The-Hill women; and I mean WOMEN.  Apparently men do not eat here, as the restaurant was full of tables upon tables of women; not even one gay.  Strange.  So if you're looking for a sugar mammy with a simple palette dig in.  \n\nWhich leads me to my next comment; the menu.  For such an artistic place, I am disappointed it offers such a generic mainstream menu.  I'm referring the Strawberry Chicken Salad with almond slices and the Oriental Chicken Salad with crispy noddles and julienned red peppers.  I have a feeling the clientele here dictates the type of food they produce.  I had ordered their Wild Mushroom, Spinach, and Leek Quiche which was delightful.  It was not over-worked or preciously \""perfected\""; infact, I appreciated the crunchy bits of cheese that had been baked on the metal pan and its un-uniformed the pastry shell, which was crispy and light.  A warning for Bloody Mary fans, you will have to settle for champagne cocktails or pitchers of either red or white sangria, as they do not serve hard liquor; not too much of a sacrifice. \n\nOverall a very safe restaurant to go for breakfast or lunch.  Decor and service was great, just the menu was not my style.  Please, just give us a little more adventure and amusement.  Check please."
"1","Three words: bland, expensive, bland. I went with a friend and she ordered a ham sandwich and I ordered crab cakes. We were both disappointed and found this place way OVERRATED. I think you pay for the atmosphere because the food is just your average lunch."
"4","what a wonderful thing our first option was crowded and my friend remembered this place. I It is a bit over my budget, but this was my birthday treat.\n\nWe tried 2 of the classic things they have. I had the fresh mushroom with goat cheese and keel and my friend had the chicken crepe. I found more taste and flavor on the first one, but in general both were really good. We finished with one of their deserts. The raspberry chocolate cake mmmmm or something like that. SHARE IT!! to eat one alone is too sinful.\n\nThe place has a nice decoration and makes you feel very comfortable. Great to surprise a girl or a boy :)."
"3","Sometimes when I'm at work and I get overloaded, I go into old-people f*#k mode, ie; any way to get the job done.\n\nI suspect that's how the chef functions at AF when the place is packed to the gunwales because my herb roasted chicken sandwich, a long standing favorite of mine became my least favorite...all in the space of one visit.\n\nI've rarely had a bad meal here, but Saturday, the place hosted every old woman's birthday, baby shower, and all-around chick event. I think the kitchen panicked and started throwing shit on plates like monkeys were ruling the kitchen.\n\nAnyway, it wasn't good.\nCome here when it's not so packed and you don't have to listen to the gay couple next to you bragging about their trip to Barbados and how they frolicked nude on the beach.\nThe image of swinging dicks combined with a bad sandwich was over the top.\nGlad I have a Xanax prescription."
"3","My mom and I have gone here for years to celebrate Mother's Day. I want to say I ADORE the atmosphere of Arcadia Farms. I want to live there. However, the last couple times we have gone, the food has been lacking. The chicken sandwich was bland, everything needed salt and the crab and avocado tower was not only bland and flavorless but extremely watery. We didn't finish it. Strawberry shortcake was delicious. We have decided to only go back for the ambiance and will have wine and cheese. Probably won't bother ordering additional food.  I am giving 3 stars instead of 2 due to the atmosphere."
"2","I would have to give this place a 2.5 stars. First off service is extremely slow & that us defiantly this places major down fall .I went here with a girlfriend and her brand new baby and my 2 yr old daughter it took them 2.5 hrs to get us out of there ? Thank god our children were well behaved, it took about 10-15 min after ring seated for someone to come around and ask for our drink order. Then when we wanted to place order I wanted the turkey & Brie sandwich minus the Brie our waiter informed me that food is pre made  & I couldn't get that ? For $14.00 sandwhich I would expect a fresh one made at least so I changed my order to the chicken quesadilla it was very tasty :) we waited around for our check for about an hr or so we were just chit chatting so didn't realize it had been that long but to add insult to injury my girlfriend paid cash & for her meal & never had her change brought out the server we finally flagged down and said could you bring our change and she was like of you want change ? Uh yeah I want my change so that pissed my friend off big time we were getting up to leave & the server was hovering around to get her tip very annoying because whenever we needed to be served she was no where to be found ?  The restaurant itself very cute & charming & could have a ton of potential but I would rather go elsewhere for the price & service. Overall food was just ok nothing special. I did check out the little market across street to get daughter a cookie very friendly staff & cookie was delicious :)"
"4","whoa man....i thought these types of places were way over priced for \""organic\"" food....thus i never go there (or sprouts or whole foods or anywhere else that makes me feel bad for not eating orgainic and charging me double/triple for the same bananas that come from chile). but man, this place rocks. we got one of their salespapers in the mail this week, and all the produce is so much cheaper. and it looks fresher than my neighborly fry's next door. and cage free eggs were cheaper too....holy toledo. i wouldn't buy my canned goods here, but from now on, sunflower is THE place for us when it comes to veggies and fruits!!!"
"5","Man, this store is bad ass! If I lived in the area, this is where I would be shopping!"
"4","Sunflower is my favorite grocery store, despite its pricey side. I always find great produce here, and the Boar's Head deli stock is an incentive to skip cooking, go directly to sandwich, and they feed my raging kombucha addiction.\n\nSide note: they have a generous gluten-free selection. My rm has been gluten-free for years, it's nice to have a place where we can both grab groceries without having to make special trips."
"5","You will have to pay a lot to hang here, but if you are in Scottsdale, definitely one of the top places to stay!  The pool is great, and the constant ice water, great food service is great.  Its near impossible to get a room that has a great mountain view and even if you do you are quite a ways away from the pool.  The casitas close to the pool are really  nice, like little condos, and most have nice sliding doors out to the pool area.  The grounds are gorgeous and the place really is worth it.  Be sure and use the hotel's car service to take you up to the hiking trail.  Great Scottsdale Haven."
"4","My husband and I stayed here over the holidays as we were visiting family and needed a private retreat to escape to at the end of the day...This place is such the decadence!  Of course there's a price for that but sometimes you just got to treat yourself.  It was also my birthday that week and my husband had made mention of it when booking our reservations..  We arrived about 1:00 in the afternoon..just driving up through the gates are a treat in itself..beautiful landscaping and there is the hotel set up against Camelback Mountain.   You have to stop at a guard who asks you if your checking in and you tell him your name and are let thru.  We decided to do self parking instead of valet because paying 39 dollars a day is not how I want to spend the enormous amount of money I knew I'd be spending on better things like the spa, restaurants, drinks.\nThe lobby is so spacious with marble floors, fountain and lots of windows to view the scenery.  Check in was very fast..the guard must let the front desk know your here as they as our room keys were all ready to go!  When we got to our room I was so happy on how big and modern the decor was..  It's a 600 sq, foot room with a double sided sliding glass which opens to this huge balcony with two chairs, a table and a long lounge chair..  We had got the highest floor (4th) with a pool view..ask for that if you ever go as it's the premium view..\nThere was a bottle of champagne chilling on ice with two glasses (compliments of the hotel) for my birthday and a card welcoming us.  The bathrooms are all done in marble with a sunken tub, full sized tolietries from their spa (Eucalyptus/grapefruit) and two big fluffy robes hanging up next to the tub.  A CD was playing some classical music, I guess to set the mood for the elegance and I'll tell you, I did not want to leave the room EVER!  \nWe ate a few times at \""The Terrace\"" which you had a choice of indoor or outdoor dining.  great food and excellent service.. The only thing I didn't enjoy was the many families with a lot of kids who dined there..very noisy at times..but then my husband and I are child free by choice so I guess we get a little grumpy when we are around misbehaving kids.  They also have a lounge and at night you can sit out on a high overlook, with fire pits for a chilly Arizona night and have some very tasty cocktails..  We also used the spa one day, my husband had a massage and I just used their sauna, steam room, whirlpool and the meditation garden sipping some herbal teas..I loved it!  They have over 5 pools scattered around the place, at night we went swimming and then used their enormous hot tub!  I can't wait to go back to this place..it's worth the extra money to be treated well, and to have a relaxing time..."
"4","We've always been given huge suites with huge balconies.  I think it is because my SO's is distantly related to one of the most famous politicians in Arizona and shares his last name. They alway remember our name and as soon as they see us coming the valets get our car immediately.  I think I want to move to the Phoenix area because that is how we get treated every in the area."
"5","You can find me in Scottsdale in July- that's how much I love this place! The Phoenician is one of my favorite places to stay in the whole world or at least on the West Coast.  Every time a 3 day weekend rolls around, Labor day, 4th of July, you get the idea- I'm so at the Phoenician. \nIt goes a little like this:\n7am - wake up in my kick ass room and enjoy how huge it is. Then have coffee and take a look at how absolutely beautiful Camelback is.\n8am- have huevos rancheros for breakfast- they make great mexican food.\n9am- walk over to the mother of pearl pool and grab my chair to layout on until about 1pm and i'm starting to look nice and toasty.\n1pm- order steak salad at the pool- absolutely my favorite lunch ever!\n2pm- take a shower and then make my way to the spa until about 4pm\n4pm- make my room so cold and enjoy the ac and then take a nap:)\n6pm- wake up and get ready for dinner\n8pm- take a look at camelback and completely enjoy the surroundings and my warm evening.\n*A huge plus and probably why I continue to have the same vacation over and over, is everyone on staff is great and happy to help.  I've never felt that they are pretentious or rude. And so I keep coming back for my get- away- weekends:)"
"2","Just got back from a stay at the Phoenician.   Although the resort was beautiful, I was thoroughly disappointed in their service and won't return. I don't take a lot of vacations but do like to stay at a top notch place when I do go. For me, the service is by far the most important aspect on my trips and I found the staff at the Phoenician lacking in that respect. We were given a mountain view room. Typically, when I hear a hotel advertise mountain versus pool view rooms, it's not a big deal to me (in fact, I'd prefer the mountain except if I'm in a coastal hotel with a view of the ocean). In this case though, what they mean by mountain is opening your shade and being right next to a mountain (so close you can tell the bugs on the bushes). So essentially, you don't really have a view. That wasn't the greatest, but the bigger problem was I had no phone reception on half of the room and the other half I was only able to get one bar (clearly a result of being right next to a mountain). We went to the NCAA basketball game on our first day in town so we weren't in the room much. The next morning, I went down to use the fitness facility and found it to be sub-par for a hotel of the level of the Phoenician (needed a serious refresh...they have a bunch of antiquated machines and spin bikes). I asked the concierge if she knew of a track nearby (figured I'd just go for a jog instead since I didn't like the fitness center). She had some maps laid out for jogs on the complex but I informed her that running on asphalt takes its toll on my knees and that I really needed a track. I asked if there was a college nearby and she directed me to ASU, but gave me bad directions (had me turn right on Camelback and it should have been left). I drove for about 35 minutes and never came across the first street that I was supposed to turn on (Scottsdale Blvd). So that wasted over an hour of my time for nothing. As I kept having calls drop off on my phone, I became more annoyed with the situation and by Saturday morning complained to the front desk. The snooty clerk replied..\""well sir, we can't do anything about the way the hotel is constructed\"". I thought to myself, so what are you saying?...your customers have to suck it up and deal with it? I would think a more professional clerk would have apologized for the inconvenience and immediately look to switch my room (instead of me telling the clerk that this wouldn't do). So I had the room switched but it wasn't available yet (it was 7am). He said I would receive a call informing me when the room was ready. By 12:30, we hadn't received a call and had to leave for the game so I called the front desk. The clerk said to leave our packed luggage on the bed and it would be moved for us to the new room by the time we got back. We arrived back at the hotel at 5. The new room was ready but the luggage hadn't been moved (they said they would take care of it right away). So we went to the bar for a little over an hour. We got back to the room...still no luggage. I called back to the desk and the clerk apologized and said it would be done right way). After another hour and still no luggage, I went to the desk and complained (we had 8 o'clock dinner reservations at a restaurant away from the hotel and needed to change clothes). We finally received our luggage just before 7:30 and needless to say didn't really have time to freshen up a bit before dinner (actually just got to the restaurant at 8). Although the front desk manager apologized the next day, it really didn't matter to me at that point. She asked what she could do to make me happy and offered to comp a massage or a free meal. I just asked if it was possible to get an \""uneventful\"" day from her staff (which was really all I wanted all along). She had a look on her face like she didn't even know how to respond to that request (as though that might be asking the impossible). I mentioned that I really didn't think I was asking too much to have our luggage delivered and perhaps her staff could have at least made sure we had some ice (they don't have ice machines so we had to call room service for ice). She was surprised by the ice comment and questioned whether we had had turn down service (apparently the maids are supposed to deliver ice every night). I informed her we never received ice in the 3 nights we had been there and I had to call for it (and of course, tip their room service which I thought was bogus). She did end up comping our lunch but honestly it just didn't matter. I can't stand it when a 5 star hotel provides shoddy service like this. There are plenty of deals out there especially with the economy being in the shape it's in (even for 5 star hotels). My wife actually chose the hotel (I was pushing for the Four Seasons). The last day at the hotel was our 25th wedding anniversary, but I was just too annoyed to really enjoy it. Too bad the staff doesn't realize they ruin people's stays when they can't deliver a quality experience."
"5","This pertains to the golf course.  Played here last week and thoroughly enjoyed it course.  This is a beautiful golf course.  Great shape, tremendous scenery with Camelback mountain in many of the backdrops for tee shots, lots of variety.  You never feel like you are seeing the same hole.  I have played about a dozen different courses in the Scottsdale area and for me this was the nicest I have played."
"2","The Phoenician is a dated property and in need of a facelift.  Spend your money elsewhere!"
"5","A wonderful experience as usual.  The only hiccup was when a bartender was rude to us, but the a manager (Matthew) swooped in and made sure we were completely happy!  We love the Phoenician!"
"4","The concierge staff here is top notch.  Always willing to help you with whatever they can.  Only drawback was they could not order flowers or balloons for room delivery for me unless I gave them my credit card info.  They could not just charge it to our room?  I found that a bit irritating, but their service otherwise was impeccable.  \n\nLove the Valet staff.  Traveling alone with baby can be challenging.  These guys were on it and so helpful.  \n\nBaby & kids pool area is great!  It is set off away from the \""adult\"" pool lounging area which I find nice.  They have an open space for Croquet which is fun to play anytime.  \n\nGrille service was interesting.  For brunch of 5 we seemed to get top notch service.  But it seemed the smaller the party we were, the worst service we got.  Really."
"5","Let me start by saying that i am a die hard MAC fan... only ever used MAC and am a total snob about it! BUT now that i have basically every shade of their lipgloss and lipstick- i thought it was time to venture out of my little box.\nI got a MUA named Julian and he was AhhhhhMazzzinngggg! We spent about an hour just playing with different makeup and he created a whole new look for me PLUS we made it budget friendly which was an added bonus! Even the other MUA's were coming over to watch him work his magic on me! I had so much fun AND got a new look! I already set up another time to go in and see him for another mini makeover!"
"5","I will never take my vehicles anywhere else! This is the best, most honest and great Company. Thanks!!!!!"
"4","I was in Old Town for an appointment and walked by Bischoff's. I remembered that I wanted to check them out to see if they had a particular hot sauce.  I had only been in one other time several years ago, and had forgotten what a unique store it was.  Because I had some time to kill, I not only looked at the hot sauces, but also all their other \""stuff\"".  And what stuff it is - everything from southwestern  foods, baskets, pottery, clothes, t-shirts, travel books, cookbooks, hats, tourist souvenirs - you name it, they have it.  \n\nIt kind of reminds me of the old general stores that still exist in small towns - a little of everything, but with a southwest flavor.  Crowded, narrow aisles, no rhyme or reason where they stock things - but still fun to look through.\n\nI never did find the particular hot sauce I was looking for, but I did manage to find three others that I took home to try. And I'll be back, if for nothing else  just to look through their assorted merchandise for that elusive  touristy gift."
"4","We went for a friends birthday party. I like the intimate setting. I'm usually not a comedy fan, but I laughed quite a bit at 3 out of the 4 comedians. There was a Fetish Ball going on next door, which confused me at first b/c I didn't understand why leather masks and nipple clamps were the dress code for a comedy club, but once I saw the little neon \""Comedy Spot\"" sign, I figured it out. Overall its a great place to go on a  weekend. Assless chaps optional."
"1","Just wanted to agree fully with Bill (the other reviewer) for his review regarding the event 'Beat the Heat Winterfest'.  I don't understand why this event wasn't canceled when it was so hot with no AC at the facility.  An incredibly disappointment."
"5","I recently got married at the Venue. First of, the staff was incredible. Deanna, who was the event coordinator, was patient, understanding, and willing to help me at each stage of the preparation. She was there reminding me of things I had to get done, vendors I still needed, etc. When it was time for the big day, she was there directing people, so that all I had to do, was show up and enjoy my very special day. Now, the place was fabulous. It was elegant and classy. All of our guests raved about how awesome the food was, how elegant it was, and how nicely the entire event was organized. From the appetizers to the cake, everything was perfect. My husband and I both are so thankful to them for making our special day so much less stressful and much more enjoyable. I definitely recommend them. Trust me, not only will you love the place, but your guests will be left impressed."
"5","Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.  What a great find!  Next husband I have, is getting a wedding band from this store.  Very manly looking designs, beautiful, handsome, high quality.  I'd be very proud to have a band from here on my next dude's finger.  Stop by if you can.  Tucked into the inner depths of Fashion Square Mall.  Be sure to take a map and water and a flare gun."
"3","At first glance, this store looks like a tourist trap as it is in old town and they are selling Mexican trinkets. However, I can't say with absolute certainty, the prices seemed to be pretty decent.  I bought a colorful straw sombrero for 5 dollars.  I saw some other items that seemed to be priced right.\n\nYou can find all your Mexican things to make for a fantastic fiesta.  Or you can find pieces to decorate your home with in this store -- from the colorful Dia de Muertos Masks to the plates and cups to the garden pieces.  \n\nI did not find the ladies in the store to be friendly at all.  But the store is neat and you will be happy, I am sure, with the HUGE selection of trinkets."
"5","Wow this place is awesome!!! Cool people and there's a hot lady that works in there. Yup. Go do some business at Hilands Cigars if you like good deals, and chilling!"
"2","Not so much for me . Last years participants was not impressive. I would rather spend more money and go to one of the bigger events like devoured , feast on the streets , or taste of biltmore. My friends that go like it because its family friendly so i can see that point of view , it is family friendly and a nice way to kick off the summer."
"5","The Tech just left, I will post up a few other reviews because the service and the workmanship have always been great. I have purchased THREE units from them and had service done 2 times. Well, this call was because I was unsure if the unit was working right. They came right out, spent over a hour making sure all the readings were correct and I even programmed the thermostat (Which made a huge difference).\n\nTHANKS SCOTTSDALE AIR!"
"1","We have used Scottsdale Air several times in the past.  The last time was definitely the last time.  The technician who came out was RUDE, RUDE, RUDE.  He told us the problem was not fixable and that they would have to replace the system for thousands of dollars.  We called a different company for a second opinion and they said it was quite obvious what the problem was and were able to fix it in just over an hour for a few hundred dollars.  I do have to say that when we called the office to complain they were very pleasant, but it did not make up for the nasty, condescending technician.  We will never use Scottsdale Air again."
"5","Took my car in for a repair a few years ago. This time I needed some major work done and seemed to remember a great, honest experience from years ago, so I figured I would try them again. I was not disappointed. Great customer service, very fair pricing, professional, courteous...I will only consider them for all repair needs in the future. Highly recommended!"
"2","Growing up in Long Island, NY (and making frequent trips to Brooklyn & Manhattan) I have to honestly say that as far as Old Time Ice Cream Parlors go.... this leaves a lot to be desired.  However, that's not to say that this isn't a gem to be enjoyed.\n\nOld Town Scottsdale on a Sunday afternoon (as I experienced it on vacation last week) is quiet and hot.  There wasn't too much to do and the kids were getting restless.  That being said, it was only 1pm and it was lunch time.  The bright pink building can be seen from quite the distance and certainly stands out on the main road (Scottsdale Rd) in Old Town Scottsdale.  Besides, any place that's been around for 50+ years has merit with me.  \n\nOne piece of advice I'd offer is keep it simple.  A burger is an ok order, but stay away from the Reuben.  Should be simple, but somehow...outside of NY... I rarely get one that's worthy of the name.  And this was no exception.  \n\nBIG GRIPE:  No Fries???  They serve potato chips with all their sandwiches, no fries.  Don't get me wrong I like their \""Kettle Chips\"" (which aren't made there, but instead probably poured from oversized bags in the back).  But a true old time parlor should have french fries.  Ok, end of gripe.\n\nNow to the ice cream.  I won't comment on how they make it or give a review of all their flavors 'cause frankly I didn't have much.  I had a coffee shake which was quite good actually.  My mother-in-law got the '23 Skiddoo\"" that I was eyeing and she was quite happy with it...  It was dutch chocolate ice cream & turkish coffee ice cream, with coffee syrup, sliced almonds, whipped cream & a cherry.  It looked great and got a thumbs up from mom.  My wife ordered a mint chocolate chip sundae (her favorite flavor) and enjoyed it.  The kids... well, the kids are easy to please.  Just stick any ice cream in front of them with some cherries on top and they're happy.\n\nOverall it was a good stop and had fantastic, friendly service. \n\nThe attached arcade left alot to be desired, but it seamed to me to be a cheap add on to a well established parlor."
"4","Great old fashioned ice cream parlor!\n\nThey have a ton of toppings to create your own or special unique creations. It's a fun place and we had good service. Ice cream was great too. \n\nIt will definitely be a stop of mine next year during spring training."
"2","Disappointing and not very good."
"4","Yum City! I went here with a group of friends after having a few drinks and it was delicious. My fiance and I split the \""Baseball winner\"" which had strawberry ice cream, mint chocolate chip ice cream topped with hot fudge and melted marshmallow sauce. I thought for sure I would get the diabetes. Even though they have Family Circus cartoons, I recommend this place  for people with and without kids. If you are in old town and are looking for a sweet treat this is your place."
"1","I keep wanting to like this place.  I want to support a local business, and yet....\n\nLast year I took my two boys there after a theater performance (Greasepaint!   Excellent!), and after we placed our orders for lunch, I took out our SET game (it's a card game that does not use a traditional deck - great fun).  WIthin moments, the server was back at our table.  \""You can't do that.\""  \""What?  Play cards?  It's not gambling.\"" (Maybe I was wrong, but living here, you start to assume that an objection to something must be religion based).  \""The owners don't allow it.\""  \""They don't allow it?  It's a matching game.\""  \""No.  You'll have to put it away.\""\n\nNow.  I would understand not wanting us to sit and play cards if we'd finished eating and were just holding a table (assuming it was busy).   However, this was during the gap between ordering and eating.  I KNOW I should've just left then.  Instead, I made my kids happy and we stayed for lunch (and ice cream!).  \n\nA couple months ago I (foolishly) decided to try again.  Didn't bother with the cards this time.  The lousy thing this time was the mold on my son's bread.  They DID remove the sandwich from the bill, but eish.    \n\nI'd kind of like the \""Restaurant Impossible\"" guy to come in here and give it an overhaul.  I don't mind the nostalgia stuff, but the place does need a solid going over."
"3","If you're looking for a sweet, maybe one with some chocolate or even a big sundae - this is your place. Nice old-fashioned ice cream shop located in old town. This place still has the retro pink vibe and decoration going on inside. \n\nMy friend and I came here when we were looking to splurge with the buster brownie sundae. BOY is It sweet but worth it! Sugar Bowl also serves food, which I was unaware of but probably wouldn't order. Service is friendly."
"5","I went here yesterday to purchase a bag.  After searching the internet for styles that I like, I came in armed with the names of about 10 bags.  Stacy was so awesome, she took each and every bag I wrote down for me to try on.  She knew that this was my first LV purchase and she made the \""experience\"" so nice.  I wish buying something was always this pleasant.  I will be back to round off the purchase with a new wallet, with no money to put in there, since I spent it all in the store."
"3","Took in some Los Olivos after a ballgame at Scottsdale Stadium.  We were referred there as \""the best Mexican around.\"" I sure hope not.\n\nIt actually wasn't bad - but hardly the best. The chicken in the taco was a little plain, and the enchilada sauce was \""meh.\"" The server was sweet, but didn't get my order straight (ordered a beef enchi, but got a chicken one).\n\nExtra points for cool decor, excellent margaritas and a bomb fried ice cream dessert. 3.25 stars."
"3","2.75/5 underwhelming. \n\ni'm generally not a fan of mexican food, so this may be an unfair review, but oh well.\n\nwhenever i think of mexican, i think of bold flavors, hearty, tender meats and sauces and creams and yum! this food was meh. nothing particularly great, it could have been wrapped in foil and i could have probably gotten it off a cart somewhere.\n\ni think there's also something to be said when proportions are off. there was a lot of food, but i also got this huge tortilla bowl full of sour cream...just unnecessary. also, if the food needs that much, i think that speaks poorly to the quality of the steak fajita i ordered.\n\noverall, the food wasn't very memorable, which was reflective of a fairly boring menu as well."
"3","While waiting to be seated at this neat Old Town location, I was reading the notes left by patrons. There were several that stated things like the best Mexican food in Phoenix, Best Mexican food ever. The food is good, not the best I ever had, I would rate it in the top ten Mexican places I have eaten at. I had the pork steak and it was done very good, moist juicy, with a really nice spice rub on it. Lots of food for the price. Salsa Fresca, Beans, Rice and tortilla. House Margarita was just so so. I would go back and I would recommend if you are in the Phoenix Metro area. They don't do separate checks, which sucks if you need an individual receipt for expense accounts."
"2","Supposedly the oldest Mexican restaurant in the area, we were directed here by our concierge.  The place has a kitchy, almost 80's feel, but it needs some updating.   The menu is a bit too \""American\"" for me; if you expect a truly authentic experience, this is not the place.  I think they get a lot of tourists here, who are used to the more Americanized dishes.  \n\nTo start, the salsa is extremely tasty - very fresh - although the chips seemed \""bag\"" quality.  After that, it was all downhill.  Two stars is a gift - it's closer to 1 star.  For lunch, we had the machaca - dry, shredded beef with peppers and tomatoes, and a combo plate of chile relleno and a corn tamale.  The plates look like a disaster when served; sauce everywhere, very disorganized.  The plates came out so hot they must have been microwaved - not a good sign at a respectable restaurant.  Too much sauce, also a sign of laziness and lack of attention to detail.  The rice was not great - not made fresh, and also crisp on top from the microwave (or taken from yesterday's rice pot).  The refried beans were a flavorless mash of canned beans; avoid.  The machaca shredded meat itself was somewhat flavorful, but again it appeared that they make it day(s) earlier and then re-heat it after slapping it on a plate.  Not authentic. The flour tortilla was huge and actually the best thing I tasted, other than the salsa.  Americanized, large plates of re-heated slop.  My advice - find a REAL Mexican restaurant, and stay away from this joint."
"4","AWESOME chips and salsa! I ordered the Carne Asada steak and it was cooked perfectly! Their double Cadillac margaritas are AMAZING!"
"3","Solid Mexican food at a reasonable price.  I had chicken enchiladas and they came with a ton of rice and beans.  Quick refills on the chips and salsa.  The service at the bar was good and I need to get back to this place more often when I'm in Old Town."
"1","I went there last night with a large party (10). You would think they would see a larger group and be excited and or a least kind. However everyone was pretty short and rude. We decided to stay and try out the food, even the the table was messy and the menus were greasy. All of which should have been warning signs of what was to come. What we received should not be called Mexican food. We had hot plates but cold rice and lukewarm food. When we informed our waitress of the issue she stated she would get us more rice which she did. However she didn't take the plate back, she provided us a plate to put the cold rice AFTER we had asked for the plate in which to do that. I personally ordered the Carne with an Enchilada and it was the WORSE enchilada I've ever had. I've made better ones using canned chile. The steak tasted like rubber and was very chewy. There was 0 consistency with the food seeing as though 3 people ordered the same meal and none looked or tasted the same. I live in Phx now and i was hoping to show my family a decent spot for some Mexican food. I was extremely disappointed in this place and will never go to it again nor will I recommend it. If you're thinking of coming here just go to chipotle or even Taco Bell, it will be cleaner and the food will be done with pride."
"1","We used to be occasional happy customers, for probably the past 20 years or so, but had not been to Los Olivos for quite some time. Thought we would try it again.  We have been there in the past, this time of year, when you had to wait for a table. The place was not busy. What a disappointing dining experience this was. Upon entering we were rudely asked if we wanted the bar, or a table.....by someone I assume was part of the family. He looked like he was dressed to go work out at the gym. I asked for a table. We followed him to the dining room where he threw 2  menus on the table and left.\nOur server...an older woman that I'm sure has been there for many years....arrived, and asked if we wanted anything to drink. I ordered soda. My Hubby ordered a beer. She said someone would bring chips, salsa, water, and soda.  That person, the 'bus girl', I guess....was so stone faced and unfriendly...and practically grunted, when we said 'thank you'. No smile. Nothing. Just her demeanor screamed that she did not enjoy her job, and would gladly be anywhere else.\nThe server returned with the beer. I ordered chicken chimi, with green sauce...rice and beans. Hubby asked for ground beef chimi, with red sauce....rice and beans.\nWe finished the chips before the meal arrived. No one asked if we wanted more chips. Again, we would have paid extra for more chips. Hubby finally got the server's attention to order another beer. She forgot. He had to ask again.\nThe food arrived. The server did not bother to ask if we wanted sour cream, or guacamole....as would be common in most Mexican restaurants. Nothing. And we would have gladly paid extra for both. Do they not understand how to 'up sell'??? Same with the beer. I was driving...so Hubby would have gladly downed three of them....it they had just offered it.\nThis place needs some new wait staff, for sure. Or perhaps some real training.\nBoth of the chimichangas were dry, bland, and tasteless. Hubby was trying to be nice and just eat his without comment. Finally, I admitted that my chicken chimi was just horrible. The burrito was not fried crisp, and was tough. There was not even a sliver of onion to be found, no seasoning at all. Just ground up 'chicken mush'...with absolutely no flavor. The same with the rice. The beans had a little bit of flavor...not much. Hubby confessed his chimi was also tasteless.\nStill no offer of another drink, more chips, nothing.\nThe 'bus girl' cleared the plates away. The server came by and snatched the empty basket the chips had been in. Not a word.  No....'how was your dinner?'  Or....'can I get you anything else?'  Or...'would you care for another drink, more chips'?  She just disappeared. Finally, she brought  the check. \nTwo women standing behind the front counter were talking in Spanish, as we left.\nNeither one looked up,  acknowledged us, or bothered to say 'thanks for coming in', 'have a nice evening'....nothing. \nWe left....very disappointed. We won't go back. I don't know how they stay in business. Obviously, they just don't care about the customer anymore."
"4","The food here is typical mexican food and good, but nothing I would rave about. Nothing to complain about either. I really come here for the great location and unique building. My daughter loves sitting by the fish tank and I always seem to find a new place to get a great picture of her every time I visit. There really are quite a few very good spots for taking pictures. Service is good and this place reminds me of what Mexican places were like when I was a kid which is not a bad thing:) I'm looking forward to sitting at the little bar or in the open air lounge and having a margarita one day when I make the trip kid free."
"5","I've always had a good experience at this Starbucks. I live basically right next door so I come here a lot and usually go through the Drive Thru and I've never had any issues. The staff here is really friendly and I like friendly people. \n\nOne thing though and this has to do with the customers not with Starbucks....if you are in the drive thru line with more than 2 cars behind you...YOU'RE IN TOO DEEP...don't try and \""back out\"" of the drive thru because that is obnoxious. Also, do not PARK directly behind the drive through on a week day morning because YOU WON\""T BE ABLE TO GET OUT. Literally, some dude came out to his car one time and he was parked directly behind the super busy drive thru and laid on his horn for literally like 5 minutes. WTF do you think that's gonna do you FOOL. Sorry you made a really terrible parking choice but don't punish the rest of us."
"3","Everybody loves this place, and maybe because of all the word of mouth i was expecting something spectacular, but i was just kind of like, oh, so this is Kazimierz...ok.\n\ni was also put off by the very poor attitude of the door guy. my boyfriend took me there for valentine's day, and the door guy kept us outside and hounded me over my ID while i chattered my answers through my teeth in my dressy top. i'm not a jerk about these things, either, i know i look young and these guys are just doing their job, but he was seriously going out of his way to be crappy about it.\n\nanyway, we made it inside finally and the food was pretty good. i had a walnut/pear salad and we shared one of their pizzas. my date thought the pizza was amazing while i found it to be so-so. the live entertainment was nice, but too loud.\n\ni think i'm just such a die-hard fan of postino's in phoenix that with my first impression being the door guy i never gave it a fair chance. but still, i'll pick Postino's over this place any day."
"4","Most of the time the music is good, like when Dennis Rowland is there. Occasionally it sounds like the type of jazz a 56 year old white lady who drives a Chrysler Sebring would listen to. Getting wine recommendations is a crapshoot-- the bartenders always recommend good wines but the servers are fairly inconsistent. \n\nOne thing you can always count on is some group of douchebags sitting right in front of the band and having social hour. Hey morons, STFU or sit in the back!"
"4","I think my favorite part about this place is the hidden entrance.  I felt like I was entering a secret speakeasy.  Inside I liked the fireplace and the dark lighting and the nice old bar.  To me it felt a little too open and big for a wine bar, not super intimate.  But I'm used to smaller bars in LA or NYC.  They had a huge wine list and were very helpful with recommendations.  There was a mix of ages , lots of dates and groups of girls, and everyone at the bar seemed mellow.  A nice change from the other bars in Old Town.  I am definitely adding this to my regular Scottsdale hang out spots."
"2","I've been to Kaz a few times now, and I gotta say that it's really hit or miss. It seems to be alright if you go during the week, but not so much during the weekend. It get's really busy on the weekends, which is great, but the staff is simply clueless on how to handle a busy night. \n\nUpon arriving on a Friday night, I am greeted by a man that I cannot see because it's so dark. Ok, ok, I get it, speakeasy and what have you. I still want to be able to make good eye contact with my potential server however. Anyhow, I inform him that I am the first of the five of us that are going arrive. He mentioned that it's going to be a wait for a table, and I informed him that I will wait up at the bar if he would please put our name in for a table. \n\nI get up to the bar, wherein the bartender passes me 3 times before even looking at me. He even stopped to help the couple next to me and still didn't even say hello.The couple next to me said \""Wow,  that's strange, he must not be feeling well or something tonight because he is usually so friendly...\"". The couple then assisted me by flagging him down wherein the bartender finally handed me a wine list and food menu. \n\nThe wine list is obviously extensive, and the food menu offers great options as well. Again, the bar was busy, and since the bartender was oh-so-helpful the first time around I decided to just pick a wine and go with it. I went with a cheese plate and a glass of Cotes Du Rhone, and at this point the other folks I was waiting on joined me and ordered a drink at the bar. 30 minutes later, our table was finally ready, and so we sat down. \n\nAfter finishing what we ordered at the bar, it took over an hour to get through another round, and at that point we were all over the Kaz experience. Normally we would have stayed and ate/drank more but the amount of time spent waiting on our server to come by was unacceptable. We asked for the bill, and I actually started the stopwatch on my phone. It took the server 15 minutes to go to the machine, print our bill and bring it back. Yikes."
"3","A very different place than the usual club for Scottsdale. Speakeasy atmosphere was nice. Band was really good. That blonde haired girl could sing. Service was below average. Bartenders could not keep up. Waited 30 minutes for first drink. Then every drink after that involves trying to get wait staff to see you. Restrooms were dirty. Wouldn't take much to make this a really nice place. Manager s just need to hire a few more staff and keep the bathrooms cleaner."
"2","It's not a resort. It's an apartment complex that's been turned into a motel. Also, NO air conditioning during our stay. We were here in February so outside it was a nice cool 60 but inside the room it must have been a little over 80. I asked about air conditioning and was told that there was none and that only hot air came out if you tried turning it on. Unfortunately I found this out AFTER I tried turning the air on \""cool\"" as the thermostat said. Friendly staff but the warm room made it very uncomfortable."
"2","Not a fan for many reasons. The toilet was dirty, the pillow cases had hair all over them, and they have a live peacock living in a small cage on the property, the cage is not big enough for him to show his beautiful feathers. There is no tv in the bedroom either. I am giving it 2 stars because it was a roof over my head, that's it!"
"4","Cowboy Ciao.  What a sickeningly cute name.  Now I wish I had more to yelp about with you than a quickie business dinner with my boss, but that's all I've got.  Still, I'm gonna review it because I doubt I'll be back.  No, no, don't read that as a criticism; given the opportunity, I'd gladly return.  However, since I so infrequently make it to Phoenix (as in \""never\""), I doubt I'll be back.\n\nNevertheless, I was happy with my brief interlude.  We didn't have reservations, but would've been happy eating at the bar.  However, in a strange twist only a weekday night would bring, the bar was full, but they had plenty of tables.  Table it is!  I ordered the mini-mushroom mix and the porkbelly sliders.  It was all very, very good.  In fact, I wanted very much to have more than the two sliders they served, but in retrospect, that's probably a good amount of fried up pig for most people.  Though the mushroom mix gets more hype, the pork won the night.\n\nService was friendly and competent, even though we didn't stick around long enough to really enjoy it.  But they called a cab for us, the cab arrived quickly and we headed back to the hotel.  In all, four solid stars.  Had we stayed longer or I had another crack at you guys, I'm sure five stars wouldn't be too far off.  \n\nBTW, thanks to ex-Phoenician, current Yelper Robert M. for pointing me in this direction."
"5","Very, very good food here.  Get the short ribs if they have them. \n\nDesserts are unbelievable as well...would be a good place to go just for that!\n\nThe short-ribs are served with a cherry BBQ sauce that is unbelievable.  I was so full, but couldn't stop eating.  I've also catered an event here before for a large group and it was awesome.  The menu can change often though based on the chef's desires/etc.\n\nI've been here twice and never left disappointed at all.  It would be a more frequented place if I lived closer to Scottsdale."
"1","This is a tough review to write.  The location was great and I'm sure the dinner would've been good too based on the other reviews.\nUnfortunately, my team didn't like anything on the pre-set menu and the restaurant didn't want to work with them on finding alternates.  \nI was a restaurant manager, so yeah, I get it - the food has already been purchased and prepped, etc.  But there were only 8 of us; how hard is it to be flexible?  How hard is it to say, \""Yes of course, but we will have to charge you separately\""?  When a group that is spending a couple thousand dollars on dinner tells you they're going to leave before you even bring the appetizers out, doesn't that concern you?  Wouldn't you send a manager over?\nIf you're Cowboy Ciao, the answer to all of these is no.  What a bummer."
"3","Awesome location, cool place....the Chopped Salad is by far the most amazing salad I have ever had in my life (but way...and I mean way to small)...If it were double the portion for the price I would probably visit more. I had a flight when I was there...it took forever (as I know flights are supposed to)...but this was ridiculous...the buffalo meat is so gross...it reminds me of when a stray dog visits my lawn...\n\nThe BBQ sauce is good....the staff is just OK. Nothing mind blowing. I think staff in a place with a pricey menu should spoil the guests a bit...Give away a free desert when you know the service and meal is just OK...this may bring your customer base back to visit just because you redeemed yourself at the end.\n\nOverall its a cool place. It fits with the downtown Scottsdale lifestyle. But stay away from the buffalo, because it will give doggy bag a whole new meaning...."
"3","The food is still fantastic, but I have to drop a star from Cowboy Ciao after my most recent visit. The group dining experience was not even close to the intimate date I had there a couple months ago. \n\nI went with a pretty big group this time (nearly 20 people), and the earliest we were able to make a reservation on a Friday night was 8:45. We met for a drink next door, and all arrived at exactly that time, but the wait was still more than 10 minutes. We had to sit at two tables that were perpendicular to each other. It was a big group, so I'm not knocking off any points for that. I am however, pretty disappointed that it was nearly 2.5 hours from the time we showed up to the time we left. \n\nThere was a different server for each table. The one who served at mine was a nice guy, but he and the kitchen felt like they were a little off their game. We ordered a few appetizers and salads with our meals. It felt like forever before those came out. \n\nThe main courses came out pretty quickly after we were done with the apps. The server screwed up, and didn't have the salmon that I ordered. So, now I was left picking at others' meals while waiting for mine. To his credit, he took 100% percent responsibility, and said it was all his fault. I know mistakes happen, especially with big groups, but against his credit with a group our size he's getting an automatic gratuity (20%). I wasn't angry enough to complain, but I can't exactly thank him for leaving someone sitting around while every one else is eating."
"2","Food was tasty. Service was SLOW.\n\nI have been back twice since this dinner, and my two-star review stands.  The food is no doubt good.  However the wait time is extremely lacking and will make me consider other establishment in the future."
"3","We ordered the mac and cheese for an appetizer, which I must say was extremely overrated. It had good texture and flavor, but I guess I expected some sort of revelation. Maybe it was too built up...\n\nAnyway, the wine list was fabulous (we had a delicious Sangiovese), and the entrees were decent. Of course, I had entree envy, as always, and drooled over my brother-in-law's order of Asian style short ribs. They were SO tender. I ordered the mushroom pan fry, which was served over polenta. All in all, it was a good dish. The sauce wasn't so creamy that I needed to be rolled out of the restaurant afterward, and it had a nice level of spiciness (hence the Southwestern edge). My husband's hamburger, however, was mediocre at best. Five Guys is better.\n\nNot sure why other reviewers were griping about the acoustics. I thought the sound level was reasonable, and apparently so did my six-month old son, who slept in his stroller next to me the whole time. Maybe these people went on a Saturday night at a peak time?? If that's the case, they should expect that anywhere, unless they're in a private room. I mean, who do they think they are - Branjolina?"
"5","The buffalo carpaccio here is amazing.  It was an enormous plate with lots of delicious raw meat, crostini and blue cheese, and a big pile of greens to make me feel healthy.\n\nThe halibut was good too.  Less memorable than the carpaccio, though.\n\nNext time I end up in the Phoenix area, I'll definitely come back."
"2","Visiting from D.C. We enjoyed a nice dinner.  Bruschetta was good.  My wife ordered the Testosterone salad and thought it was great.  Lettuce was chopped nicely and the beef strips layered on to were tender and tasty.\n\nMy swordfish was perfectly cooked and the cream sauce that came with it very nicely complimented the fish.  However, the sauce and all the vegetables on which the fish was presented were way too salty for my taste, so much so you would think the chef slipped and accidentally dumped the entire salt container into the mix.\n\nService was good.  Our waiter was friendly and knowledgeable but w e felt a bit hurried through appetizers and the main course."
"4","First, the wine list is riddiculous, but that is part of their schtick.  I  mean silly the wine list. It is bigger than a phone book, I am not kidding! Worse, the list is organzed by price rather than varietal and region. The list serves two restaurants Cowboy Ciao and Kasmierz. Cowboy Ciao is successful, because of location, setting, and the food is good. I went with l and my dad and his new wife. We had the k vintners highly rated wine for $200. I have a better memory with wines than what we ate."
"4","I went to this place with a family member upon their recommendation.  \n\nThe salad was amazing!  I forget exactly what it is called (cowboy chopped salad I think?) .  Firstly it's gorgeous (comes in rows of the ingredients which are beautiful colors; arugula, tomatoes, pepitas, dried currents, chicken, asiago cheese, and dried corn for some crunch)  Then when it gets to your table they pour on the dress (a creamy dressing with a slight basil taste to it), and it all gets mixed together.  \n\nI believe it usually comes with salmon instead of chicken but we ordered ours with chicken and it was a great fit, I highly suggest it. \n\nThe rest of the menu looked amazing too, but I'm not sure I could go there and not get the salad.  So I suggest going with multiple people, splitting the salad and then splitting another entree.  \n\nThe decor of the place could probably use a little sprucing up and it's a bit on the cheesy side.  \n\nService wise was unfortunately not the greatest experience.  It was a slow time and we had a hard time getting our bill or being asked if we needed anything else.  Thus the deduction of a star.  But I would still give it another try just for the food."
"3","My boyfriend and I decided to try out Cowboy Ciao for New Years Eve.....could have probably picked a better time.  \n\nIt was not jam packed however, the seating arrangements SUCKED.  They had tables set up to pack as many people in like sardines as they needed and any that were a party of two were screwed.  The two tops were along the window side (where it was very cold) and backed into corners with larger tables either in front or behind them.  Us and another couple were lucky enough to be stuck into such corners.  My legs were freezing the entire time and the loud table behind us were so close I could smell their food.  Not so much.  I don't know if seating is always like this, but I sure hope not!\n\nAs far as food goes it was set up in flights for the holiday's.  The food was pretty decent, not the best I've had but not the worst.  No real complaints on the taste or how things were cooked.  The only negative I have is that we were there for almost 4 hours so instead of a meal, it was more like an event.  Normally I'm not in a rush to eat and run, but that is a little too long for my personal taste.  \n\nOur waiter was friendly so that was a plus.  The interior decor was outdated and just overall well, ugly.  I did like the chandeliers though. :)  Overall, it wasn't a terrible experience but I would not go back and would not recommend it to others."
"5","one of my faves. i ALWAYS take my nyc friends here for something unique that they wouldn't expect from,,,,,phoenix??!!#% :D\n\nme, i like to graze. small bites and i can't keep away from the berkshire pork belly/ berkshire anything + pork belly = can't pass it up. truffle mac/cheese. my two faves. salads are great too"
"4","I have eaten here a few times and have had amazing food and good service. This has been my wife and I place for dinner over the past couple of years. The food, is fantastic and the service is great."
"4","I have to say I am a fan! The Stetson Chopped salad has got me hooked on this place. I literally get it go once a week! I have taken pretty much everyone I know here just to get this salad! \n\nThe Exotic Mushroom Pan Fry is also a great choice! If you still have a sweet tooth at the end of your meal definitely try the Apple Cobbler with brie cheese crema and duck fat ice cream! WOW its truly amazing and so different from any apple cobbler I've ever tasted. \n\nThe service here is always great and they are friendly and quick!"
"5","We had the Mezcal drink! Great. On to the Duck confit stuffed Rellano. OMG. The best we've ever had!"
"3","Stopped by this place after seeing it on a walk, made a night out of it for a birthday. We arrived before they got busy, so our lack of reservation wasn't an issue and we were seated immediately. Seriously impressive wine menu; their website's claim to \""wine bible\"" was justified. The bruschetta was nothing to write home about, their mushroom pan fry was tasty, but had a bit too much filler. The meat on the \""Smoke, Sugar, Shank\"" was cooked perfectly, but the beans were cold and tasteless and the whateverelse it came with wasn't memorable. The highlight of the night was definitely the desserts. The birthday cake of the night was a dark chocolate raspberry affair, and the taste was divine, even if the seeds added to an unusual texture. We sampled the ice cream trio with Orange Blossom, Chocolate Chunk, and Pickled Watermelon, and were extremely pleased. Three scoops of ice cream on a plate didn't seem enough to justify a $10 price tag, but with places like this it's to be expected. The desert wine was lovely after they filtered the cork out of my first glass. All in all a good meal, punctuated by occasional disappointment."
"2","My husband and I ate here with his parents Saturday.  We arrived at 5:45 for a 6:00 dinner reservation.  The restaurant was half empty when we placed our order.  It took 55 minutes and two requests to our waitress to get our first course.  It took another 30 for our main.  I complained to the waitress and the general manager.  Both were unapologetic stating there was nothing they could do as it was the first night of restaurant week.  Restaurant week means a trimmed down menu and I assume is meant to attract new customers.  There are too many other great restaurants in the area to give Cowboy Ciao a second chance with such an unapologetic attitude."
"3","The atmosphere of the restaurant was great.  I have to agree with some of the other posts that it seemed that we were an inconvenience to the waiter and took a long time between ordering and getting our food.  We were there a total of 3 hours,  and most of that was waiting.  The food was Ok. I had the spare rib.  It was a little dry and the portion was a bit small for the price. The best part of the meal was the bread pudding dessert, it was fantastic.  Overall,  it was not a bad place,  but not sure I would return with choices that taste better for less money."
"5","You haven't lived until you've had the Stetson Chop! It's my favorite salad in the entire world, hands down. The servers are always friendly and they have quite an extensive wine collection; they have a winder (that's a wine binder) because they have so many options."
"4","This was my first experience and it was quite delightful the wine list was the most extensive I have ever seen. Even though I personally am not a wine connoisseur the rest of my group assured me of this fact. I mean they even will sell you a the wine list as a souvenir! \nAnyways on to the food the most important part! I had the lamb tenderloin which was great the sauce brought out juicy lamb goodness. I tried the sugar shank pork and that was quite good and a large portion. The sides were just ok so that is why this isn't rated higher.\nGreat spot for a night out in old town especially for the whom love wine. Get the lamb and don't look back."
"3","All male employees are required to have the spiky, messy, moussey hair look in order to keep their jobs. Apparently. It kills me. It's like attack of the retail clones. And the men's department isn't much more inventive. It's like the Greg Norman collection threw up all over. Kinda like dad golfing clothes meets 18 different kinds of various polo style shirts. Now, the men's shoe department....when they have sales....is toe tappin' fun. Great shoes and great deals. Consciously disheveled hair man (with the funny mustache) is the most helpful. Love the piano playin, especially around the holidays. Very New York. But the men's department? I have better luck at Macy's."
"3","I am writing this review because of Salsa. Yes the pollo quesadilla is amazing. And the burro's are fantastic. There salsa though is out of this world; yes it is expensive, but for good reason. I use to be a regular here, kind of a creature of habit. My love for the spicy side of life was quenched here. There salsa is made with several exotic peppers that can only be found in Mexico. That is why it is over six dollars a pint. The rest of there food is amazing, but pay the extra and get your piece of salsa heaven!"
"3","This is good mexican food for phoenix standards (Im from SoCal) but just satisfactory overall. Serviice wasnt very friendly, but for the accomidations the the prices are reasonable.\n\nThe management made a bad decision for this restaurants value offering to customers. They should either be a fast food diner with cheap prices or an affordable alternative for dine in eaters with better service and atmosphere. They are somewhere in between and the concept just does not work well."
"1","I ordered delivery from GrubHub and really regret it.  The food showed up without the drink I ordered, which normally wouldn't be a big deal, but these guys chare $9 for delivery!!!! PLUS, he got his 15% tip!  For that kind of cash he should have gone to the corner store to get it.  His 'I'm sorry' cost me alot of $$$$.\n\nAnd, to top it off, threw out the food.  They put an enchilada into styro without a foil lining, so the enchilada melted the container, rendering the food inedible.  Awful customer service."
"3","Service was spotty and the kitchen was not clean. \n\nIt used to be my favorite restaurant in Arizona now I'm debating if I'll give it another chance."
"4","Denny's has expanded their menu to the point where they are now a force to be reckon with for this class of restaurant. Fresh spinach as a side? I think so. Also, be sure to try red potato side - some of the best I've ever had. Think crispy, hot and fresh and goes great with tobasco.  $1.99 for a bowl of their chicken noodle soup with your entree? Hell yes! Much better quality than canned soup or even the fresh deli soups in the supermarkets. The chicken tender dinner is my go to menu item of choice. I've dined here twice in the last month and I have greatly enjoyed myself both times. Sure, you'll occasionally have to contend with the coughing and wheezing elderly person or obnoxious kid, but overall I give the big thumbs up for approval. Throw in an occasional coupon or one of their specials - it's an outright bargain."
"2","I have to tell you that it pains me to give the restaurant by this name such a crappy review rating. I have been to two others of these in southern California and they are both 5*s in my book (and everyone I go there with every time I go down to visit). So, maybe I had high expectations. But no, I think they truly earned a 2. They may not even have a chance to redeem themselves with me. First impressions are SO important. \n\nWe went on Friday morning pretty much during peak breakfast time for most that do not get up at the crack of dawn. It was about 930am. We fully expected a wait for breakfast and as we suspected we had one. The young man functioning as host had a rather unique method. He did not write anyones names down, he just tried to remember who was who and in what order, even as people filed in. I guess it seemed to work ok as we did not hear any fights and got seated in a timely fashion. (Thank goodness for being a party of two and being able to sit at a little table.)\n\nI knew ahead of time what I wanted to order, though I was concerned that it would be too huge for me, would take a long time to cook, and my leftovers would have to sit in the car all day. I ALWAYS order the apple pancakes. They are my favorite. I just love them. Even if they take 30-45 minutes to bake and are humungous. Imagine sauteed apples with a pancake/cake batter poured on it with lots of cinnamon, baked in the oven. Yes, its sooo good. Usually. I was quite happy to see that they had a option of a Junior apple pancake, smaller version of the same goodness I usually like. They should all do this.  SG ordered a regular egg dish, which also comes with some pancakes. \n\nAfter about 45 minutes, my pancake arrives. BURNT! So, if I had gotten it about 5 minutes earlier, it would have been perfect? Ironic. I thought it would be ok, but I could not eat the charred edges, they just were too burnt. Steve's meal took another  5 minute to come. My meal is the one that takes forever and then its like they forget the other order. I noticed this at the neighboring table and blew it off until it happened to us. They need to time things better. My food would have been cold if I was polite enough to wait.\n\nOur service was also pitiful. I had to get up and get the syrup from the bus station myself. Coffee refills were few and far between too. But, we were headed to a ball game, so we probably did not want to have too much coffee on board. I did notice the service at the neighboring tables with a different waitress appeared to be much better than ours, but I can only rate our experience. \n\nWe will likely not be back here. There are lots of breakfast options elsewhere and I can save my Apple pancake as a treat for Socal."
"3","Slow slow slow service from our server.  \nNot the best start.\n\nCame for the apple pancake cuz it's been years since we've had it.  Also ordered the chorizo & cheese omelette.  We're going to split these two entrees so it is going to be more than enough.\nCoffee is good.  Limited soda selection so my dining guest ordered the strawberry lemonade which gets one free refill.\n\nThey do NOT take credit card, it's cash only and for your convenience (?) they have an ATM available.  Seriously, why pay credit card processing fees when you can collect money by making an ATM machine available.  :-p\n\nThe omelette WAS yummy, the pancake was pretty good but I actually needed to use a tiny bit of syrup for each bite cuz it seemed to lack the intensity I had remembered.  Must be aging brain cells.\n\nService picked up once our waitress finally took our order.  \nIt seems there are plenty of regulars that visit this place.\n\nHeads up on the parking.  It seems as if the parking space is kind of lacking.  It looked as if customers have to park in the street it the small lot is full.\n\nWill we be going here again anytime soon?  Nah, it's not likely unless I have an out of town guest or a hankerin' for another apple pancake."
"1","Made the mistake of eating here twice. Once, because I thought it would be good based on what others had told me, and once because someone else insisted we go. (They were sure it would be a much better experience my second time around.)\n\nHere's a tip for the owner/manager:\n\nHire wait staff whose first language is ENGLISH or who speak it FLUENTLY\nHire wait staff who are friendly and efficient\nHire wait staff who act like they really care if I return\nHire wait staff who really want me to tip them\nTAKE CREDIT/DEBIT CARDS; This is 2012, nearly 2013. The IRS must love you because you don't pay taxes on what you actually make. (Cash only means you only report what you want to, not what you actually rake in. How clever)\n\nThe bacon, the pancakes, and fresh squeezed orange juice were great. The negatives above don't make it worth the extensive wait for a table. This place is over priced, doesn't take plastic, and the wait staff need a huge improvement. \n\nI'll take IHOP any day of the week over this silly place. You do remember you're in Scottsdale, right?"
"2","They burned my eggs.  I never had a place burn my eggs before.\n\nThe Original Pancake House is a VERY retro-looking restaurant attached to a Motel 6 in the middle of Scottsdale.  The place reminds me of the joints that my parents would take me to for breakfast when we were on vacation somewhere.  I'd order breakfast, it wouldn't be all that good, and I'd have a slightly upset stomach for the next hour while we were driving to our next destination.\n\nThe food here is mediocre at best.  I always order my eggs over hard when I'm eating out.  The ones here came with a brown crust and were obviously overcooked.  I tried my wife's and they were soaked in butter--not good--I could feel the old upset stomach coming on again. . .\n\nThe potatoes here are a horror that need  to be experienced in order to believe them.  One bite yields up a mouth bitter with onion, garlic, and grease--no potato to discern.\n\nPancakes, being that they are part of the name of this place, are the specialty of the House.  My wife ordered the Dutch Baby.  She thought it was decent.  It wasn't my taste--reminded me of solidified custard.  The regular pancakes overall were good, but I could have made something like them myself with a pan and a box of Bisquick.  There just wasn't anything here that I could say was distinctive about this place at all--no real reason to put it on my breakfast rotation.  It's got blah food and nice service.  No, I'll pass on this one."
"4","Great service and good food. It's a standard classic breakfast place that has all the expected menu items. I had the pancakes one morning and eggs another and both came out really good."
"4","03/02/13\n\nStopped by for Easter chocolates for the aunts and Mom.  We all love the dark chocolate-covered almonds and walnuts, but I chose a few truffles to surprise them with.  The male clerk that helped me today was friendly and open to conversation, which was nice.  He offered me the standard sample when anyone walks in (that is, when the clerks aren't slammed with helping customers choose and package truffles into boxes) and another when I was trying to find a coffee-flavored truffle- thank you very much!  \n\nThe Easter-themed wrapping was cute, but a bit sheer.  I suggest finding a supplier that uses thicker paper.  Why bother with gift wrapping, if the recipient can see (no pun intended) what's underneath the romping cartoon bunnies and decorated pastel eggs?  Just a suggestion...\n\nI like this stand-alone store, but I still miss the branch that used to be in Scottsdale Fashion Square, but only because the former mall location kept later hours.  This one closes at 6p on business days."
"1","Five stars for Tiffany's gorgeous selection of jewelry, but if I could give negative starts for the service I would. \n\nLet me start by saying that when you purchase anything from Tiffany's, it is supposed to be an exiting and memorable experience. Not only are you spending a decent amount of money, but generally the things you purchase from Tiffany's are for those close to you, and have a lot of meaning. \n\nMy Tiffany's experience at this location was memorable, no doubt, but not in the heartwarming and sentimental way that it is expected. \n\nFirstly, I am a young college student, and I work in management for every penny I make, and trust me, money isn't easy to come by. Upon entering the store, I was not greeted, and had to approach a sales lady to get her attention. Maybe because I look younger, and therefore couldn't theoretically afford to shop at Tiffany's is an explanation for why I was neglected, but nevertheless it is unacceptable as I was perfectly willing to spend money.\n\nI came in knowing exactly what I wanted to buy, a pair of cufflinks for my boyfriend as a holiday present, politely asked the sales woman if she had them, and her immediate answer was \""Nope!\"" Not only is that rude, but it is very standoffish. So I proceeded to ask her if she had any similar to the style that I wanted and she said yes, pointed into the general direction, and said \""over there.\"" I had to ask her a few times where she was pointing, and finally she clarified. So as I was looking over their smallish selection of cufflinks, she shouted from across the store, \""oh wait I found them\""\nAlright. \n\nSo I took a look at them, and told her I want to purchase them, and handed her my debit card. \n\nFor a purchase of less than $500 there is no way why my debit card wouldn't be accepted at tiffanys. It had plenty of funds and I didn't go over any daily limits, but somehow, she said she couldn't accept my card, and that \""you need to go get cash now from the ATM in order to purchase these\"" \n\nA little frustrated, I said okay and proceeded to go to the ATM and withdraw money, which came out all in tens. Not my fault, not her fault. \n\nThen, surprisingly as I walked into the store, the woman was accompanied by her security staff, speaking of me, and saying that she 'needs to be protected'. Excuse me?! I am a young college student  wearing a white dress, high heels, and carrying several other bags in my hand. What on earth do you think I'm going to do to your sales associated that will whatsoever put her in danger? Absolutely unacceptable. But because I'd already gotten my money from the ATM, I decided to purchase the cufflinks anyway. Otherwise I would have left at this point. \n\nSeemingly annoyed by the fact that I had to pay in all tens, regardless of the fact that I previously offered her my card, she rolled her eyes and proceeded to ring me up. She shoved my bag to me, and then turned her back to me once I had my gift. No thank you, no goodbye, nothing. \n\nUpon leaving the mall, I noticed I didn't have a receipt. I walked all the way back to Tiffany's, only to be confronted by security again. \""Do you have a question?\"" I got my receipt after the sales lady said \""oh sorry, I wasn't thinking about you, here\"" and left. \n\nNeedless to say, I contacted the store manager directly after leaving.  \n\nIf you are a younger person looking to buy a little something special for a loved one, I would advise to go to another Tiffany's location or purchase online. Otherwise, if you look like an affluent, typical Scottsdale resident. You should be fine. \n\n\nI will NEVER return to this Tiffany's location. Ever."
"2","Went to a family event at Fuddruckers this week. Have a relative who digs it. Going there just gives me the willies. \n\nIt definitely seems to have been cleaned up a bit from the last time we went. It was dirty, nasty the previous time. Little bit of solace in that. DIdn't seem as dirty. They'd reupholstered the booths with the torn vinyl. They'd gotten rid of the cracked & torn vinyl red & white striped tablecloths. Still cracked & old formica but it didn't seem as dirty.\n\nAs far as the food, I got a bacon cheeseburger that was just not very good. Ok, but nothing special at all. The fries weren't great either. In years past, I was a big fan of the plastic cheese in the heated cheese fountain but not so much either. After it cools a bit, it's just nasty.\n\nI will go back when future family events require & maybe with less trepidation but I still wouldn't go there by choice with other good options nearby."
"1","Where do I begin? The short version: save yourself hassle, money, and time by going somewhere else.\nHere's my experience. I brought 2 pants for hemming. Measurements were taken. When I went to pick up pants - one pant was good the other was one inch too long. So measurements were taken again. I came back the next day, pants were ready and fit right, but I did not have cash or checks (who carries checks?!) so I left the pants to be picked up another day. Up to this point I had interactions with 2 employees and no one had mentioned cash/check only. On my fourth visit, I was able to retrieve my pants after negotiating the removal of a rush fee? $15 per pant plus $5 rush fee. Nordstrom charges $10 bucks ( I found this out after the fact)"
"2","Went here to get a bunch of stuff altered.. Normal stuff, nothing crazy. \n\n2 stars for the work. Everything fit fine once I picked it up. \n\nMinus 3 stars because the service was poor and the prices are outrageous. The lady who was helping me couldn't get me out the place fast enough. She was on the phone and shuffling other customers are she was pinning my stuff. I might as well have been a mannequin. Also, for how basic the alterations were (hem, taper) I couldn't believe the price when I came to pick them up. \n\nNeedless to say I will be searching for another tailor."
"5","Alan was great!  We had a problem getting our A/C to turn on as Spring came.  I called him up and he swung by that day to take a peek.  Friendly as all can be and very informative.  Turns out it was a problem with our Thermostat.  He is very reasonably priced and always willing to help find a way to make things the most affordable in any situation - while maintaining excellent quality and service.  I Highly recommend Alan's Air for any of your conditioning needs."
"4","this place was so busy we had to sit at the bar table and that was on a Friday night so it was not shocking. the food was great, but not in the least bit healthy. I am sure I could have picked better options but the menu has too many beef or pork based temptations to go another way. I had a shrimp with spicy creamy dipping sauce that was insane and the house specialty the Green Chile Pork Stew was an amazing adventure. This stew was simply pork with hot cheese and strips of green hot peppers all cooked together in a small urn that you might have see hanging over a campfire 100 years ago. The atmosphere was fun and lively and the service was very good. I guess there are some desert specialties but we didn't try any- a bakery at the front of the restaurant makes it easy to take home the delicious-looking desserts as well."
"4","We came here for Happy Hour Saturday night and had a great time. We sat next to a couple that had been coming for more than a decade, before it was at this location. \n\nThe huckleberry margarita for $5 was yummy. I had two! They also had quite a few $5 wines during HH, which we will have to try next time. For food we ordered the rotisserie flat bread and of course the chili verde pork which was sooooo good. I enjoyed ever bite I had with the buttery tortillas. It was a mistake ordering this as I have craved it several times since. \n\nThey have a large bar area and it seems most of the people who come here are regulars and so friendly. The complimentary beef jerky at the bar top is also good, but be warned it is dry. \n\nI can't wait to come back and have some more chili verde pork!"
"5","Five stars because it's a place were comfort food meets a classy and friendly atmosphere, meets a perfect and very attentive service. The duck breast was spectacular, I'd totally recommend having the duck. It took them longer than expected to bring us the starters and they came separately, and they took them off the bill. We were definitely delighted by great food and a great service."
"5","This place was recommended by friends who just ate here the night before.  When we arrived, we were greeted and seated promptly and were given a basket full of warm bread and biscuits. They were delicious!  We started off with their green chili pork appetizer. This was my favorite dish of the evening.  It was kind of like a stew with tender chunks of pork simmered in this flavorful green chili stock topped with cheese.  It came in a cute miniature cast iron pot, piping hot with a side of warm, soft, and chewy tortillas.  Yummy!  Had I known how good it really was, I would've just ordered two of these and be happy for the night.  We then had the trout with capers, almonds and brown butter.  This was another winning dish. The capers were deep fried, so a lot of the briny taste disappeared leaving us with these little salty, crispy buds of goodness that perfectly complimented the the entire dish. The trout came with a huge slice of corn bread that was also very delicious.   My hubby ordered the short rib tacos which were full of flavor with plenty of cilantro and zesty sauce to bring it all together.  For dessert, we had the chocolate cake and bread pudding, both of which were good, but nothing extraordinary.  Overall, it was a great experience and I would recommend this place to anyone who is in the area."
"3","It was a convenient walk over from the FireSky hotel across the street. We started with the green pork chili. It was tasty, but not hot. We also had the lamb fondue, which is lamb rack with a squash sauce to dip them in. The squash \""fondue\"" part was quite tasty. The lamb was cooked well.\n\nFor the main course I tried the braised short rib. It was really big. It didn't have a ton of flavour; a shame for such a tasty meat. It needed salt & pepper and the core seasoning just didn't stand out.\n\nThe food is good, but I feel it's all a bit under seasoned. Everything (except the lamb fondue) could have had some extra punch to it. Still, it wasn't so bad that you feel ripped off, so I'm going 3 stars on this."
"2","Don't understand the 3-5 stars for this place.  It smells divine when you walk in though that is for sure.  Ordered the organic agave margarita - good drink but the appetizer (shrimp brochette) was only meh and my grilled fish tacos (yellow tail) were not good - fish was dry and I like some mango or pineapple type sauce with it to counteract the savory fish - overall ok but won't be back."
"5","Everything is awesome.  Guac.  Their unique version of carne guisada tacos.  Carne con Queso was unique.  Redfish was tasty as well as the filet and Grouper."
"5","OMG   GRAET VALUE!  The happy hour here is awesome. Do try their big Ass burger as it's the best!\nThe ambience, service and every  item we ordered was most excellent !  Inexpensive drinks too.  Happy hour is first come first serve....and busy as the word is out. Get there early!"
"3","Went there for a family B-Day celebration and thought it was fine.  Our server did a great job.  She checked in just the right amount of times, not overbearing and didn't disappear either.  As for the food: the roasted chicken flat-bread was a nice starter, Salad was good and fish tacos were well prepared, not too heavy and tasty. For all of that I would have easily given Roaring Fork 4 stars.  The reason I didn't is that their restroom was an absolute disaster. Yes, its connected with the office building above the restaurant but that is still no excuse. And when I write, \""disaster\"" what I really mean is \""disgusting\"".  I won't go into detail other than to say, I rarely even notice a restaurant's restroom facilities and have never written a word about one.  But given the amount of business that Roaring Fork does and the amount of money being spent nightly in this place, these guys really need to stretch the budget to get this facility serviced every hour or so to make sure its clean and reflects the standards of the restaurant overall."
"5","I made a reservation to go here for my sister's 21st birthday, and overall, it was a great experience! \nThe food was absolutely delicious, and our waitress provided excellent service.  We were sat in the patio/dining area, and it was a great atmosphere.  My sister got to order her first drink, and she thought they were good-- her favorite was the Category 6 Lemonade!  We also ordered a white russian, huckleberry martini Martini, and a Chocolate Martini.  \nFor food, we got the Scallops, Spinach Chicken Waldorf Salad, Lamb Chops & Fondue, and the Green Chili Mac and cheese.  The rest of the table ordered the \""Big Ass Burger\"", which was excellent, and huge!!! \nSince it was her birthday, the restaurant allowed me to bring a birthday cake, and they served it after dinner, and lit the candles for us! \nOverall, it was an awesome dinner! I would highly recommend going here, and I am sure we will go back for more burgers!!!"
"5","Found this place about 15 years ago.  You guessed right....a referral.  Been referring and using ever since.  This is a no nonsense - CUSTOMER SERVICE oriented family business.  The staff is the same since the original trip.  \n\nIf you are looking for fair pricing, personal service and no \""extra\"" suggested  upselling, this is a great place for you.  Wouldnt even think of taking my vehicles anywhere else.  Special thanks to this staff that goes out of their way for the little things too."
"4","If you are looking for an new Optometrist or need new glasses, please check this place out. The entire staff is very friendly, professional, and helpful. There is an small yet perfect selection of frames, so it does not feel like a glasses factory. I care about the Earth and this place is one of the few in the area that carry eco-friendly frames from Eco and Drift. I highly recommend the establishment and will go no other place for my eye care. Thank you to all the staff at Eyecare Plus. Keep up the great work!"
"3","\""I read the news today...Oh boy!\""\n\nhttp://tinyurl.com/ylpza9a\n\nGlenn Bell Jr. died this past weekend at the tender age of 86...a long life of slingin' taco's to be sure:)\n\nI hadn't been to Taco Bell in almost 4 years, until today...I was moved to drop by Taco Bell in a sort of tribute to Glenn...one of the more prominent \""voices\"" during my formative years:)\n\nThis Taco Bell in particular...store # 22354 is one of the more important spiritual touch points for paying tribute to Glenn...Scottsdale was the home of the first Taco Bell franchise (and the fact that Westaco, Inc's.

Done!\n\nIt may still be \""truish\"" with the \""cheapo\"" menu:)\n\nBut it has never really been very good:(\n\nThat was something I actually didn't discover until a trip to LA with a girlfriend (the same trip that I discovered In-n-Out:)...real Mexican food is very different than the goop that Glenn had sold me over the years...and very much better:)\n\nBut that didn't stop me from eating at Taco Bell...beggars can't be chooser's...and I was a beggar for a few years.\n\nToday was a nostalgia stop for me (as was my last visit to a Taco Bell a few years ago), as well as a tribute to Glenn:)\n\nI was more interested in watching my \""beefy burrito\"" being made this time...the ladies in the kitchen pulled various levers in response to the computerized instructions for my order on the monitors overhead...the different shades of unidentifiable goop that cascaded onto the flour tortillas...the quick hand movements of their ritual wrapping of the burrito (I once dated a girl that worked at Taco Bell...she knew how to wrap a burrito...but that's another story:)\n\nIt still isn't very good food...but everyone at this location is sweet and pleasant, my order was correct, I was in severe need of a retox after a 6 miler this morning and I did manage to eat about 2/3 of the burrito...even with mulitple \""bags\"" of hot sauce it was not very good:(\n\nBut that's not the fault of the sweet ladies behind the counter, nor of Westaco, nor of Glenn Bell...I think when Pepsi or YUM or whoever got their hands on Taco Bell...well...I'm not writing this to get on a rant about corporate agendas vs. quality:)\n\nI wanted to give them an extra star...just for being who they are and where they are, but I hear the spirit of Glenn Bell telling me \""don't do it, Donald...make them earn it\"" :-)\n\nThat's all I need, another voice in my head...Thanks Glenn:)"
"3","It's been a while since I've been to this Taco Bell.  I dropped in for lunch yesterday and had great service from the cashier Juan.  He was friendly, patient, and made sure the order was correct.  He also made recommendations to customers on the combo menu if it saved them money or if there was a similar items that they might be interested in.  He should be recognized for his effort as most fast food employees don't give a **** about their job or customers.\n\nMy food came out fast and accurate.  I ordered a 7 Layer Burrito and 2 Bean Burritos.  The only knock on it was that the Bean Burritos were messy.  When they wrapped them, they got red Sauce all over the outside of it...so the Sauce got on my hands.  Oh well, that happens sometimes during the busy lunch rush.\n\nReturn Factor - 60%"
"1","this place is creepy.  there was a cop standing around patrolling all the pizza eaters last Saturday.  what kind of restaurant has police officers parading around to intimidate its patrons?  Hire private security like every other establishment.  Seriously a cop at 2 in the morning at a pizza place on a Saturday.  No thanks."
"2","I've been twice now.  Both times the food quality was just average.  I dock an additional star for being overpriced.\n\nThe basil crispy chicken just didn't work for me.  Maybe it's their execution, but the \""flash frying\"" of the basil just creates a bitter flavor that ruins the dish.\n\nThe pad thai was very average.  I know it's not an adventurous thai dish, but I had a hankering for it and was disappointed that it wasn't better.\n\nI do like the atmosphere, and the service was solid.  I liked Phuket, a beer I don't remember having had before.\n\nThe tables on the sidewalk are dog-friendly."
"3","Authentic Thai, no.  Tasty food and good times, yes.\n\nWhen I'm in Scottsdale, for business, one of my clients loves to bring me here for happy hour.  We order up a bunch of apps and whatever bottles of wine the bartender recommends.  The bartender alone gets 5 stars from me.  He's always chatty and remembers our preferences...not to mention he's always got the wine bottles ready for us. \n\nOn our last visit, we had the pla bites, mango spring rolls and basil chicken.  All were good, but nothing to wow me.  I'm not even sure how this place gets billed as authentic.  But hey, I guess I won't knock them.  All I can say is that Malee's serves up tasty grinds, regardless of authenticity."
"4","12-26-10\n\nBy the time I knew it , Christmas day was over and I was craving  Thai food.  My husband knew I can't last more than three days without it.  So we started searching for a Thai restaurant and Malee's Thai came up.  It was close to our hotel as I discovered, the owner is an American woman.  I was so excited to find out how she did it.\n\nUpon entering the restaurant, it took awhile for the hosts to come out and seat us.  The restaurant has nice simple decor, casual elegant more than most Thai restaurant.\n\nAbout the food:  We order dumplings, soft shell crab, and crab Rangoon. \nI thought the dipping sauce was very good.  My husband thought it was so-so.  I order crispy chicken with garlic and basil , with steamed rice.  The sauce in chicken was very unique.  I liked it.  \n\nI would put her restaurant into Asian Fusion category.  Much, much better  than PF Chang!!\n\nOverall Malee's Thai was a pleasant dining experience.  We will come back if we are in the area and try some other dishes."
"4","Best Thai place in old town Scottsdale. Great ambiance and good service. The bar was also good. \n\nHad the pad Thai noodles with the vegetarian option. Tasted excellent. \n\nWould highly recommend  this place for people who just want to have a good casual evening."
"3","Food was decent but not amazing while the service was pretty slow.  Atmosphere was rather stale and uninteresting so I'd recommend take-out."
"2","I am leaving AZ soon and didn't want to go without getting myself a great pair of cowboy boots. I heard Saba's was the place to go for quality and service so I was excited to check it out. \nAll I can say for my experince there is that these people are rude rude rude!!!\n When I first walked in noone greeted me even though there were about 3-4 sales people just standing around. Normally that doesnt bother me but when its combined with everything else it really irritates me. One of the sales peopld then proceded to follow"
"3","A good place to meet with some friends for some drinks, but I agree with the space issue.  Just moving from one side of the bar to another can get downright acrobatic."
"1","Mulligans, I am disappointed in you.  This has previously been one of my favorite go to spots on the weekend, and I used to think of it as the perfect place to end the night.  However, it has gone downhill over the past few months, and after several horrible customer service experiences I do not think I will be frequenting this establishment again.  Let me be specific....If you mess with my money - and do so consistently and without apology...then I will not return, and I will be sure to tell as many people as I can, regardless of how \""fun\"" your bar might be.\n\nA few months ago, I went to Mulligans, and when ordering my drink, I asked them to just leave a tab open and handed them my card.  I ended up ordering one more beer, and then closed my $9 tab at the end of the night.  The next day after checking my bank account, I was astonished to see a $50 hold on my account from Mulligans.  I immediately called them to inform them of the error, but was told, pretty rudely, that it was standard procedure for them to hold $50 for any opened tab, and that it would just \""fall off\"" in a few days at my bank...nothing else they could do.   They did tell me that there was a small sign on the bar that mentioned this policy, and that I should have read it first (because that's apparently what people look for or notice when they go to the bar).  Furiously, I waited for 5 business days for the funds to become available again.\n\nA month or so later, I went in again.  Same situation, same low dollar bill, same $50 hold...although this time I just kicked myself for not remembering it the first time.  I did call the manager to ask if there was a way to avoid this other than paying cash (which I never carry), and was told that if I had closed my account after each drink rather than keep an open tab, I would just be charged for the actual dollar amount owed each time.  Good to know (although also a huge pain in the butt).\n\nFlash foward to last week.  I went to Mulligans again, this time for St. Patricks Day.  Based on my previous conversation with the manager, I was confident that if I just closed out my tab each time, I would be fine.  I ordered one beer (specialty for $3 dollars), and closed out.  Later that night I went back and ordered two more beers (total, $6) and closed out.  The next day, I checked my account.....and found that there were TWO holds on my account from Mulligans, for $25 each.\n\nI immediately called again and explained the situation.  The person on the phone immediately started in on their \""policy\"" to hold funds when there is an open tab.   I told him that I had been aware of that , and that is why I closed out each time...So why I was being \""held\"" $50 for a total of $9 was a mystery to me (and I was seriously regretting the tip at this point).  He stated \""well,  the best I can tell you is to just wait for it to drop off, there's nothing we can do\"".  I told him that was not an acceptable solution to me, and he interrupted to say sarcastically \""you really need to take this up with someone else...I'm just the barback\"".  So I asked him to take down my phone number and have the manager call me that night.  He took on an incredibly rude and sarcastic tone, and said (overenthusiastically)   \""absolUTELY!!   I would LOVE to do that for you\"".  I ignored the tone and gave him my phone number anyway, and again requested that the manager call me that night.  He replied \""ABSOLUTELY\"" again in his rediculous tone, and then hung up on me.  I never heard from the manager.\n\nThis is incredibly poor customer service, a poor way to handle your customer's money, and a really EASY way to lose business.  By the way, it's 4 days later and the funds are still being held.  This is a recession people, I go places with cheap beer for a reason!  And I can guarantee you there are a million other places to go in Scottsdale that serve $3 beers and don't do it while stealing from your pocketbook (even if it IS supposedly temporary).  I suggest staying away from this place unless you like to have your money taken and you enjoy rudeness."
"5","What a fantastic restaurant!  I was in town with a business group and this was a last minute change from our originally scheduled dining destination and I'm so glad we accidentally stumbled upon this culinary oasis near Old Town Scottsdale.  Even our colleagues who work only a block away had never heard of, let alone visited, Medizona but I'm sure now they'll be back.\n\nBilling itself on the menu as \""Mediterranean Inspired Southwestern Cuisine\"" I was not sure what to expect from the exotic sounding dishes listed.  \n\nWe started out with three appetizers. The first was Blackened Shrimp with White Bean Hummus, Mango-Olive Salsa, and Charbroiled Tomatillo Sauce which was good.  Not sure I got any of the hummus but the salsa and sauce were excellent accompaniments to the large, plump (and surprisingly not overcooked) shrimp.  Next was a \""Rabbit, Fig, and Pine Nut Baklava with Quail Egg and Pomegranate Sauce.\"" The baklava was interesting and the flavors worked well togerther.  The quail egg came separately and I never saw the pomegranate sauce so the small fried egg on the side was an odd accompaniment. The last appetizer was \""Eggplant Tacos with Lamb, Arugula and Kasseri Cheese\"" which was excellent.  \n\nThe salad of baby greens was accompanied by a small piece of roasted goat cheese that was very strong but good if taken in tiny bites with the greens.  The almond-honey brittle in the salad was interesting but made the salad a bit too sweet.\n\nOur group hada choice of three entrees and all received glowing reviews.  I had the Achiote Rubbed Pan-Fried Salmon over Organic Lentil Polenta with Morel Mushroom-Baby Clam Sauce.  The polenta was a little dry but the salmon was cooked perfectly and the sauce was excellent.  Others had  Moroccan Spiced Chicken Breast\nBlack Bean-Saffron Couscous, Cilantro-Yogurt Sauce and harbroiled Prime Tenderloin of Beef over Potato-Leek Gratin, Butternut Squash, and Spinach.\n\nOur group was trying to rush back to the hotel and most missed the incredible desserts.  I lucked out and managed to grab some to take back.  Prickly Pear Tiramisu with Turkish Coffee-Pistachio Sauce and  Chocolate Flourless Cake with Caramelized Bananas, Peanuts and Marshmallow Foam."
"5","psssst.... c'mere...... let me let you in on something kinda cool.  Medizona might be the best restaurant you've never heard of.  I mean, really, how is this place not huge?!   I don't have the descriptors to let you know how much I like this place.  \n\nThe food here is creative, attractively presented and fantastic on the palate.  It's southwestern and mediterrenean.  Yeah, \""huh?\""  I know.  I had the same reaction.  It's like Chino Bandido, it doesn't make sense, it doesn't sound like it'd work, but it does.  Go try it for yourself.   Ratatouille quesadilla.  Chorizo potato cake.  Lamb with a moussaka tart with red pepper sauce. And, of course, the prickly pear tiramisu.\n\nGo. \n\nTonight."
"4","When I hit a quarter of a century in years, I decided to go the uncharacteristically classy route and celebrate with something chi chi and razzdango. Exchange the morning after whiskey dents and zombie flavored scratch 'n sniff composure for a posh dinner out on the town.\n\nNow I'm gonna share a secret with y'all. I'm no gourmand. I like a fancy pants meal as much as the next, but I'm in the cheap mo fo demographic, so I don't know dick about fine dining in the Phoenix area. I rely on you Yelpers to guide me down the path of good taste when it comes to nice shit and stuff.\n\nCha, cha, cha.\n\nMEDIZONA.\n\nIt even sounds fancy, and I'm convinced it should be said with jazz fingers and maybe some light orchestral flare.\n\nAn upscale, Mediterranean-Southwestern fusion restaurant?\n\nIntriguing.\n\nRabbit and fig baklava atop a pomegranate balsamic reduction, topped with a quail egg and surrounded by crispity parsnip curls?\n\nWicked fricken good.\n\nIt puts fig newtons everywhere to shame. Layers of airy, buttery phyllo filled with tender shredded fig and rabbit would have been much too sweet solo, but the addition of a tart reduction grabbed that figgy sweetness and tangoed round my palate! Although I'm convinced that the quail egg was just intended to be a cute little hat for the baklava. Whatevs. At least now I can claim that psh, yeah I've had quail egg before, no biggie.\n\nWild caught halibut with chorizo potato cake, haricot verts and carrots with orange caper cream sauce?\n\nMelt in my mouth delicious.\n\nTry to sneak a nibble of chorizo potato cake from my plate and I will fork you. Hard. You might pull back something a little stumpy. That was the most delectable little nibblet on the plate. The fish was super flaky and buttery, although the sauce was forgettable. And I think it's pretentious and hoity toity to call green beans \""haricot verts.\"" Merde!\n\nRoast loin of lamb, moussaka tart, mashed taters, celery root, mint oil, and roasted red pepper sauce?\n\nEh. \n\nThe lamb was ordered medium rare and prepared to perfection. Mint oil should be mandatory garnish for all baby lambs. Make em prance around the field wearing mint garlands until they're led to slaughter, where said garland will be compressed into the requisite drizzle of mint oil. Or something like that. Everything else on the plate was served cold though. Blech.\n\nThe service was impeccable, the patrons gripe worthy. Our waiter was well informed and personable, although he disappeared half way through the meal, was replaced and we never saw him again, which was kinda weird. \n\nThe customers he was serving were pretty inconsiderate. There was a huge party of people with kids rip roaring around the restaurant off in the side room. The waiter apologized on their behalf, stating that it was an abnormal night and that kids didn't normally frequent the place, and at least they left soon after that. I don't go out to listen to the rip roar of impatient ankle biters. Instant plus two for the atmosphere as soon as they left.\n\nBut then a large group of older patrons came in and bitched about how they couldn't read the menus because it was too dark, so they turned up the lights, bent the atmosphere over the side of a chair and fucked it hard.\n\nSo I think I'm going to be a downer on the super streak Medizona's having and only give it a four. It's good but I don't think I'd ever go back. Too many other fancy schmancy restaurants waiting in the wings for an opportunity to knock my socks off. No need to return."
"5","Elizabeth is an outstanding stylist! I came to her with orange hair, because my last dye job was horrendous and I attempted to fix it myself. I walked into the salon and she was the only stylist there and with a client. I was in tears. I only waited a moment before Elizabeth acknowledged me. She was kind, knowledgeable, professional and available to help me the following day. Its rare to find a hair stylist in Old Town Scottsdale that care as much as the stylists do in this salon. Color correction, cuts, Brazilian Blowouts, you name it, this lady does it! And it didn't cost me my first born either! Scottsdale precision and perfection without the Scottsdale cost. This salon has a cool unpretentious vibe as well...Its worth checking out!!"
"3","Now offering free towel dry with #3 or #4 which are $8 and $10. Your simple and mediocre drive thru car wash. At least they aren't trying to sell you on much!"
"1","I lived here a few years back, and I would not recommend it. The area is decent but the complex itself is pretty bad. Good luck finding parking on weekends for guests, it's non existent. I had the misfortune of needing to use the laundromat, the facility was gross. You needed to load money on to a card to use it, if the office was closed you were out of luck. I had terrible neighbors, a pothead below who would just freak out and break stuff for no reason. The guy next to me was no better; his deranged girlfriend broke in to his place. This is what it was like. Avoid at all costs."
"5","I don't come to Dillard's expecting a Nordstron-like shopping experience. If I need to be pampered, I go to Nordy's. Dillards is where I come when I already know generally what I want, and I know no one is less expensive. IMO, Dillard's strength is their competitive pricing and their unbelievable sales. For years, I assumed this was only temporary, the Arkansas-based retailer will randomly go upscale. They've never done this and as a result, I still love shopping at a Dillard's.\n\nThis isn't to say the service is bad, it's just that store employees do not out-number customers and sometimes this can \""feel\"" like it's the case in a Nordy's---especially in Men's suits."
"1","I was with my girlfriend on a Saturday afternoon, just choosing dresses for an upcoming wedding we are to attend this summer.  She picked out some great dresses, and we were off to the fitting rooms.  Now this is we had the problems.  \n\nI walked into the fitting room with her as usual (to help her with zipping them on).  I have done this numerous times throughout the day at Macy's and other dept stores without any problems.  I was then yelled at by an \""employee\"" who told me that I WAS NOT ALLOWED IN THERE!!!.  My girfriend and I felt threatened and instead chose to find another fitting room.  We decided not to argue with the \""employee\""\n\nThen we walked about 100 feet to the right of the juniors department and found a fitting room, and a rather helpful associate helped us in, with no issues whatsoever about me having a penis.  We were in the middle of trying on our third dress, (which we found one that we really liked, and fit well too), then another employee came knocking on the door stating that \""MEN AREN'T ALLOWED IN THE FITTING ROOMS\"" and I explained that I was just helping her zip on the dress, and had no intentions other than that.  She said she would help her zip on the dress if she needed it.  I explained that she did not feel comfortable with anyone else touching her, and seeing her in the fitting room without me being there.  That was not satisfactory enough for the employee and I stated that we would would be leaving and no longer be customers of Dillards ever again.  \n\nWhat  a shame, as Men are treated differently than woman, and just because I happened to have a penis, then I wasn't allowed.  We were planning on making a purchase on a Sunny Sunday afternoon, and some employees just made our day a hell of a lot worse than when we walked in.\n\nI later called the store that afternoon to see if I could speak with a manager, and was given one over the phone.  The conversation was about how I was treated, and she stated that they don't' let men even be employed in the Juniors dept. What a sexist policy.\n\nDon't let your 1955 set-in ways hit your ass on your way out of my wallet you sexist, chauvinistic \""company\"""
"3","Dillards has been at Fashion Square for as long as I can remember coming to Scottsdale.  It is a decent department store with a wide range of designers.  Not a ton of the designers I like - I find most of what they sell for women is either too young (such as BCBG) or too fuddy-duddy (such as Reba McIntyre's clothing line) for my age range and style.  But they usually have some pretty good sales, so I always pop in to see if I can find any unique Michael Kors, Calvin Klein or Elie Tahari pieces.  There have been a lot of times I've seen an item in Canada and have gotten it a lot cheaper here.  Great shoe department - I think they could do a bit more to spruce up their accessories department though.  It is an older store and somewhat in need of a makeover."
"2","The hostess didn't ask us where we wanted to sit and forgot to set our table. Our waitress was very good but seemed to be too busy. They need better management to train their people to work as a team. The host staff should have been helping in other areas. Other than that the food was good but it would have been nice to get some warm complimentary bread. I had to ask multiple times for the bread and when we did finally get some it was cold and slightly stale."
"5","All I can say is wow. Easily some of the best Italian food I've had. You certainly get what you pay for, the portions are no joke. If you are in the mood for a classy, delicious Italian dinner... this is the place to go!"
"3","It's Olive Garden with a personality. Buca di Beppo, though a chain, has more than a few things going for it. \n\nThe Scottsdale location can easily accommodate large groups. Family style servings contribute to great interaction with friends and family. The d\u00e9cor is gaudy and creative, with an emphasis on Italian heritage and a touch of humor here and there. Gene Simmons on the celebrity wall? Generally friendly staff. Kid friendly (triangular crayons!). And the food is decent.\n\nAny negatives? The entrees, while solid, don't have the impact of a true fine Italian restaurant. On this visit we ordered the Apple Gorgonzola Salad. It was enjoyed by all. The Chicken Cannelloni and the Chicken Marsala were great. The Baked Ziti, however, was dry and far from flavorful. Three out of four isn't bad I suppose. And a single mistake is less catastrophic since everything is being shared family style anyway.\n\nWe had two children in our group and felt pressured to pop for the $4.99 kid's Cioccolata and Pisa Punch served in glasses with flashing lights in their base. The lids were poorly designed, subject to spillage around the straw, but the kids did enjoy the beverages. $10 of enjoyment? Well. At least refills were free. \n\nOrdering the right amount of food from the family style menu can be tricky. The portions are generous, so it's easy to order too much. For example, our server's recommendation to share a small salad for four adults was perfect, even though the written menu would have suggested the larger size. I'd recommend getting some friends together and ordering several small entrees for variety,\n\nI'd also recommend just letting kids share the adult family style entrees rather than ordering from the children's menu (unless they just have to have macaroni and cheese). The four and five year olds in our party were fine with it and it helped them feel fully part of the group. They weren't quite as supportive, however, when we refused to order the giant brownie sundae. I was willing, but..."
"4","We came here for my birthday while visiting Scottsdale. We hadn't been to this restaurant chain before, so we weren't sure what to expect.\n\nInterestingly, they start you off for a walk through the kitchen. There's even a booth in the kitchen (by reservation for you foodies out there!) if you want to watch them cook. \n\nMy husband is Italian, and he enjoyed the meal, so it must be good. We had an appetizer platter with mozzarella sticks, calamari and stuffed mushrooms, and a special gnocchi with pancetta (I'm pescatarian so I had to pick around a bit). The food is delicious and served family style. We had enough food for lunch the next day!"
"2","Maybe it was a bad night, but after reading the reviews I expected more.  It was quite uneventful.  Walked-in and there was bunch of people in a group.  Not sure what kind of group, but without them the place was dead...Zzzzzzz.  Oh I'm still writing this review!  They have pretty good prices for food, but maybe there's a reason.  To my chagrin it was basic burger and fries with some lettuce and Thousand Island dressing.  Yawn!!! Okay those people left it's just me and my friend now -- crap!  I'm too young to shut this place down!  Service was good, but serving 2 people isn't really that hard.  The cool thing about the place of course is the moose head.  Not much of a hunter, but I can appreciate it.  Matter of fact next time I will become a hunter and search for a more happening place. - Enjoy!"
"5","This place is gooood. The food seems fresher than most indian food places, and it definitely doesn't taste like it's been sitting out all day. That might actually be a complaint. I'm so used to eating vegetable pakoras that have been sitting in a vat under a heat lamp that these were too fresh for me to like. You know? It's like being raised on Taco Bell and being so used to that as your definition of Mexican food that when you actually go to a Mexican food joint with fresh ingredients you're like, \""WTF is this?\""\n\nOh yeah, and it's definitely more expensive than other places in the valley."
"5","Great night was had with 20+ guests. Have had Indian food in parts of AZ, as well as New York and Australia, this was one of the better places that's for sure. Staff were friendly and attentive and the meals were served quickly. Well worth a return visit."
"5","Drift can be hit or miss as far as the crowd goes, but I always have a good time.  I have been to Drift more times than I can count.  It's always the fallback place if my friends and I are not not sure what to do or if we are not feeling it somewhere else. \n\nThings I've been asked at Drift:\n\n-Man grabs my arm as I am walking by (not the best pick-up technique to begin with- randomly grabbing girls).  \nGrabber- \""Hey, you like Grey Goose?\""\nMe- \""Um, yeah.\""\nGrabber- \""Good, cause I wanna get you loose.\""\nMe- \""That is the worst line ever.\""\nGrabber- \""Really, it didn't work.\""\nMe- \""Nope, you might as well have asked if I'd like a pizza and a f*ck.\""\n\n-Guy grabs my arm and forces me to punch his friend. (Again, what is with all the grabbing?)\nMe to guy I just punched- \""Your friend made me do it.\""\nGuy who forced me to punch his friend- \""Don't worry, he deserved it.\"" \nI won't go into the rest, but he proceeds to teach me a secret handshake before I can get away.  Then, later in the night when I run into him again, he forgets that he already met me and does the exact same thing to me all over again (hand shake and everything).  He thought I was a genius when I beat him to the punch and already knew the moves.\n\nRandom guy corners me.\nR.G.- \""Hey what's your name?\""\nMe- \""Morgan.\""\nR.G.- \""My name's Ryan and this is my friend, Ryan.\""\nMe- \""Really, you're both named Ryan?\""\nR.G.- \""Hey, two Ryans don't make a right.\""\nMe- silence.  A smirk slowly forming on my face because even though it was lame, it was a little creative.  \nR.G.- \""I have a million dollar condo down the street, wanna go back and have a drink with us.\""\nMe- \""I don't think so, you could be a serial killer.\""  Then, I paused because I realized his arm was in a cast.  \""Oh, never mind.  You're injured, you can't kill anybody.\""\nMy friend walks up, probably sensing he needs to save me- \""What's going on?\""\nMe- \""He wants to have drinks in his million dollar condo, but I said no because he might be a serial killer.  Then, I realized I could kick his ass because he only has one good arm.\""\nMy friend- \""What happened to your arm?\""\nR.G.- \""It doesn't work.\""\nMe/my friend stare blankly\nMe- \""What do you mean it just doesn't work?\""\nR.G.- \""Remember the whole Firestone tire recall?  Well, I was in a rollover and that is why my arm doesn't work.  I got a really big settlement, so wanna go to my condo?\""\nMe- I have no words.\n(And no, I didn't go to his damn condo)  \n\nYep, I have found true love and his name is Drift."
"1","I'm all about the tiki thing and the patio but this place is just trashy. It's obvious that this is first on the list for every guy who just turned 21. Everything had a thin layer of barf on it."
"5","Been there twice, wait staff is nice and \""real\"" ( I love a place that has people working who have tattoos).  But that's not the point.  Food was quick, fresh and delicious!  The price was awesome for what we got on a Tuesday before 6pm, a 16oz bud lite, cheese garlic bread, and two big slices of pizza with add. toppings fed the both of us happily.  Definitely going back!"
"2","As a family - we love pizza, and pasta, and hoagies (and wine and beer).  Yes, these guys are capable of good food - just not consistently.  We've eaten in and out and at various SONY locations but this is one closest to our house and one we have TRIED to order for delivery quite a few times and each time we've been let down.  Tonight's order was, yet again, another let down with cold food, a long time delivery (quoted an hour max and we were wondering if we were going to get our food at the hour 15 mark), a big tab (me, hub and small child) and, well, a disengaged driver.  It is what it is... I fear we are running out of boutique-y pizza places in our area - the big chains aren't great but doggone-it they are consistently hot, timely and meet the expectation.  I love supporting local businesses but I shouldn't have to sacrifice quality for my money... right?  The positive - whatever frozen cake that gets thawed enroute - we enjoyed that.  Pizza, pasta and salad...boo.  Damn."
"1","This is the second time I have ordered from this place.  The first time wasn't great... Pizza came barely warm and had way too much cheese, my cookie dessert was slightly burned but the ice cream was still cold and intact.  We also got the Carmel crunch cake, which came freezing cold, hence it was probably frozen to begin with but decent.  Since it was a first time order, I gave them a break.  I ordered the exact same thing tonight and was MAJORLY DISAPPOINTED... My pizza came so cold and had so much cheese on it that when I tried to pull a slice off, the mound of cheese stuck to the other piece and fell completely off... It looked like a congealed cold mess.  The crust is NOT New York style, it's just regular hand tossed.  You can't fold it like New York style pizza should... I thought for sure after the pizza drama that I could count on the cookie... Nope!  The ice cream was completely melted, it was just milky liquid.:(. And again a cold piece of Carmel crunch cake.  This place sucks.  Don't waste your money.  I couldn't even eat the pizza it was so cold and gross... Maybe if my boyfriend was here he could heat it up for breakfast because he will eat anything... More like \""Streets of Domino's Cheap Nasty Pizza\"".... Actually I bet Domino's or Pizza Hut would at least deliver a hot pizza.... Get it together folks."
"3","Have you ever had a caricature drawn of you and a buddy? Did you worry that your enormous nose would be distorted to eight times its normal yet already abundant size? So while your female friend is cute, which you know the lecherous caricature artist will exaggerate, you're going to end up looking like a combination of John Cusack and Adrien Brody.  No? Me either. \n\nBut Martini Ranch should be worried. If caricatured, this little \""I'm everything to everybody\"" bar/club would have a pretty embarrassing picture to put on the wall at home when they get back from Disneyland. \n\nBut it's fun. Fuck. I go and I have a good time. Who can argue with that? \n\nThey have to fire that door guy. You know the one. The one when you have an event scheduled there and he sees eighty people in a new separate line getting off the bus and he wasn't told about it and won't let you in and won't be bothered to get the manager who happens to know about the event.  The same guy who wouldn't let me in the other night because he wouldn't check the list so I had to get my friend to come out and have him check the list. Same freakin' guy. What is his deal? How seriously does he take this life? IT'S MARTINI RANCH!\n\nBut Metalhead is rad. The place is packed on a Sunday night. Love it. \n\nThere's always a fight in the upstairs club. Set your watch by it. \n\nThe patio is a beautiful reprieve, like the end of an unknown warm up act at a concert. \n\nDrink prices are reasonable. \n\nA funny thing happened on the way to the Coliseum, too... I was out with two of my hockey buddies one time at MR and 1) a woman gasped and called me a d-bag in earnest after I said something about her friend 2) some other chicks totally alloted their drunken attention to my friend and not me... Mind boggling. \n\nSo they lose one star for the door guy and one for allowing women to enter who don't immediately gravitate towards me."
"3","Less Douchy Than Expected.\n\nI went last night with a group of friends and was pleasantly surprised at the mix at Martini Ranch. I actually met some really nice people to hang out with (there were a lot of bachelorette parties there) and spent the evening in the club room upstairs with the go-go poles in it (note about the poles - they're on a platform and short so it's hard to do some of the pole tricks on them). \n\nThe DJ had some great dance music playing and everyone was dancing and having a great time without the pretentiousness you might find in other Scottsdale clubs.MR is good for a girls night out or a place to hang out with a group of friends.\n\nBeer's were cheap - $3.50 for a bottle there was plenty of space on the patio so you don't have to be pushed against some creepy guy the whole evening."
"4","SUNDAY nights = Metal Head and Metal Head = 80's AWESOMENESS!\n\nMy review is based solely on Metal Head, an 80's/early 90's rock cover band that rocks Martini Ranch every Sunday night. It's a cheap $5 cover to get in and a must go!"
"1","I could go into a long story about what happened but basically the girls taking cover and the bouncers can't count and are douches.  Will never go back to the place again."
"1","Wish I could give 0 stars. Save your time, save your money. This place is so not worth it, go somewhere else. I couldn't leave fast enough. The staff does not care about customer service and they all have piss poor attitudes. The clientele is disgusting and classless at best. This dump does NOT deserve your business!"
"3","Updated:\nWell, I've been back to Tottie's since I first posted this review.  A few friends who like it made me go.  Much to my surprise, I enjoyed it.  It's no Malee's for Thai, for example, but it's decent.  If you frequent the area for lunch, definitely check it out.  Who knows, you may like it more than me.\n\nOriginal Review:\nWhile the food wasn't terrible, I found the sesame chicken and cashew chicken to be bland.  And, the chicken itself was too chewy.  I've had worse, but not by much."
"4","1. Front Door Wait for table, hostess was busy and had 3 takeout orders + 3 couples at one time plus answering phone. took us 10 minutes just to get seated in a place that had only 12 seated customers n 20+ tables open.\n\n2. Once seated, the staff, busser, waitress, AWESOME.. they knew the regular peoples names, and weren't over powering asking if everything is ok, just right. \n\n3. Appetizer. Broadway Rolls..  Tasted Fresh shrimp, n crab, but crab was minced, but tasted awesome.. very pleased,\n\n4. PhoTai and Shanghai Rice, Both great.. for Vietnamese Pho, i would rate this 3rd on my list of places to order Pho. Rice, it ranks 2nd.. fresh shrimp, and chicken was cooked, but not overdone and dry,, excellent.. \n\nFinal say. I will be back. This may be monthly, due to travel distance Chandler to Scottsdale.. If i want Vietnamese, without the extra variety, Da Vang, or Phu thanh. But if i bring some friends, this would be the best place, because of the variety of the cuisine."
"2","Let me start by saying whatever happened to cooking Christmas dinner? I am Jewish, so for me Christmas= Chinese food, but apparently the secret is out. I went here tonight with the BF. We had made reservations for 7:30 and arrived at 7:20. The place was clearly understaffed as the two hostesses were running around like crazy acting as waitresses and bussers in addition to trying to host. As we stood there waiting for our table, about half of the tables in the restaurant left. You would think that this would make for a quick seating....surprise! It didn't. We waited for about 30 minutes to be seated. Additionally, several tables who did not have reservations were seated at the same time as us, which would have been fine if there were people working at this restaurant, but there weren't. So the BF and I sit there. The couple (without res) gets water, some small family that was seated at the same time gets water....we get nothing. The waitress comes around and takes their orders. Nothing. The family gets their appetizers and the waitress comes and takes their main entree order. Nothing. The other table gets their beers and sushi...still nothing! The hostess finally came by after at least twenty minutes and took our orders....we still do not have water. For real. And the place has gotten significantly less busy at this point. So we order the tangerine chicken and the pad kee mao with a 7/10 spiciness. We waited and waited. The other couple received entrees and just about finished them before we got our food. It was like we were in an episode of Seinfeld or something. The service was that bad. \n\nWe (finally) get our food and I will admit, the tangerine chicken was tasty. It was sweet and savory...pretty good. The problem is it was luke warm...like it had been sitting for awhile. Not cool. The pad kee mao was a disaster. First, it had about a 1-2 star spiciness level. Not spicy....at all. Second, in addition to not being spicy it was bland and kind of tasted like dishwater. Third, the veggies were still essentially raw. The dish was terrible. I have had much better (real) Thai food for a fraction of the price. We barely touched the dish, but no one showed us any concern or asked if our food was alright. The entire ordeal lasted one and half hours...for just entrees and water. Overall, the experience was terrible. \n\nI know what you're thinking....But Jennifer, it's Christmas!... Yes, I know it's Christmas, but I don't care, it isn't an excuse. I made a reservation. If they they did not have the space, they should have A) not given us a reservation or B) not let in walk ins when they had reservations. Whoever owns this restaurant should have put more thought into staffing for a night that they KNEW would be busy because they took reservations! It was unacceptable. The place only got a second star because the tangerine chicken was good, but I would be hesitant to go here again because apparently my business means nothing to this restaurant."
"2","This review is based on ordering many things from the overall menu over a 1 year period, however one item there deserves a 5 star rating which I will get to\n\nOverall most of the items are fairly americanized and not traditional which you expect from a fusion place - however most items are very average and for the price I do not feel you get good value here \n\nThat being said the one item that does stand out here is their Shrimp Tom Yum Soup which i feel deserves 4 if not 5 stars - it is excellent and flavorful, with a lot of shrimp - make sure to order a side of steamed rice with it medium hot, and you will have a stand out dish\n\nIn general their soups are solid, but the only thing I have not found better somewhere else is their Shrimp Tom Yum soup\n\nGo for the Tom Yum, get your Vietnamese soup from Khai Hoan down the road a few miles"
"2","Great ambience, okay service, boring food. Food was typical \""fusion,\"" heavy on the pseudo-Chinese influence, kind of like a Thai-inspired PF Chang's. Definitely not terrible but I won't go back."
"5","Service was as good as could be expected.  Atmosphere was very nice with elegant lighting and smooth jazz playing or Spanish guitar, thus the Fusion.  Food portions were generous and presented nicely.  Will definitly frequent this place.  Thank you!  Steven"
"2","Oh no, no, no! I went here for lunch today with my bestie after reading mixed reviews. We live close by and love sushi so...why not? We found out sushi is only served at night. I will look again, but I did not see that noted anywhere on their website. Ok, so sushi is out...plan B. I ordered the shrimp and broccoli with beef added and the mango, sticky rice with coconut milk for dessert. I paid extra for the beef, but didn't think about it until I ate the leftovers at home. NO BEEF!! What? Shrimp and brocolli with beef added...without the beef?\n\nThe soup was gross (I can not think of a better adjective). Neither of us ate it. I told the waitress that we didn't want the soup and she nodded and walked away, leaving our full soups on the table for the entire meal. Was it her first day? \n\nFor some reason the waitress brought our dessert with our meal!!! I thought about asking her to take it away and bring it when we were finished our meal, but horrible visions of people spitting in my food popped into my head, further spoiling my appetite. So my mango with sticky rice sat there untouched for about 25 minutes, probably collecting dust particles, lint and spit. GROSS!\n\nNOPE. I will NOT be back unless my meal is free."
"4","Love this place, great Thai food. We ordered Panang, Egg Rolls, Thai Fried Rice and Pad Thai. Everything was amazing except the Pad Thai. They use really thin noodles, which I've not seen before. It wasn't my favorite, but everything else was delicious. I would definitely go back!"
"5","Tottie's is a family owned restaurant where customer service prevails. The food is mouth watering to look at and painfully delicious to eat. \n\nPainful? WHA- The problem is how much you'll want to eat.\n\nMy friend and I stopped in for a late afternoon bite. We had just missed the lunch specials (but that's ok! more to take home) and settled into our luxurious booth. The restaurant offers a variety of seating, ranging from tables to booths to the bar. All look equally appealing. (And can readily accommodate groups.)\n\nMichael charmed us with the joy and eagerness he exuded. After ordering Pad Thai and Panang Curry he generously offered us soup leftover from lunch. (And our rubber arms quickly said yes!) \n\nSOUP\nWhy does this have it's own category? The egg drop soup and sweet and sour are *only* served during lunch hours. (11am - 2pm). If you're lucky some might be leftover and Michael might be around to share. You should try those two soups. And here's a trick. Try those two soups mixed together.\n\nHoy My Goodness.\nThe sweet and sour is a powerfully strong soup offering a kick of spice. The egg drop soup is rich (and has mushrooms, which work quite well) and creamy in a different way. Together? You've got to try it. I highly recommend it. \n\nHAPPY HOUR\nRuns Tuesday thru Friday, 5pm - 7pm. Food and drink specials abound. Sushi rolls are discounted and they offer things like Sake Bombers, Mimosas, a Riesling and a red blend for $5. (Some other wines for $4. Budlight for $2.50.) \n\nFOOD\nThe Pad Thai delivers on all levels. If you really want it fire engine hot they will provide additional spices. The Panang Curry kicks butt. Spicy means enough to clear your sinuses but not make you cry. The dinner portions are ginormous. You could readily share a meal...but then there'd be no leftovers!\n\nI'd definitely throw in a Thai Tea if you've never had one. It's almost smoky in taste (yet sweet) and goes down too quickly.\n\nSERVICE\nI don't know how he did it, Michael must have eyes in the back of his head or something, but my Diet Pepsi was never empty. I slurped down three that I can remember. And he even offered to provide one to go!\n\nThis place rocks!\n\np.s. there's another location in northern scottsdale."
"3","Heard about this place from friends. Was excited to try it. Not really impressed. Food was just flavorful enough to not be bad. Meh....egg rolls were mushy inside. Sugarcane chicken was ok."
"1","I hate The Hub. It is just obnoxious. It all like \""I wanna look like I have nothing, but wanna pay through the nose for it!\"". I mean the brand Deisel alone makes me irritated. It so \""I hate my life! Its so hard!\"". Also the staff prertend to know the product, but if you ask enough good questions you'll find they know nothing more than you could have deduced. Eww. Yuck. gag."
"1","Horrible Customer Service!  No smiles, no personality, they called me \""You\"" the entire time I was there.  Very Bad"
"5","Although this store works mainly with designers, they do work directly with clients if you don't have a designer. They were very thorough in the process of understanding the room where the tie will be in, usage for the tile, and overall feel of the house. I worked with several of there associates and each one was better than the last on the three projects I did around the house. (Pictures attached)\n\nThere follow through process of letting me know when the tile will arrive, if I received everything undamaged, and if I need to place an order for some follow-on pieces was exceptional customer service and something I never received from any other tile or designer store. As it turned out in two of my three projects with them, I did need to buy more tile as my contractor miss calculated twice. \n\nThey are definitely not a big box store like Lowes, Home Depot, or Arizona Tile. Craftsman Court is unique, one of a kind tile, from all of the world. If you want to come home to the same tile that anyone can get from any big box store all over the country, then this probably isn't the place for you. But if you want something unique that separates from everyone else buying tile, this is the place for you."
"4","When I moved to S Scottsdale from Central Phoenix, I was so sad to leave Richardson's and Dick's Hideaway behind in my old hood . . .  until I discovered Carlsbad Tavern. \n\nI love my food with a little bite - it's comfort AND adventure on one plate. And unlike my central favorites, Carlsbad has plenty of tables ready for me to pop in on a whim. More room, yet it still feels cozy.\n\nOutside by the waterfalls with warming heaters - great for a first date OR a night with good friends!"
"3","Went here for brunch this morning (Sunday) and there were a few things that diminished the experience for me:\n* You claim New Mexican grub and then you charge for chips and salsa or sopapillas which are standard complements to any New Mexican restaurant meal.\n* At $3, the coffee is  a rip off! Seriously? We're not talking cappuccino, people and you're selling build-your-own Bloody Marys for the same price!\n* The carne adovada was tender but not very spicy.\n\nThat said:\n* The green salsa was really good.\n* I'm so desperate for carne adovada, I'll settle. (besides, $9 is more than a fair price for 3 eggs, black beans and carne adovada in a bowl on a flour tortilla - even if it was more beans than pork.)\n* There are several options for $5; and, if they are all like the eggs benedict, they are generous portions.\n* The patio is nice and the bar area feels like a neighborhood pub (not a cave, but that's not got to be a bad thing!)"
"4","My first experience with the \""Bat Cave\"" was an evening rendezvous with a friend of mine to watch a basketball game on TV.  It was a late night game, and to be perfectly frank, I don't remember who won - actually I don't remember much of the night at all.  It turns out that they had late night specials for food service workers, and we made the most of it.  But I do remember that it was a fun night, and after looking at the menu, I wanted to try some of their food.\n\nOne of the things that intrigued me was that most of the dishes had green chili's - either in the sauce or the actual dish.  Since I love chili's of all sorts, and had never really sampled authentic \""New Mexican\"" food, I was looking forward to it.  I tried the green chili stew, the Carne Adovado and  loved them.  Since then I have tried almost all of their menu items, and haven't found one that disappoints me, although I keep coming back to the Carne Adovada.  \n\nThe service has always been great - my beer never gets empty before another is brought - a really important consideration if you are eating the habanero sauce.  As has previously been described, the decor is a little different, and the bat theme a little over the top.  But it all comes together, and is a fun place especially later in the evening.  And the food is always good."
"4","i really want to give it 5 stars but my carne adovada sometimes is kinda fatty. i love this dish but hate sometimes picking through fat. they do have the best chipotle ranch ever!!!"
"4","One of my favorite restaurants!  Love the Enchantment Platter. The Habenero burger is the hotest hamburger I have ever eaten.  Its awesome but beware!!!!"
"3","Carlsbad Tavern is hit or miss for me. Their food is pretty good, and they have some unique options. Their New Mexican potstickers were good, except they were obviously microwaved. their filet tacos are good, except they have come out cold on occasion. Usually their black beans are delicious, however the last time we went they were ice cold, and had no seasoning, as if they had just come out of the can. The macacha beef chimi is really good, although it often has more onions than beef in it. The food here is spicy, so if you get indigestion easily I would pop a zantec before you eat! \n\nThe service is also hit or miss. Sometimes we'll get someone friendly and attentive, other time's we'll get someone that basically acts like a dick. I hate having servers that are dicks. It kinda ruins the whole meal. I work in the service industry, no matter how terrible of a day I'm having or how rude of a client I have, I'm still NICE. Not nice servers makes me sad. \n\nSorry, this review is going on and on and on. Basically, I like this place. I just wish they could step it up a little. Be a little more consistent, ya know?"
"3","This is a cool restaurant.  I didn't explore too much of it, but it has a nice bar and the outside seating area is really pretty, with multiple levels and waterworks.  When we ate here it was a little chilly still at night, so the heat lamps were appreciated.\n\nService was a little spotty all night.  We ran dry on water a few times, and it seemed like it took forever for our food to come out.  We had some chips and salsa (mediocre, unfortunately, and not free, doubly unfortunately) to tide us over, but things were definitely not moving quickly.\n\nThe main courses, though, were good.  I had the stacked enchiladas, which were so big and different they barely registered as enchiladas.  They had good spice to them, though, and I liked being able to have two different meats going on.  The fried egg was a bit unnecessary, though.  I was hoping for a runny yolk, because I love me some runny yolks, but it didn't have one, and thus didn't add much.\n\nTanya enjoyed her Tesuque chicken salad.  It did have a surprising amount of spice to it between the veggies and the tasty dressing.  The jalapeno bacon was good, too, but the tortilla crusted chicken was more crust than chicken, which was a bit disappointing.\n\nOur companions had lobster enchiladas, which seemed to be the biggest hit of the night, and crab stuffed poblanos, which were also popular.  I didn't get to try those, so that's just hearsay, but they appear to be safe bets.\n\nOverall, things were mostly good, but there were some little issues that held it back from being a great meal.  I would definitely come back, though."
"2","Disappointing. Nothing is fresh. Do not go here if you are interested in eating good food. This is a place to go with 'bros and chicks\"" I guess. It's a sports bar in disguise.\nI don't know why it has such high ratings. Rice-undercooked. Chips-store bought. Beans- worse than canned Trader Joes. The only saving grace was the jalapeno cucumber margarita-but even that was mediocre."
"5","Fun building to be in and great, fresh mexican food.  This place is off the main strip of old town but worth the detour."
"5","We absolutely LOVED Carlsbad Tavern! We weren't sure what to expect by the name, but we were pleasantly surprised when we walked in. It was late in the evening and we sat on the patio, which has a really cool ambience with the fireplace, palm trees and water features. We enjoyed a few cocktails from the Late Night menu, and at the suggestion of our server, we ordered the New Mexican pot stickers. All I can say is they were amazing. The sauce was so good, I could've seriously licked the plate clean if I knew no one was watching! (Lol) The only downfall is that we found this place on the LAST night of our vacation, otherwise we would've been back at least one more time. The atmosphere, service and food here is simply outstanding. Try this place, you won't be disappointed!!!"
"5","Tolan the manager is always super friendly! I've been going to Carlsbad for years so I am a regular, but that started because the service is friendly and the food is great. This is a very popular joint that's been around because they do what they can to please their customers. I'm surprised with some of the okay reviews (but you can't please everyone) maybe those people were having a bad day. Also a heads up the food is tasty and there are some dishes with some spice/flavor, that you may not think of so I always ask if it's spicy. You should go in this place if you haven't already. Yum!"
"4","Love this place. Surprised I haven't reviewed it already. I would say this is in my top few places to take visitors. You have the fountain, the bat cave thing going on, the outside seating around the water, and awesome food on top. Inside, you feel  like you are in an old lodge, adorned with license plates, memorabilia, fun things to ogle at while you swallow beer. Lots of beer. Because its great for drinking. The bartender is on top of things. \n\nNo wings here, unless you order the BBQ chicken, which I did. I order this most often when I go after breakfast. They make a spicy sauce and roast a half chicken to perfection, served with slaw and mac and cheese sides. The mac and cheese is a SW style, try it. Yummy to the bottom. You can order a whole bowl if you are carb-loading.\n\nI have tried many other things, they have really good burgers, many with a SW feel. \nIf you really want a treat, come for breakfast where they make these twisted benedicts and burritos that look like they came off a magazine cover. You will always bring food home and always have a nice time because, well. because there is lots of beer here. Fun, fun place."
"4","I really like the patio here and am looking forward to sitting next to the fire this winter. I love spicy food and New Mexican food in particular and this place does not disappoint. The copper bar is pretty cool, but the patio is unique and my favorite place to sit. My only complaint is that the several times I have been here service has been fairly slow. The servers were always friendly though. Sitting at the bar things seemed to move a little faster. Overall a local favorite of mine."
"2","I can't even begin to say how many poor customer service experiences I have had here.\n\nWe used to do lunches a few times a week at my old job and Zipps seemed to be one of the regular spots, although I always made a fuss. Rather than being stuck in the office and miss out on the lunch gossip, I always opted to go, and EVERY time, it was the same old story...this place is never too busy during lunch, but service is slower than the second coming. It would take 1.5 - 2 hours for the small group of us to make it through lunch. Not to mention that after consuming my first beverage, the glass would remain empty, my number one dining pet peeve. \n\nI do have to say that I can't completely hate on Zipps because their food really is good. They have awesome nachos and sandwhiches. I have never been disappointed with the quality of my food. And when I was having a calorie splurge day, Zipp's pizookie was the perfect way to do it! \n\nZipps gets a 2 star rating from me, but if they get their service act together, we can negotiate a better score..."
"2","Visited Scottsdale this weekend and was directed, by a local, to try Zips as a good sportsbar that would be close to our hotel.\n\nNursing a killer hangover from the night before, I ordered  a Coke to begin with.   The Coke tasted like they have moldy lines or something.   A couple other guys I was with ordered Mr. Pibb and each of their drinks had the same \""musty\"" taste as well.\n\nI had the jalepeno burger and fries and they were both pretty good.  Nothing out of this world, but decent.\n\nThe service was terrible.  Actual exchange between my friend and the waitress:\n\nfriend: I'll have the Caesar salad.\nwaitress: chicken caesar salad?\nfriend: No, just a regular caesar salad.\nwaitress: what kind of dressing do you want with that?\nfriend: I'll have the ranch (ok he didn't actually say this part, but i wish he would have)\n\nit's a freakin' CAESAR SALAD! Without the caesar dressing it's just a salad.  \n\nFood was OK. Service was...curious.  Beverages were bad."
"1","The customer service here is AWFUL!  The manager is less than nice, even at the best of times. \nI was at Zipps recently for several college ball games, where thank goodness Megan our server was amazing, because the rest of the service was horrible.\nNot only was I in attendance for bad behavior on management's part, but also able to read an atrocious letter written to a friend simply because she wrote a bad review.\nI will NEVER be stepping foot in Zipps again, and will be forwarding the letter to ALL my friends. \nThe food isnt that great, and the beer is cheaper is most other establishments, where management is generally nicer. \nI only wish I could give ZERO STARS!"
"3","Let me start by saying that if excellent customer service is what you are looking for, this is not the place for you.  Are the waitresses nice?....Sometimes.  Are they efficient?.....Not usually.  Do they get the orders right?.....most of the time.  Do I love this place anyway???.....ABSOLUTELY!  Here's why - \n\nValue of Happy Hour / Reverse Happy Hour / Weekend specials - 5 stars!  There are not many places you can get a slice of pizza, a basket of wings (Golden Medium, yummm) AND a 32 oz frosty beer for about $10 bucks.  They have daily specials, happy hour specials, weekend specials, and late night specials.  If wings are not your thing, try the Monaco Focaccia - it is to die for!\n\nAmbiance - Ehhhh - 3 stars.  This is just your typical sports bar.  No special ambiance to note.  However - bring your shooting skills, and give the arcade game Big Buck Hunter a try for some laughs, OR coerce your friends into playing some pool.\n\nI will concur with previous guests comments that the management at this establishment leaves something to be desired.  I have had several experiences where management failed to provide a service or take care of a customer, and was less than apologetic about their unwillingness to help.\n\nAll in all, I love Zipps - mostly for its convenience and it's cheap prices.  I'd still recommend it though! :)"
"2","Love their patio area with the tvs--it's a great place to watch football. However in my world, football and beers go together like peas and carrots so when I can't get a beer, I get sad....and a little mad. We couldn't get the attention of our server for the life of us, not sure if she was just ditsy or in the weeds, but she was basically non existent the whole time. \n\nThe crowd was really funky for it being Scottsdale: a few normal people, a man dressed like a pirate and your standard douchey people dressed up to watch football on the patio in 100+ degree weather. \n\nFood was decent I got the buffalo focaccia which had all the right flavor but kept falling apart.. Like Mexican food, it was actually better the day after. Parking is a beezy, I feel sorry for the poor people shopping at Sunflower since they have to share the lot with the place."
"3","We went there on a busy night. It is seat yourself and fight to the death for an open table. We finally found a table and there was only 2 chairs for 4 people. So whatever we borrowed some other chairs from else where. Ok. So the food.... Was great. However the service was shit. Slow, forgetting about our drinks, checks, etc for a while. I would recommend to eat here when it is not crowded, so maybe the service will be better.... Bc the food was delicious..."
"4","Ok so i had a salad.  Not the best but why would order a salad when their burgers with jalapeno sauce are so darn good.  Well all I had been doing while on a little trip there was eat.  i was just not hungry.  \n\nWe actually met about 18 of my sons' friends for dinner there.  So the company was already great.  Our server was excellent and all in all it made for one happy night.\n\nI know I will go back next time I am in town.  I promise to have a burger and fries.  I wish it was here in my town because right about now a burger sounds pretty darn yummy.  \n\nTill the next time."
"5","Food is absolutely unbelievable for a bar. Even the guacamole is amazing. Probably the best quesadilla I've had in my life and the green chili burger is to die for. Drinks are always filled and they always make sure you have everything you need (like extra guac). Great cheap eatery."
"2","I'm a fan of Zipps but the staff at this location are simply dense. I was served the most disgusting salad once there. I simply told the waitress I didn't want it but I had no problem paying for it. The manager comes out and proceeds to ask me what my issue with the salad was. I said to him that it's not a big deal and I should have known better than to get a salad at Zipp's. He still wanted to know what was wrong with the salad. I told him it looked like a 4 year old made it and he could bring the chef out if he would like and I could show him how to make a salad... I left shortly after."
"1","I go to Zipps quite often and nothing has ever been an issue, but last night while trying to enjoy a nice outing with my friends/coworkers things took a turn for the worst. We had friends show up early to reserve a table for 8, we met up with them and sat down, ordered drinks, and everything seemed to be going smoothly. But then throughout the night, rude remarks and attitude was given by the server (not going to mention names because you know who you are) . You could tell she just clearly did not want to be there. The main issue occurred when the checks were brought to the table. Everything was unorganized. With ALL of us  at the table working in the restaurant industry (including our manager), we DO understand rough days and the business. But I have NEVER felt so uncomfortable at a restaurant. She then proceeded to drop the checks off... one check book had a salad on it, I recognized it was not ours and put it in the middle of the table.  We situated our money and she then came by to picked up our tabs. But before she could even do that...she snapped at our table saying we had some other tables check book, I said \""yes, we put it in the middle of our table because it wasn't ours\"", she then says \""well where's the money that was in it\"" we say there was none that we had seen. She then pulls aside the table that the check belonged to as they are exiting and questions if they paid their tab... they say \""yes, with cash\"". She comes back to us (mind you making scene in front of the patio) saying it is \""impossible\"" that there was no money in it, assuming we stole it. Coming from a table full of servers we discussed that we would never accuse a table and track back steps before throwing accusations around...well what do you know, the money was on the floor. How did the manager handle it? He simply stated he would talk to her. I have never felt so offended and appalled by how we were treated. It is called customer service. Not only did she do that, but as other guests would leave she would lean out the patio while they were walking to their cars asking if they paid their tabs. Just very unprofessional. She then brings back our checks but one booklet has three tabs in it and she says the cash amount given was insufficient because she forgot a tab... at this point I thought it was a joke. We all gave her enough money, but at this point I felt she wouldn't get a tip because clearly she did not deserve one and pocketed the money, with our manager fed up, he took care whatever needed to be paid for because he just wanted to get out of there. I have never tipped lower than 20% even if the service was bad, knowing that everyone has their days. But being accused of stealing while trying to enjoy a nice evening is uncalled for. Her demeanor was awful and the whole transaction had me sick. I will not be attending this Zipps in the near future."
"3","My husband had been to Don & Charlie's 8 years ago and it was a \""must go\"" for this Spring Training trip. We arrived at opening and there were at least 50 people waiting on a warm St. Patrick's Day, which looked like a good sign. In retrospect, we needed the Luck 'O The Irish to turn this \""so so\"" meal into an exceptional dining experience.\n\nThe food was good -- coconut prawns, french onion soup, prime rib -- and the service was warm, pleasant and fast. Actually, too fast. We felt rushed to get through each course so they could clear the table for the hoards of people waiting to get in.  It wasn't anything to write home about, but worth another shot."
"5","Iv'e been going to Don and Charlies for years and it is always consistently been quite good.  Last night I had the baby back ribs.  I order them well done and they are moist yet crispy.  The sauce is a little sweet and a little spicy.  Coleslaw creamy style and the twice baked are home runs!  Don't forget to ask for the chopped liver and rye bread, it is the best I've had.  The chicken snitzle is a good option if you want to try something new.  If you get take out check your bags...things seem to get left off."
"2","Came here on Christmas eve because of all the hype. The price is an upsale restaurant, but the food is mediocre and the atmosphere is like a musty old sports bar. I didnt think anything was great about the place. Reminded me of a cafeteria. There are far better restaurants in the valley for the price."
"5","I grew up in the north suburbs of Chicago, and on Carson's Ribs. So, when we started vacationing in Scottsdale, we found Don & Charlie's! Carson's Ribs in Arizona...couldn't be any better! \n\nGreat atmosphere (steakhouse fancy surrounded by sports memorabilia), GREAT service (your water glass will never get less than 3/4 full) and GREAT food!!!  \n\nWhether you're visiting the Phoenix area or you live here, Don & Charlie's is a restaurant you definitely can't miss!!!"
"2","We went on Friday night to Don and Charlie's with some friends.  We didn't have a reservation so the wait was quite long, which really wasen't a big deal because I knew the wait would be long.\n\nThe owner saw that we we had been waiting so he found a table for us.\nThe problem was the waitress was quite busy and when we ordered our food she assumed that we would be sharing so she had everything split.  We asked numerous times for ketchup and she kept forgetting.  \nThe biggest problem I had was that I ordered ribs.  They were so dry that I had to pour lots of sauce over them.  Earlier that night the ASU football team was there, I think they cooked a ton of ribs and had extras that they didn't use, so then they served those to us.  They were the worst ribs I have ever had!\n\nI do love the decor and maybe the food would be better at another time."
"4","Had a great dinner this past week at Don & Charlie's and actually got to meet one of the owners. So cool.  Anyways, the food was really good. My favorite was the chopped liver appetizer (only regret is I ate it so fast and wanted more - it was that GOOD) and the filet mignon I had for dinner. The Caesar salad had a little too much dressing on it so next time will ask for a little lighter but nothing near drowning in dressing worthy of being sent back.\n\nThe atmosphere is really comfortable and not like a stuffy steakhouse I have seen at other higher end locations.  Lots of cool sports memorabilia on the walls. If in the downtown Scottsdale area and craving good steak, ribs, etc. Definitely check out Don & Charlie's. You won't be disappointed."
"2","My family and I moved to Scottsdale over 20 years ago and I have always had a place in my heart for Don & Charlie's.  We used to go there often for birthdays/anniversaries/graduations, etc.  It was my birthday this week and my parents wanted to take me out so I said \""Let's go to Don & Charlie's, I haven't been there in I don't know how long\"".  Sadly, after having eaten there I believe that I made a mistake with this suggestion.  The restaurant itself hasn't changed since the last time I was there - it's still got wall-to-wall memorabilia, it still has the same old-school steak house ambiance, but the feeling that I got during and after the meal was really one of a restaurant that is resting upon its laurels and not doing much to deliver a quality product.  My Caesar salad was made with lettuce that was obviously old - it was not wilted, but it was very soft and floppy with no crunch to it whatsoever.  My father ordered the creamy coleslaw which bore a great resemblance to cabbage soup so high was the dressing to cabbage ratio.  My mother greatly enjoyed her house salad with a balsamic dressing but this was mostly because she thought the balsamic was the best that she had had in a long while.  All three of us ordered baby back ribs for dinner - my parents just had the ribs, I had a combo with the ribs and a filet.  All three of us remarked that the ribs were \""passable\"",  the meat was tough and fatty - not at all what I remember in terms of quality from when I used to eat there.  I have honestly had ribs that I found more enjoyable at casual restaurants like TGI Friday's or Ruby Tuesday's.  When you are charging $30 for a rack of ribs, they REALLY need to be better than \""acceptable\"" which was the highest grade I could offer on these.  While ordering our entrees, my mother asked which ribs were more tender and our server informed us that the beef ribs were the most tender, but they had sold out of their entire stock of beef ribs already.  Our reservation was at 6:30 - fairly early in the evening, so my mother's reaction was \""Really?\""  His response - \""Oh yes, they were actually sold out at 5:00 PM.\""  This speaks to a lack of organization and knowledge on the part of management - if you are running out of a popular item by 5 PM on a weekend before proper dinner service even begins then that indicates a serious problem.  My Filet was better than acceptable - it was not as good as I remember, but still very good.  Unfortunately my disappointment in the ribs was such that it overshadowed any feelings I may have had about the steak.  Our server was professional and courteous and I did not notice any of the issues with the hostesses that some others have reported, but I really have to say that I am disappointed in Don & Charlie's.  It's one thing to go back to a place you have a fondness for and find the experience lacking in relation what you remember - we all have a tendency to look at the past with rose-colored glasses I think.  This was a case of going to a place that I have a genuine fondness for and find the experience lacking in relation to what I consider acceptable for any high end restaurant.  I believe my grade of \""Meh. I've experienced better.\"" is completely accurate - I have experienced better at other steak houses, at other casual dining restaurants, even hole-in-the wall eateries where I used plastic utensils to eat my meal.  I say this as someone who has nothing but fond feelings for D&C's - you guys need to improve, because a wall full of signed baseballs and dim lighting will only take you so far."
"4","We had a party of 28 to celebrate the annual J&J Bday Bash.  I loved the Yelp party experience, I am so torn on the # of stars!!!  This is a 3-1/2 stars review.  The service was 5 stars hands down.  Our server was more than I can ask for.  The food was ok, barely a 3.  \n\nFrench Onion Soup - It was cheesy, onion-y, and bread-y, but a little saltier than I like.\n\nNed Colletti's Chicken Schnitzel with lemon butter sauce - The chicken was a little dry and the lemon butter sauce was ok.  The baked potato was ok.  \n\nThe service was so fabulous!!  Maybe I should have gotten a steak?"
"1","My mother always said to me \""If you don't have anything nice to say,then you should not say it.\"" Well sorry Mom ,not going to happen this time.  I joined some old friends for dinner at Don and Charlies at the recommendation of my friend's family. To be fair I am a \""foodie\"",so this might seem a little harsh.  . The first thing I received when I walked into the place was the smell of mold mixed with some industrial cleaner,probably the most pleasant  aroma that I had throughout the evening and of course the duct tape all over the old carpet was quite attractive..My server  informed us that she had worked there for 30 years..Wow. Unfortunately for her time here she couldn't answer  our questions very well. We asked about the  so-called Prime beef ,if that actually meant Prime Grade  Beef  she seemed dumbfounded and if it was wet or dry aged.Also inquired what was in the rice pilaf ( vegies,stock etc) still no definitive answer,what size were the shrimp . We were not trying to harass the server we  have some  dietary needs and we were trying to  get some entrees and appetizers  that we could all share.We decide on  the chopped liver,the rib appetizer and a couple of wedge salads,caesar,and a french onion soup to begin followed by salmon,New York ,prime Rib,BBq cicken,Bone in Rib eye and ,halibut. The ribs were not very meaty and extremely tough  probably the worst that I have ever had,,french onion tasted like knorr beef stock and liver..and we all love pate, was quite frankly disgusting. The steaks were ok but not prime grade the salmon was previously frozen  farm raised Atlantic salmon the deli cole slaw was decent the creamy tasted ok but exactly like the Colonel's The BBq chicken was gross.,Halibut was so-so. All and all  my review of the place would be outdated cuisine prepared without skill or love but with the same price points as high end steakhouses in the area. The place just looks old and tacky with ripped chairs, old smelly carpet,.crud stuck beneath the tables and servers who  are as antiquated as the establishment..Comfort food? Only if you are comfortable with ghetto crap food . Sorry Charlie (and Don)"
"5","If you're planning to come here during Spring Training season; MAKE A RESERVATION!! They start taking reservations on their website a month in advance for this time of year, and there's a reason for that. It is very, very popular. We had a reservation for 8:15pm on a Thursday night in March. We arrived about a 1/2 hour before our reservation, and when I checked in, the hostess said our table would be ready around the time of our reservation. Not a problem. We went to the bar, got drinks, and then wandered around & looked/took pictures of all the incredible sports memorabilia on the walls/ceilings. The place is incredible.\nThe food: fantastic! If you check-in on Yelp, they've got an offer for a free onion strings or garlic cheese toast appetizer. My boyfriend go the prime rib & I got the ribs (\""Don's way\""). We both loved our selections. The ribs weren't fall-off-the-bone type ribs, but they were fantastic. I loved that there wasn't too much sauce. \nThe tables are pretty close together in the restaurant because they try to use as much space as possible. This ended up being great for us though because we met two awesome men who were on their 24th Spring Training trip together. They were very enjoyable to talk to & I'm really glad we decided to talk to them. They've been coming to Don & Charlie's since the very beginning, and we hope to make it a tradition as well!"
"4","We at here just over a week ago, on a Sunday night during Spring Training.  We made a last minute reservation, and didn't have to wait too long, even though the restaurant was packed.  The memorabilia is FABULOUS!  And definitely gives you something to do while you wait.\n\nI ordered the Parmesan Crusted New York and requested it \""Don's Way\"", which is charred.  I also ordered a side of broccoli and a salad.  The salad was fabulous.  I don't know why it was so good, but it just tasted great!  The New York Steak was the best steak I have ever had.  The charred parmesan crust was amazing!  I would highly recommend ordering your meat \""Don's Way\""!!!  The broccoli was just broccoli, which is what I expected.  The steak was also served with grilled onions and mushrooms.  Sooo good!\n\nThe only downside to our night was our service.  The waitress took forever to bring us our food, drink orders, etc.  She was just awful.  I would definitely go back to Don & Charlies, even though we had bad service."
"5","Great place. I was looking for a steak restaurant to take my mom to on mothers day, because she was in town for my graduation from CA. I wanted something classy, that was not full of families (aka - small kids) but not too fancy. Don and Charlie's was perfect. Just the right combination of class, style, and tastefulness. Not so quiet that it's awkward, but not too loud that it's annoying. I had the 16 oz New York strip  George Will's style (garlic on top) and it was absolutely amazing. The sports memorabilia is really cool too. I recommend this place to anyone."
"5","I have been going to Don & Charlies for years and am amazed how consistant the food and service is. Love the creamy cole slaw, liver, Seattle Salmon and especially the ribs. The memoriabelia is a Major League plus."
"3","The good and the bad. Everything taste good and the portions are large. We had the trout and the bar'q chicken. The coleslaw is also excellent. \n\nBut unfortunately overpriced for the far. $23 dollars for trout..really. 17.50 for bar'q chicken and salad was extra? \n\nSo if you want to spend a little extra, you will be happy. But if you are watching your cash...see you later Charlie."
"3","Such a great location for me and a fun little sports/dive bar. They have cheap pool, darts and video games and a nice little outdoor ghetto patio. They even have live music. I just wish you didn't reek of pee, rank beer and bleach :( I usually show up drunk though so the initial shock of the smell reeks havoc on my senses but then curls up in my nose, gets comfortable and I get used to it. The food is food, and I liked the sliders on mini croissant rolls. I've had a lot of fun here and would definitely recommend it as a last stop on the way home or for a game."
"5","I love this place.  Me and my roommate are regulars here (Marco and Ryan - the guy with the hat on all the time haha) and we love how we can walk like 2 minutes to get there.  The staff is great especially when they have Bryan back there cooking up the food.  They have great food for being a little dive bar.  Some nights are super dead, but there's usually a nice crowd on volleyball nights and friday and saturday."
"1","Oh My! where do I start?  The 3 sales associates that are sweet,kind and helpful must be recognized for their grace and class....But, I really wish this store would be shut down.  Rude,offensive,inappropriate and snotty is all I can say.  \n\nWhen I was pregnant...and wandering SFS aimlessly to get away from the 110 degree weather...a SA commented that I should check to make sure I was not carrying triplets....another SA comments that she does not know what she will do with the HUGE commission she will make by selling me a 50$ Theory t-shirt.  Another associate refused to set aside 2 pairs of Prada shoes because she wanted the commission right now...not later...she was trying to screw my regular sales girl out of the sale...in turn she screwed NM out of a sale all together.   \n\nI wrote a letter to their HO...got a call from the VP...who commented \""Well. we can't hold our Sales Associate's hands ALL THE TIME!\""...are you kidding me????? He did say that he would discuss each incident with the mentioned SA....Yes. I wrote down names...AND Dates.\n\nBut seriously, to refuse a return because you are going on break???? and to act like it MY FAULT for disturbing your glorious day at work? \n\nGet with it Neiman's!! this store is liability and so many out their would LOVE to have a job and would be glad to be helpful and kind to a customer.\n\nI would love to see that store turned into a COSTCO just like PV Mall...it's just what NM deserves.  The 3 SA's that do NOT deserve my scorn....go work for a company that makes people feel Beautiful,Happy and well taken care of...."
"5","I have to leave a great review for Mary-Kay, one of the sales associates at the fragrance counter. I walked in in Yoga pants and barefoot shoes wanting to look at Acqua Di Parma. Now I may not look it, but I'm willing to spend a dollar or two on a good fragrance. Mary Kay was SO helpful, she showed me every perfume she thought I might like since she's a big fan of Acqua as well. \nBecause of her service (and also the great scent), I've decided to go back when she is working and buy the big bottle, just to boost her sales. She deserves it. \n\nThis is opposite to what happened to me at Nordstroms. This lady kept giving me a snooty attitude. Lady, I've bought 4 high end perfumes in the last 4 weeks, so you missed out! I couldn't believe the way she treated me there. \n\nSo if you're shopping for fragrances, go to Neiman Marcus, not Nordstroms. And specifically, go to Mary Kay. She's sweet as a button.\n\nEDIT: Gotta leave a good review for the rest of the staff as well, including Kim. Just spoke with a customer of mine at my work who said the fragrance staff holds this store up on their shoulders. I haven't had a chance to chat with the rest of the staff, but yet again, I am incredibly happy with the help I received here. You can tell their hearts are in fragrances, you can see their excitement, and they're a blast. \n\n10/5 stars for these girls."
"4","Went to Uncle Sals last night for dinner with a bunch of friends.  We had a great time.  Friendly, gracious and efficient service.  The food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable.  We had everything from seafood to chicken.  Everyone raved about their entree."
"5","My family and I have been eating here for years.  It is a very unassuming restaurant in a strip mall location.  The food is always consistently great and the salad you get with your entree is the best.  Also, the garlic bread is amazing.  Some of the dishes I have had the pleasure of inhaling here are the lasagne, chicken saltinboka, fetachini alfredo, linguini carbonara, linguini and clam sauce, sausage and peppers, oh I could go on and on.  Also, they have a small bar which is dark and relaxing."
"5","Love this place. Truly one of the best Italian restaurants in the valley.. Great ambiance. Authentic Italian food. Very reasonable priced as well. Great service"
"5","I have never had a bad meal at Uncle Sal's. This is the type of italian place that has you unbuttoning your pants at the end of your meal AND taking left overs home! Great wine selection too!"
"4","Hadn't been here for a couple of years since I used to have my office practically next door. Had forgotten how good it was, and especially the garlic bread always brought for free at the beginning. Came with my wife, daughter and her boyfriend for his pre-triathalon pasta. Two huge chicken dished and two calamari Fra Diablos later, we were stuffed. One note - the Fra Diablo was too mild for my, and even my daughter's taste. I should have realized when I saw the much older clientele, typical of the neighborhood. Easily solved upon ordering. And the prices were incredibly fair, $110, with 3 glasses of wine, tax and tip for the four of us."
"5","Hands down the best neighborhood Italian restaurant in AZ. The veal, chicken and pasta dishes are all amazing. One of the best salads in town as well. The bar menu is one of the best deals as well, tons of food for not a lot of money. They also pour a great glass of wine."
"2","uncle sals is nothing special. in fact it's unspecial as in retarded in their customer service. the food is average but service is horrible. we have eaten there twice take out too actually. this evening. my girlfriend picked up the food and was told by the cashier that the salmon bruschetta would not be available so the kitchen left out the salmon and mamagement subtracted one dollar off the bill. complained right then and there.\nNothing was offered. This is the 2nd time our order was prepared with errors and not the tasty food we were anticipating.  My girlfriends seven year old daughter with the rest of her school mates could do a better job of preparing a take out meal.  When my girlfriend called Sal's again to complain the man identifying himself as the manager hung up on her.  \ni just read previous reviews where there is a cockroach infestion?"
"1","What a waste of money.  I got home and cleaned off all the missed spots and glass that wasn't cleaned.  Not to mention when I was there I was hassled to upgrade to everything, even fixing my windshield. WTF"
"1","Do not go here! Horrible service! Horrible attitudes!! Stay away!!!!!"
"4","Wild little place & great cheap-ass drinks! (a real shocker in old town).\n\nAlways busy late at night... and crazy busy on weekends.\n\nLove it around the holidays -- these guys must put up over a million Christmas lights!\n\nThe dive bar of dive bars in Scottsdale!"
"5","The best 'cool' place in Snottsdale!!! Kind of a dive bar but still totally popular. I just miss the ping-pong table. They must have ditched that for more table and bar space, which I guess is understandable but still. Anyway I love going there whenever. AND... it's one of the few Scottsdale places that serves (consistently) generous mixed drinks, if you know what I mean!!!!! And it never fails that I bump into great friends!"
"5","Oldest tavern in Scottsdale, and still the least Scottsdale of any bar in Scottsdale.   Go early, go late, its always good."
"3","I'm not sure that I've really had a lot of fun here, but I keep giving it another shot.  I think you need to bring a group of people here because I've found everyone to be rather cliquey and not into socializing outside of their own kind.  Maybe I just don't fit in and that's okay, the drink prices make up for it. \n\nI usually end up staying only long enough to finish one drink... which I end up downing just so I can go somewhere else.  I have a feeling that someday I will have a lot of fun here though, and maybe it will be around this Christmas.  You see, I have never visited the Coach House when it's all lit up for the Holidays and it is definitely on my list.  Maybe I'll see you there and we can have fun together?  Please, help me see what you see."
"4","Definite dive bar in Scottsdale, but fun all the same.  The regulars and the bartenders were great entertainment!  Cheap beer and good people watching...fun place for a Saturday afternoon!"
"1","Came here for the first time. A roach crawled on my arm the first five minutes. Not a good thing."
"3","Inexpensive.... been coming here for years and the bartenders are great. When u sit on the patio u feel like you're at a ranch. Some douche does happen here.... close enough to the border Of the Land Of the Lames.... but still pretty safe. Parties and grilling happen here often. Day drinking is a given"
"4","Let's face it, Scottsdale can be a real pain in the ass.\nDress codes, pomp, and general douchebaggery are not uncommon in this town.\nSometimes you just want to sit down and have a beer, sans all the nonsense.\nCoach house is your place.\n\nThere's a reason this rickety wood building is so popular.  Especially it's done up in tacky christmas lights! I It's easy, and fun, and super low maintenance.\nTwo bars ensure you are not waiting forever to fill your glass, and the addition of a food truck out front makes satisfying the beer munchies super easy."
"1","I heard the music from the sidewalk and wouldn't even walk in. What a basic and lame name. I did not see any reason to go in there. I would rather walk around and listen to Andre Nickatina."
"4","Place was good. Very friendly owners. Menu was good if you're looking to stay with a familiar territory. I could defintely tell this was a place many regulars go. We found John to be a very nice guy."
"4","Tiny little (I guess that's redundant) bar and grill that seems to have a regular following and serves simple, yet tasty food at a decent price.\n\nStopped in late one night.  Well maybe it was 9 or so, but that's late for me.  I went with the turkey philly spike style (jalape\u00f1o and green chiles) and potato salad.  The potato salad (house-made) was pretty good, and I'm extremely hard to please with that.  The philly was better than I expected considering it was smoked turkey and not ribeye, and the jalape\u00f1o and chiles definitely made it better!\n\nI can't remember the name of the guy working that evening, but he was awesome.  Even though he was tasked with both tending bar and waiting tables, actually one table, he was on top of things and made us feel like regulars.  In fact, I'm wondering now why I haven't been back.  Will have to rectify that soon!"
"3","The guy working there was nice.\nTheir food is not great at all.\nThere is a full bar, which is nice.\nThere is nothing on draft (all bottles).\nBut they accept credit cards, so that is good."
"1","My friends and I wanted to see the Flamenco show.  We had already been to Happy Hour so were not interested in dinner.  We ordered a small appetizer so as not to seem like freeloaders.\n\nThe appetizer was extremely poor quality for the price and was presented to us without one of the key ingredients.  The service was terribly slow, given the fact that the restaurant was nearly empty (another clue).\n\nThe Flamenco dancing was good but not worth spending the evening here."
"1","Terrible in every way, worse place I have eaten in recent memory and it is expensive.  This must be a front to launder money because I don't know how else they stay in business."
"1","The food was good. The service was horrible. The waitress spoke 10 words if at all to us. She was not happy being there. Manager was walking around but never checked in with us to see how was the food.  I ordered an ice tea and got one glass of it. no refill even after owner/manager passed by table saw the empty glass at the edge of the table 2 times. Waitress brought food, served over empty glass and did not asks us for a refill. The busser passed the table 3 times and saw the empty glass and did not offer more. I had to ask her for some more after that. I had a coupon for dinner and it stipulated that we had to leave 20% tip.. waitress ended up with a tip of around $17.00 for the worst service ever.. very disappointing and vouched not to go back. the restaurant needs a new decor also.. very dated. Save your hard earned money and go somewhere else.."
"3","Average sushi.  Young crowd.  Good happy hour.  Much better sushi can be had elsewhere, but it can be quite the swinging scene if you are into that sort of thing.  I used to come here when I was in college if that tells you anything..."
"4","we are huge fans of their reverse happy hour on sundays. we get great service and are out of there before the uppity crowd arrives for some fool-snobbery. ra is a great sushi staple in the valley."
"2","Good: the eye candy is delicious, and the udon is decent.\n\nNeutral/Bad: pretty much everything else. I couldn't hear but maybe 20% of what my dinner companions were saying over the blaring music, even when they were sitting right next to me. Overabundance of loud, obnoxious Guidos and douchebags with the obligatory popped collars and fauxhawks. I'm a sushi n00b, but even I could tell the bland, limp things my companions ordered were not right - if it's supposed to be tuna, shouldn't it be at least marginally tuna-flavored? The green tea tastes like coarsely-ground tree bark and looks like antifreeze. Finally, being in Old Town, parking is non-existent unless you're willing to walk from one of the public lots.\n\nI'm not going back, not even on a bet. There's plenty of better sushi places in the Valley."
"2","Meh.... we stopped here after arriving here at 11pm and just stopped here because it was the first place we saw that was open.  This place is definitely trying too hard for the cool and hip clubbing sushi place and it definitely had the loudest music of any place I've been to in that genre.  \n\nBut anyways, the food was decent, and it satisfied the Lady's uni craving.  Geez I need to find a source for those uni blocks...."
"3","This place hasn't changed in the years since I went to ASU, but why change a good thing? It's still packed to the gills and doing the same things it's always done. Pretty good service and food, and an incredible viewing area for hip, good-looking or wannabe hot people. It's fun if the only person you care to communicate with is your date, otherwise it's cruddy. The music is ok though! Just don't plan any romantic dinners here, at least not on the weekend! \nGo to see and be seen, and have a roll or two- they aren't bad at all."
"2","RA in Scottsdale has gone down hill slowly ever since the owners sold out.  We used to love going to the Scottsdale location and always thought Ra Scottsdale sushi was the bomb however not so much anymore. Granted if you are in to watching the \""$45K-millionaires\"" and \""recently divorced but look at my new breasts\""...then RA Scottsdale is the place to go. Avoid the Sushi as you will be disappointed and stay in their bar as they can pour a good drink."
"3","I called to make a reservation to celebrate my bestie's birthday here for happy hour. They don't take reservations. I also learned that no one could sit down until 75% of our party was there. We were expecting 10-12 people so we were able to sit down after the first 7 people arrived (after 20 minutes). It was really crowded. The music was way too loud! We had to shout across the table to talk to each other. The service and food were both good. I'll be back, but in a much smaller group so we don't have to shout to each other."
"2","Overpriced and not even very good. They were ok when I didn't know of better sushi options in Phoenix."
"3","\""A-OK\"". That describes fairly accurately my experience here. I imagine if I had gone for the teppanyaki I would have a higher rating, but I was in the mood for sushi.\n\nUnfortunately, the sushi selection here is extremely limited. The fish was nice and fresh, although not the best I've had. And there was a strange spice on the white fish that I found quite surprising. Not necessarily bad, but it seemed out of place. The tako salad was quite tasty, although it was absolutely drowned in ponzu sauce, so beware!\n\nOverall, I wouldn't consider this as a \""destination\"" to go back to; however, I wouldn't say no if I were invited to go eat here again."
"5","Awesome lunch specials for crazy cheap.  Greta sushi as well. Never had a bad experience."
"4","Sushi that won't strain your budget.  Kyoto Japanese has been my go to place for Sushi for 25+ years now.  Lunch is the best value in town.  If you are looking for a swank, place to be seen Sushi joint, then head down the street to one of the other plentiful Japanese / Sushi restaurants.  If you are looking for a place with good sushi at a reasonable price and a friendly staff to serve you, then visit Kyoto.  I did notice that they recently raised prices after 25 years but I think you can still afford it. The price for a Tuna Roll is now a whooping $4.  Come on....you can't beat that and it is always fresh.   The Teppanyaki tables are fun and entertaining.\n\nOh, almost forgot......A Sake Bomber / Sake with a 22oz Beer is just $6 (at least last time I checked)\n\n If you have not been to Kyoto, be sure to make this one of your upcoming destinations."
"1","My mom and I were drawn in by the reasonably priced lunch menu and convenient location- but we quickly discovered that the reasonable menu equated terrible food.  The lunch menu is priced so reasonably ($5-$8 for a complete bento box) that I worried about the quality of the food as we placed our order.  My mom ordered the teriyaki chicken bento box and i ordered the sashimi box.  Neither of us liked the salad dressing (too much ginger), although people who like ginger will probably enjoy it.  I literally had to spit out my first bite of sashimi (tuna).  It was the most fishy and rough piece of fish I've ever tasted.  It was absolutely atrocious and the flavor remained in my mouth long after i spit it out.  After that first bite, I decided against trying the other sashimi out of concern that I would get sick.  My mom's chicken was also terrible- she described it as tough and over cooked.  We politely told the waitress (an older lady, possibly the owner) that we were both unable to eat our meals.  She rudely informed me that the fish was fresh and there was nothing wrong with it.  (note: if that is what they consider fresh fish, then their standards are VERY low).  I apologized and told her that I was unable to eat it.  She grabbed the plate away, but refused to take my mother's food (stating that there was nothing wrong with the chicken).  Another waitress came by and we explained the situation to her.  She was very nice and apologized, and my mom and I left the restaurant.  The food was so atrocious that we literally left without eating!"
"5","Ahhhh......... where do I begin .........Moved here in 1994 with my husband and my 10 month old Lhasa-Apso boy, Cody..... ask Dr. Newland about Cody the wonder dog with the 6 out of 6 heart murmur.  Dr figured out the formula to extend his life for 2 extra years - you would have never known he was as sick as he was (neither did Cody!)  - always happy and playful without a care in the world.  We found Dr. Newland thru a friend and he took such awesome care of my Cody until his passing in May 2010. We added 3 more (Mickey, Sonni and Mc Duff) Lhasa to the family, and Dr. Newland cared for our 4 boys up until the last one passed in 2011 ..... they enjoyed long lives under Dr Newland's care ages 16 1/2, 13, and 8 (the last one McDuff passed suddenly from Hemolytic Anemia). The health issues that developed were always diagnosed and managed by Dr Newland very quickly - from heart murmurs, to neuro disorders to renal failure and cancer .. \n\nOur new generation of rescues are here - Sooshi, Duffy O and Big Jake - and Dr Newland is their doctor as well. We are always able to get an appt - sometimes same day - and Dr Newland gets it figured out. Always a smile on his face and the knowledge abounds."
"1","No bueno.  We read about this restaurant in one of the Moon's AZ books as a place to try for good, New Mexican food = not.  It was worse then Chevy's...the margaritas tasted like water and I got so sick during dinner from the food & margarita I was donzo for the night.\nAlso, you're definitely not coming for the ambiance, it's definitely a hole of wall.  It would've been fine if the food made up for it - but you're better off at a chain restaurant down the street."
"5","Sweet Jeebus, I miss this place. Dearly.\n\nWe were regulars at this awesome joint, and enjoyed sweet margaritas on the open patio in the back of the restaurant. This place definitely seems out of place when you first see it...right along the Scottsdale Art District, but you NEED to go in. \n\nI have many fond memories of this place, seeing as we moved back to Denver (and I can't seem to find a solid Mexican place here in CO that boasts both good food and ambiance), I dearly wish there was one here! Favorites of mine were the smothered burrito and the SOPAPILLAS with honey. \n\nThere was an unusual time when there was some kind of Elvis impersonator singing on the back patio, but it made for truly a one-of-a-kind experience. I will cherish my many memories of Frank and Lupe's, and will count the days until I can once again sit on that patio  with a marg in hand, and a smile on my face.\n\nThis place has some serious charm, and isn't for the uptight. If you want to get some good, laid-back Mexican eats on a warm evening, you can't find anything better than dinner under the stringed-lights of the patio."
"1","This place is the main setting of one of the most miserable nights of my life that didn't involve someone dying or me throwing up on my date or something.  Anyway, I'll spare those details and just focus on what a terrible experience this restaurant was.  To begin let me state in the interest of full disclosure that I live in Dallas.  This affords me the opportunity to eat some damn fine Tex-Mex, but it does not make me a Mexican snob.  I'm every bit as comfortable eating at a chain in my native St. Louis as I am at some of the better places I have found in Dallas or anywhere else.  All I ask is that it is good.  Frank and Lupe's is not good.  The people in my party wanted Mexican and several people affiliated with our hotel recommended Frank and Lupe's as the \""BEST MEXICAN IN TOWN!!\""  I see that in some of the reviews here, too.  Either these people are getting kick backs or Scottsdale has a seriously terrible Mexican restaurant scene.\n\nFirst off, upon our arrival we were quoted a wait time of 35 minutes inside and an hour on the patio.  Ok, guess we're eating inside, no problem.  Unfortunately, 35 minutes turned into nearly an hour to sit in the hot, cramped dining area.  We would have been much better off waiting for the patio and taking our chances.  There are few restaurant sins bigger than undershooting the wait time by almost half.  Off by 5 or 10 minutes?  Still crappy but it happens.  20+ minutes?  No excuse.  This highlights another problem with this place.  It is tiny.  There is no place to wait.  I guess we could have squeezed into the over-full patio and hoped for the best, but otherwise you're standing out on the street on a tiny crowded sidewalk with all the other unfortunate souls about to be subjected to the horrors that are apparently \""the best Mexican in town\"".\n\nAs you can imagine, after waiting an hour for a table, our party was starving.  Luckily we were at a Mexican place, so we knew we were getting chips and salsa, so we waited...and waited...and waited and finally we hounded the hostess after 10 minutes of sitting there with nothing on the table.  Then we got the \""chips\"" which were actually more like some thick bastard offspring of a chip and a taco bell chalupa shell.  Did I mention they were cold, too?  Warm chips can hide a magnitude of crimes, but not at Frank and Lupe's.  And the salsa was some watery, runny mess.  Yuck.  And what's that I see on the menu?  $2 for more chips?  Luckily the chips were terrible and they would have had to pay me $2 to take more of them, but seriously?  No one I have mentioned this to since has ever seen a charge for chips at a Mexican restaurant.  Was I reading this wrong?  Is this only if I don't order anything besides chips?  Surely it was, right?\n\nMoving on...after another good 10 minutes our waiter finally came around for our orders.  I ordered a number 6. I was presented a choice of a green or red sauce.  Being from out of town I asked for the waiter's opinion.  He told me he would get the red but \""its a little spicy.\""  This is important because it was the exaggeration of the century.  Before the meal came out I had finished my first diet coke.  Of course I did because it was like 30 minutes between getting the diet coke and getting the food.  Anyway, I specifically waited for another diet coke before I started the \""little spicy\"" meal.  Then I dig in and I eat...and I eat...and I eat.   In fact, I finished the entire entree before I even felt a hint of spice in my mouth, and even then it wasn't much more robust than Medium Pace picante sauce.  Huge disappointment.  To tell the truth, the whole meal was bland.  There was basically no flavor even under the \""little spicy\"" (emphasis on little, I guess) sauce and the rice was  apparently just plain rice with a little shredded cheese melted onto it.  So, we finished our meal, all massively disappointed, and then it was another 10 minutes until we could get the check and then after that we had to flag down another hostess to actually pay the check because our waiter was MIA.  You might say it was because they were busy, but we didn't start eating until almost 8 and by the time we were done closer to 9, the restaurant was at least half empty.\n\nThe biggest disappointment for me is how many interesting sounding places I passed by walking to this place.  Unfortunately, my party wanted Mexican and the hotel suggested this dump.  I had one meal out on the town in Scottsdale, on an expense account to boot, and I wasted it on this utterly forgettable hole in the wall disaster.  In fact, I take that back.  I will never forget Frank and Lupe's.  It goes on the Wall of Shame.  Learn from my error, fellow Yelpers."
"1","I realize that management is trying to keep the place as authentic as possible, there is a recurring theme in these reviews and eventually people will stop coming here, you have a great location and once upon a time an amazing restaurant.  The service and attitude of ALL staff is shocking, from the minute you arrive you feel like you are inconveniencing them.  You have a busy restauarant, if you do not have the kitchen capacity, do something about it, when you have a family with a baby, I would have preferred you told me to leave rather than seating me and making us wait for an hour for our food. And when it arrives you mess up the order and tell us that we can either eat what you put in front of us or wait another 20 minutes for the food we ordered.  And to top it off the food was cold, meat overcooked...absolute garbage. Is there any management on staff?  I never saw one and if there are they don't give a crap about their customers."
"2","Recently visited Frank and Lupes. Food was very good but service was slow. In fact, we had to go to the bar to order drinks because our waiter wasn't coming over to our table.  At the end of dinner, my dinner partner left the table to use the restroom, and our waiter came over and asked me if I was waiting to be seated......this after he had been already waiting on me for an hour and a half."
"1","A very poor excuse for Mexican food.  We arrived at lunch to find the place packed and had a bit of a wait, which despite the run-down lackluster interior, we viewed the popularity as a positive sign that we were in for some great food.  We were finally seated and were provided with food-covered menus and a basket of chips and watery, flavorless salsa.  The waiter finally came over to take our order after a long wait at which time we also requested some silverware and napkins.  After another ten minutes, he finally brought us some water and some well used silverware rolled in a paper napkin.  One would have thought that with salsa so watery, they would have provided us with some plates to prevent dripping all over the table, but the overall lack of cleanliness of the place seemed to suggest otherwise.  The chips themselves were greasy and bland and we only consumed some of them because we were both famished.\n\nAfter another lengthy wait, my veggie burrito finally arrived. I only managed to get through a few bites of this greasy, flavorless disaster before calling it quits and heading back to the office still hungry.  The burrito consisted of nothing more than soggy, overly greasy, limp, overcooked vegetables, of which spinach was the predominant variety.  There was no flavor to any of it or any spice, sauce, etc. that would give one the impression of eating Mexican food.  I have absolutely no idea why people would flock to this place.  The atmosphere is that of a dirty cafe with tables packed on top of each other and the food is beyond horrible.  While I avoid fast food at all costs, I can honestly say that I would eat at Taco Bell before ever coming back to Frank & Lupe's."
"4","In an expensive chi-chi district but has that neighborhood family restaurant feel. The casual outdoor seating with misters makes for a pleasant evening. Great big margaritas. Good service and nobody rushes you  Food is midrange ok, somewhat Americanized & not very spicy but solid selection."
"1","5 of us ate lunch there yesterday.  3 had burritos.  2 didn't.  The the three that had the burritos have been so sick all day today!!!  Vomiting, diarrhea, chills, aches.  Unreal.  My husband is a doctor and he reported this to the health department but they said they have to wait until more people report a problem!  We called the restaurant and they didn't seem to care.  My two sons and daughter in law are all still sick.  \nThey didn't eat anything but ice cream after the lunch and one son didn't even eat that.  So it had to be Frank & Lupe's.  I am so upset.  We drove home to CA with one son who was so sick in the car.  The sick ones are young healthy people.  Sure hope no children or old people eat there until they solve this problem!!!!!!"
"4","Our first time here after a long but great day at the ball park.  A little bit of a wait since the patio was closed for a private party.  Totally worth the wait.  We were seated in the bar area and were warned it would be tight.  Chips and not-salsa-but sauce were darn good.  Margaritas awfully tasty.  He had the #5 3 shredded beef enchiladas and I had the #26 3 fish enchiladas. Very, very good.  We liked it not just for what it is but also because of what it isn't.  Is great food with authentic taste; isn't food slathered in sauce & cheese."
"3","The stars I'm giving this place are for the food only. The chips and salsa were okay. I had their chicken poblano enchiladas and they were really ,really tasty. I went with my dad for his birthday because this is one of his favorite places to eat. I enjoyed the patio atmosphere also and hope the next time I'm in Arizona to eat here again. \n\nThe only problem I have with  the place is that the service was awful. Seriously, the worst. I would give the service 1 star or LESS .The waiter acted as though he was distracted the whole time. He never re-filled our chips. It took over 20 minutes to bring us our drink order (diet soda and ice tea) and we never got re-fills on our drinks either. He barely made contact with us to take our order. Thankfully I didn't have any questions for him because I'm not sure he would have stopped to answer them if I had. They were busy but only with a Sunday crowd. We didn't go on a weekend night when I expect delays and distracted waiters. This was at 5:00 on a Sunday. Thankfully their food is good and the atmosphere is nice because otherwise I wouldn't recommend this place based on service alone.\n\nI just saw on some other yelper's review that chips and salsa are only free the first round. REALLY?  Maybe I won't be back."
"2","I ordered the spicy shrimp whichis noted as very spicy.  It was so NOT spicy and NOT flavorful.  However I had a nice time inspite of the food....."
"2","The interesting things about Frank & Lupe's are the name and the decor but other than that nothing else really stood out. Oh except for the chips, great chips, but a restaurant can not only be about chips. The food was mediocre I didn't even finish my enchiladas which is rare for me didn't find it was worth the calories. Might be a cool place for just drinks and app's but certainly not dinner."
"4","My daughter actually dragged us to this place, that alone was a miracle that she liked a place sooo much to take US there, lol!  The place is nice \""mom and pop\"" feel to it.  When you first walk in, it looks like a little take out place.  Then, you look to your left and you see this adorable patio type dining area. Very pretty old world decor to it.  I felt like I was in Mexico eating.  My son didn't know what to get, so he asked the waiter what he recommended and he told us the #8. So my son ordered it and LOVED it!  The menu isn't huge but there is plenty to choose from.  Salsa was delish!  The only downfall is that if you are planning to go with a larger group, more than maybe 6 people, you might have a problem getting a table.  Definitely worth checking out!"
"4","Love this place for Mexican food and margaritas.  My fave is their fish tacos, but all their food is good.  Prefer their outdoor patio area to the inside restaurant."
"2","The food at this place was quite greasy and lacking flavor. I wouldn't call this place authentic as it's just a lot of fried food with greasy yellow cheese. I do NOT recommend this for visitors looking for authentic Mexican food."
"1","Got terrible food poisoning!  7 out of the 8 of us that went got violently ill.  Only my 3 year old son did not get it bc he refused to eat that night (thankfully). Even my 16 month old vommitted 5x and we almost had to take her to the ER.  Very scary!  The manager seemed minimally concerned when we called him.  The owner said he would refund us our money but has still not done so in over a week and will not return my calls.  It just doesn't seem like they care."

The bruschetta appetizer is a favorite and I've never been disappointed in the spaghetti and meatballs. My only gripe is that they don't offer Chicken Vesuvio, which happens to be one of my most favorite Italian dishes. I'd probably visit more frequently if they did. The service is really great. The waiters -- yeah, they're pretty cute -- are friendly, attentive and accomodating. Two thumbs up for Pasta Brioni!"
"2","I really wanted to like this joint, I havent enjoyed pasta for a few months and was really looking forward to consuming food here. Let me tell you, for as long as it was to actually receive and consume the food.... it was worth it. The food was phenomenal, that was about it. Unfortunately it was incredibly busy due to the marathon, as well as the auctions. Meal tickets were getting lost, it was mass MASS chaos. Our waiter seemed aloof, and then after a while he started getting it together. One thing I really didn't appreciate was the fact that when we got there they sat us by the door to the outside patio (which at the time was closed). After a while someone propped the door open and it was extremely cold. I asked the host (some guy with little man syndrome) if they could close the door, he annoyingly said \""Nope, can't do it we have people outside.\"" Before I could even respond, he took his little elf self and ran away. We also had our son along, this place is not so good for kids."
"5","We had dinner at Pasta Brioni the other night with my wife and some friends.  The atmosphere is quiet and inviting.  Max, our server, was very attentive and informative.  I normally eat chicken parmesan at italian restaurants but decided to expand my horizons and ordered the osso buco...what a pleasant surprise...very tender and tasty.  My wife and her friend had the home-made mushroom ravioli and said they were excellent.  We shared  bottle of wine and polished off the evening with home-made cheescake, which was to die for!\n\nI highly recommend Pasta Brioni for an evening out with friends or a date."
"4","It's close. It's cheap enough. It's a few feet from Scratch Bakery. \nAll these are great reasons to try Chaparral Cleaners and Laundry.\nI've been to a few dry cleaners where they \""can't\"" get stains out of the clothes, and won't even try -- WTF??? \nChaparral has never had any problems getting the huge coffee stains out of my white and khaki pants -- yes, I'm a clutz -- and they also haven't melted any of the beadwork on some of the other tops I've brought inhere -- and for that, I salute them."
"5","One of my friends dragged me here after she went on a trip to New York and ate at the original one under the Brooklyn Bridge. I had never gone because it looked so ritzy... not my style of pizza place from the outside. But once I walked in it my mind was changed! It was nice and cozy :)\n\nWe started out with drinks, I got a root beer cause it was 12pm and I'm not one to drink a glass of wine in the afternoon and guess what... they have keg Root Beer!! It is freakin amazing =))\n\nI ordered the mozzarella, basil, tomato salad and it was amazing... but I was confused that they had it under the salad selection and it isn't a salad at all; it is the traditional slab of yummy!\n\nWe also got the Pesto Pizza... with nothing on it of course & it was to die for, I could have eaten it all day!!\n\nThis is one of the best pizza places in town! The location is great too!! \n\nThe pesto pizza is amazing...  go there, eat a lot, its good :)"
"5","I'm dropping five stars for Grimaldi's for the total experience. Not only is the pizza delicious, but the decor is fresh and modern with a warm and inviting feel. The kitchen is open air at one end of the main room, with plenty of seating, and a good sized full bar at the other end. The service is quick, with very friendly and accommodating staff. Now to the food and drink. I had the Santan Brew Devil's Ale because they were out of the IPA, but I was pleased to find that the Devil was still hoppy and a good pairing with pizza... flavorful but not too strong. The pizza... man oh man the pizza. Definitely the best thin crust I've ever had. The cooking technique gives it a very nice crispy outside but soft inside. The cheese is always fresh mozzarella and both the traditional red sauce and white garlic are great. All the ingredients are fresh and tasty and worth the money. My last visit left me wanting more sausage but that's a small discrepancy in a solid track record. At the very least give it a try and if it falls short it's all good... it's just pizza people.\n\nOh almost forgot, the Canoli are awesome! Maybe slightly overpriced for the size, but well made and decadent."
"5","Yummy!!!!    Very good.   Wow, calzone personal can feed two.   :)"
"4","Went here for my birthday with about 12 people and we enjoyed out first experience at Grimaldi's. We had about 4-5 large pizzas and had a lil leftover to take home but boy was that the best pizza I have ever had!! A lil bit hard to find but this is my new favorite pizza place! :)"
"5","You want Italian? You're no where near New York? Go to grimaldis. NY pizza at its  finest. Great service, great food, great venue. Thank you!!"
"1","My girlfriend and I came in for a pizza later on in the night and sat at the bar on the 17th. Once we sat down we put our order in with the bartender. The bartender asked us if it was the first time we had been there, which it was. We were pretty hungry so we ordered a salad to hold us off until the pizza got out to us. We also ordered extra sauce for our pizza. A little over an hour later, we receive our pizza and never even got our salad. When we asked about our salad he just replied with, \""sorry, I forgot.\"" He also forgot the extra sauce that we ordered with our pizza. Overall, the pizza was okay at best. It tasted pretty dry, as though it had been sitting for sometime before actually coming out to us. Due to the poor service and mediocre pizza, I don't think we will be eating at Grimaldi's again."
"1","Bad, bad and more bad. Dirty,  unkept. A/C broke it i was 87 in my apt at 10 o' clock at night, took them weeks to handle the situation. They could seem to care less. I fixed things there  ( cabinets,  frige, sink ) and they still didnt return my dep. apt was left spotless and shampooed. They lost packages from the mail. There are roaches everywhere, who knows what other bugs. All in all just bad! I want to leave 0 stars!!!"
"4","Tonight was my first night checking out the Grotto, and after a bad service experience with another place close by, i was ready to eat anywhere at that point. \n\nI have passed the Grotto many times living in Scottsdale, and have often walked by smelling the aromas grazing my senses while strolling by...i love that they seem to always have their doors/windows open and the tables overlooking the street are fantastic.  \n\nAnyway, as Brett S. said , the service can be a little bad but it is definitely part of the charm.  Anyone who has every been to a real Italian \""joint\"" understands this.  I was almost pleased with how traditional the feeling was, as in \""if you don't like it, get the heck out\"" haha. It was also a very packed Friday night around 730, so i truly expected nothing but a wait anywhere we went, but we at least found a group of down to earth people entering and exiting wearing everything from jeans and a t-shirt like me, golf attire, to going out clothes. No matter your style, they treated you all the same.  Perfect!  (finding a place like that in Scottsdale is hard to do!)\n\nWith it being a Friday night and already having a bad experience with a previous place, i just wanted a square meal and to head home, so i didn't do as much sampling as i would have liked.  We started out with the calamari which came with a marinara sauce with a little kick to it.  It looks like they added red pepper flakes at the end, but it was a nice touch.  I had the house salad with vinaigrette dressing...and word to the wise, if you don't like onions, this salad (at least with the vinaigrette) comes with sneaky chopped marinated red onions in it...so beware! The blue cheese crumbles were a nice touch as well.\n\nMy friend ended up ordering the fettuccine alfredo and i chose the cannelloni. The fettuccine was much smaller portioned than i thought it would be, especially in comparison to my dish...so if you're very hungry, i would stray from this dish.  While normally a classic favorite, i didn't quite like the added spices to the dish, which seemed to be an Italian seasoning.  The alfredo sauce alone was to die for though.  The cannelloni was phenomenal.  Everything was cooked to perfection and flavored out of this world. \n\nPlease also note....when this food is done, it's coming to your table, steaming hot! So wait a few before you take your first bite because you'll probably burn your mouth in some way/shape/form! :o)\n\nOverall the Grotto really picked up my night, and being a yankee in a western state...it's nice to have a piece of home right around the corner.  I'll definitely be coming back!"
"4","Great reception upon entering and great food!  No one will be disappointed (unless you are looking for a real fancy place with fancy menus), but I bet the food at the Italian Grotto is better!"
